"Silva checks off all the boxes, but efficiency doesn't equal enjoyment","Smug, formulaic, and downright boring.... Yes, I'm talking about a Daniel Silva novel. I can't believe it either. But this latest effort--much of which was a tedious info-dump--manages to be both preposterous and dull.<br /><br />Whereas Silva's background as a journalist brought his previous novels to life, The Cellist reveals a mastermind who no longer endeavors to (or is no longer able to) distinguish between fact and fiction. Even at Silva's best, he's been unable to resist the temptation to inject himself into his stories. I don't mean in the sense that all authors are reflected in their works; every character, after all, reveals something about its creator. But I've always gotten the impression that Silva is absurdly pleased with himself: little comments here and there throughout the series seem designed to jerk the reader from the narrative and remind them of the genius behind the fiction. And in the case of The Cellist, the fiction simply isn't all that great. I kept waiting for the real Gabriel Allon to show up. About halfway through my slog-of-a-read, I came to the sinking realization that he'd been there all along. And that I no longer care for him. Gabriel hasn't aged well; he's a shell of his former intriguing self. No-- not a shell. A puppet. Gabriel Allon has become little more than the mouthpiece of his creator. The author's prerogative, to be sure. But it's not the reader's joy.<br /><br />Perhaps it really is time for Gabriel to ride off into the Venetian sunset.",1.0,0,2021
Corruption or Public Service? Autocracy or Democracy?,"This was a better read than I expected. Schiff begins with his experience during the Jan 6 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. It is, of course, a defining event of the Trump presidency and a turning point in our history. On January 6th, for the first time, many Americans realized how easily we could lose our democracy.<br /><br />He then goes back to his personal history, how he became a successful prosecutor, then lost several campaigns in California before finally winning. Congressional Democrats noticed, and asked him to take on the incumbent Republican congressman in his district. Schiff’s victory was a big deal for about 6 weeks--and then he realized he was one of 435 members and should remember to focus on public service, not expecting fame.<br /><br />He describes what the House is like, including political divisions, the seniority system and having to conform to party discipline. He names some of the Republicans he feels are more in it for themselves than for public service (McCarthy, Gowdy, Jordan, Gaetz are a few of them, with examples.) He revisits the Benghazi hearings which turned into a political effort to make Clinton look bad in an election year, and foreshadowed some of Trump's strategies.<br /><br />He goes into depth on the Russia investigation and how Barr distorted its conclusions. Schiff criticizes Mueller's House testimony, but attributes it to cognitive decline rather than, as it appeared, an unwillingness to criticize Trump. (Mueller, as many remember, refused to even read aloud from his own report.) Schiff includes his ""It's Not Okay"" speech, which is well worth re-reading.<br /><br />Mueller's failure to tell the public his conclusions emboldened Trump who made his infamous Ukrainian call the following day. Schiff was the House impeachment manager when Trump went on trial for his conduct in the Senate so this book is also an important historical record. In spite of the President’s abuse of power and corruption, he writes with some positivity here about public servants like Marie Yovanovitch. Schiff wonders ""how many, if any, witnesses"" would have come forward without her example.<br /><br />He concludes with the final year of Trump's presidency--which begins with the ""disaster"" of the coronavirus pandemic and ends with 350,000 Americans killed by it. It also ends with the nation’s first insurrection at the Capitol. This, after Trump and the Russians had spent the year spreading a steady disinformation stream about the ""rigged"" election and the likely ""voter fraud"" if Trump didn’t win (despite polls showing all year long that his loss was very possible). Schiff goes into some of the state Republican efforts in 2020 at disenfranchising likely Democratic voters, an ongoing effort.<br /><br />The final section is about January 6th and the second impeachment and trial, The earlier themes come together here—public service vs. corruption and self interest; democracy vs. autocracy. Schiff is genuinely surprised that many Republican colleagues whom he admired and believed to be sincere in their beliefs and principles have been so easily coopted by Trump and his power .<br /><br />Schiff's final conclusion is that ""the GOP has become an antitruth, antidemocratic cult organized around the former president."" He also warns how Republican legislatures in many states ""took the big lie and ran with it, using false charges of voter fraud to usher in a new generation of Jim Crow laws....""<br /><br />Congress has been weakened during the Trump years, but, in spite of this Schiff looks at the strength of the Constitution and the strength, historically, of American democracy, and remains cautiously optimistic. This is a look at one of the most important periods in our history, told by a Democratic leader who had an central role in it. It is very much worth reading.",5.0,1,2021
Well written and researched; amazing recap of the events leading to 1/6,"Yes, it's well written and well researched. You'd expect that from these two respected Washington Post reporters. It's hard to organize material like this--over 140 interviews, so many quotes and events. They do a great job of it, focusing on Trump's ""catastrophic"" last year--his failures with covid, George Floyd protests and his desire for a military response (welcome push back to this from Milley). Barr gets some welcome push back from Geoffrey Berman before Berman is fired. Berman's effort was important.<br /><br />These are the things you like to read--people standing up for what's right, even when it means taking on the rude, often profane and angry President. It's the same way when they get to the insurrection--we see some advisors who are normally so slavish (Barr, Pence, e.g.) standing up for the country. This is an important historical document as well as excellent journalism.  Rucker and Leonnig show us the events and recreate many conversations (obviously checking with both sides as they include the denials that such conversation ever took place and leave it for us to decide whom to believe).<br /><br />It's a long book, and very impressive how they weave so many people and events and situations together so seamlessly.  At times, I wished they judged these people inside the administration a bit more; yet I guess there's enough detail for readers to judge for ourselves.  Re-reading the last part of it--on the insurrection--I appreciate their approach more than I did the first time through. It's actually rather amazing that two readers with different political views of Trump and his presidency could probably read this and not be put off by what Rucker and Leonnig are writing. They step past many opportunities for ridicule and have a respectful tone toward nearly everyone--not so easy.<br /><br />Trump's catastrophic last year, truly is one for the history books--from the botched covid management, to taking the wrong side in racial justice issues after George Floyd's murder, to an actual insurrection instigated by the President of the United States.  The lengthy section on the insurrection alone justifies reading the book, in my opinion.  It is a pivotal event in American history and, some day, will define the Trump presidency.  It's easy to forget just how complicated it all was because of how smoothly they bring it all together. Impressive.  Also, time has passed and more information has come out since this went to the publisher but it doesn't seem at all dated. Actually, they made news with its publishing, including General Milley's reaction to what was happening after the election. A ""Reichstag moment"", think of it. (I do wish those in the Trump administration were being held more accountable here, since he could have easily won a second term and many of them seem to regard that as a threat to democracy and the country. They should have--should have--done more, including going public. The authors are, in my opinion, too kind in the face of a lot of complicity, but I suppose that is for someone -else's- book). In time, I'm sure we will learn more--particularly regarding what was happening at the White House--but I think this book will stand the test of time.<br /><br /> ""I Alone Can Fix It"" gives us a lot to think about, including how close we came to losing our democracy. And how easily--really easily, particularly if the leader was a smarter, and more strategic--something like this could happen again, only successfully.",5.0,1,2021

Should have left politics out,"I couldn't get past the snarky political comments that were thrown in just to be nasty. They certainly didn't add anything to the book. I stopped reading after the fifth one. I don't care about Mr. King's political views. I own 65 of his books. I loved all of them. Lately, his work, like this book, is subpar. This one was the worst yet.",1.0,0,2021
It picks up in the second half,"I wanted to like this book. Bender did so many interviews for it – 150 with Trump and those connected to the campaign or administration.  It's so difficult to organize all that into a smoothly flowing narrative, which he does.  Also, it gets better when he gets to 2020, particularly with regard to George Floyd protests and Trump's disproportionate reaction to them.  Maybe its more interesting because he's describing people around Trump who are more interesting and smarter than the campaign types. (Milley speaks for many when he tells Stephen Miller to ""Shut the f- up."")<br /><br />I think my problem with the book overall is partly the generally morally neutral tone (this is Donald Trump, after all), and partly that there's too much (Trump Republican) politics and too little historical ""big picture"". (With a few exceptions. Like pointing out Trump's ""forgotten man"" appeal in the campaign turned into taking away the things FDR gave -his- ""forgotten man"" once Trump was president.)<br /><br />If you're a fan, it's probably not flattering enough.  If you're a critic, it ignores too much.  .  There’s Trump and his campaign and administration supplicants on every page.  No Democrats, except through Trump’s eyes. When they impeach him over Ukraine, Trump mocks Pelosi, holds a strategic rally, isn’t happy about it but spins it as a “victory” because all House Republicans voted for him.  Do we learn about the Democrats' case for impeachment? Some of the words they used? Ideas they developed? The interesting witnesses? No, it’s all seen through Trump’s eyes and the political operatives around him.<br /><br />(I already had a flash of disappointment when Bender described Trump Tower as “68 stories” tall. No. That’s Trump’s fiction.  It’s 58 stories tall, which Bender surely knows, since he’s interviewed him there and seen the way the elevator is marked incorrectly. It's kind of a metaphor for how much of Trump's (false) reality gets uncritically shared here.)<br /><br />I was very surprised how he writes quite a bit about the 2016 campaign, but it's so superficial. Very little about Clinton. Next to nothing about Putin and Assange's interference--cheating--on Trump's behalf.  Similarly, there's next to nothing about the special counsel's report.  A good time to correct the record--point out just how much Trump lies and gaslights--but...no.  Of course, he picks up on some failures and mistakes (covid, Floyd, insurrection)—but it’s still too flattering.  Way too much nonsense about Hunter Biden..<br /><br />Trump, the centerpiece of everything, seems a small man with a grandiose self image, a bully with nothing of much interest ever on his mind other than showing he's not weak. His lie about winning unspools here without a lot of editorializing from Bender.  But he's much worse than all this (see historians' recent rating of presidents:  He's #41 of 44 and likely to drop to the bottom next time).<br /><br />If you like Trump--or at least don't hate him--and enjoy insider politics with an emphasis on one side only--you might enjoy this.",3.0,0,2021
America's Sweetheart is really a Mean Girl,"Yes, Katie Couric has had an accomplished career, as entertainer and in tv journalism. This book makes clear she is far more an entertainer than she is a journalist.  In this memoir, what she cares most about in life are the things of entertainment--money, celebrity, and standing out in a crowd, especially a crowd of VIPs.  She's certainly a savvy self-promoter and competent as a tv newsperson (the Sarah Palin moment showed the rewards from persistent questioning that we always need more of.)<br /><br />But she doesn't come across as actually ""smart"", because--for all the opportunities she's had, she regards it all so trivially.  Has she learned anything meaningful from her apparently rich experiences? It doesn't seem so from ""Going There"" which she says expresses her real self.<br /><br />She was, from the beginning, well suited to television: cute, and an extrovert with a great smile.  Yes, she succeeded in a male-dominated field, but she seems to have played the game to do it.  She has an off-putting double standard for men and women.  She seems loath to criticize bad behavior in famous men, giving sort of a wink or a shrug to much of it in those she mentions (Sam Donaldson, Larry King, even Matt Lauer.  Dinner with Jeffrey Epstein doesn't mean much other than to archly note how her boyfriend pointed out ""how young"" the women were.  And how young were they? She doesn't say, or seem upset by being even tangentially part of his world.)<br /><br />Most people who knew her from the Today Show remember how mean she was to Ann Curry who, by comparison to Couric, always seemed genuine. I never understood it--Curry, professional, beautiful, reserved--seemed no threat to Katie's dominance on ""Today"".  But in this memoir, you can see she's just kind of mean to other women. It's no wonder that one of the young women Lauer abused told Curry (who reported it), but didn't tell Couric.  What woman would trust Katie with something like that? Here, she seems to criticize Lauer just as much as she has to, while often blaming his victims for not being as strong and assertive as Katie is.  She publishes her emails to Lauer--and his to her. Also shares private emails to her from others, also apparently without their permission.  Another Mean Girl move.)<br /><br />She's still mean to Curry here, repeating a ""joke"" Katie made at a Lauer roast even though she knew it hurt and humiliated Curry then.  So let's do it again, for all time, in a book.  (It was, btw, crude and unfunny even then.) She was hostile when Ashleigh Banfield got hired because Banfield was smart, pretty, and younger than Katie. She gets in digs at Deborah Norville, whom she permanently replaced when Norville went on maternity leave, for supposedly being unrelatable to viewers because of being so perfect. (It sounds like a compliment here. From Katie, it's not.)<br /><br />She snits about Martha Stewart not having a sense of humor until she went to prison. And on it goes. She doesn't mentor anyone because what if they're better than she is?  Even at CBS News, making top dollar at $15 mill a year, she has to still be the mean girl, head of the pack.<br /><br />She even felt threatened when her husband, a lawyer, became a legal analyst on television. ""He should stay in his lane,"" she thought.  (Yes, she eventually tuned in to his illness and suggests she blames herself. But is it a pose or real remorse? With Katie, she discloses a lot of unflattering things, but her real feelings about them are hard to tell. And, yes, she's done good work to educate people about colorectal cancer and screenings. She does charitable cancer work. That's commendable, but also benefits her public image, which seems never far from her mind.  Too harsh? Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />What really put me off wasn't all her digs at other famous women.  It was the way she took out after her daughter's nanny. She used a different name, but the real name is out now as the woman felt she needed to defend herself.  Couric wrote such insulting descriptions of her (a woman who was basically ""co-parenting"" with her for three years, but who Couric concludes had developed an ""unhealthy"" role in the household, ""making"" Couric abnormally dependent on her.) It's all kind of weird, unflattering to both, but particularly to the nanny who, in interviews, has said much of it wasn't true, and has supplied her own unflattering descriptions of Katie.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the nanny isn't a public figure with a best-selling book that millions will read and believe. It's a vintage mean girl move from Couric, but not surprising. As she often comes across here,  Couric's self-centered, competitive, intellectually shallow, vain, petty and really -not- much of a ""sweetheart"".",2.0,0,2021
Gossip--for the history books...,"This insider account is different from the others like Bolton or Comey because Grisham's #1 preoccupation is the personalities of the people around her. Some, like Jared and Ivanka, come across as both imperious and incompetent. (Ivanka frequently pulls rank while Grisham blames Jared for many of the failures of the Trump presidency--covid among them. When they interject themselves into a dinner with the Queen of England, Grisham compares them to the Beverly Hillbillies--basically, inappropriate and not knowing their place.)<br /><br />Of course, most of the anecdotes are about the First Lady and President.  Grisham was with Trump from the 2016 campaign until the Jan 6, 2020 insurrection when she quit.  (She first texted Melania if she'd like to issue a statement supporting political speech but condemning violence. She received one word from the First Lady who was busy with a photo shoot of a new rug...""No"".)  Melania, though generally detached and apathetic about her role,  IS energized by her many photo albums of herself as First Lady. Although per Grisham, they occasionally tamped down a Trump tirade or attack on someone, overall Melania agrees with him and isn't interested in the opportunities history has given her--other than the vanity projects for herself--photos, tennis pavilion, etc.<br /><br />Many people have objected to this book since Grisham was Trump's press secretary for 9 months (our money paying her salary) and never gave a single press conference. (Is the irony of the title intentional?) She was at one time Melania's press sec and, at another, Trump's, giving her a unique look at it all.  She notices the things that matter to her--Trump's rages, Melania's essential coldness (Grisham offers to comfort her with a walk on the beach as a friend after the Stormy Daniels' story, only to find Melania wondering if photographers will be there.<br /><br />Grisham can't really explain The Jacket with it's ""I Don't Care. Do U?"" message but reading about Melani it seems pretty obvious. (Trump, furious, made up the story about it being a rebuke to the press.)  Why did she remain in this toxic, crude, often sexist environment? (Trump, in front of her, asked her boyfriend--a WH staffer--if she was any good in bed.  At another time, on AF1, he asked if her teeth were really her own. She describes how he would call an attractive aide in to see him so he could watch her a** as she walked out of the room.)<br /><br />There are so many lowpoints for people who think about the office of the presidency and its history.  She will be criticized for this book--and for being part of this administration--but its a good document, in its way, of people who were not worthy of the position that was given them.  (Why did Grisham stay? Like so many others, two words:  personal ambition.  Like Trump and others around him, she put herself and her well-being first.)<br /><br />Grisham's book won't change anyone's mind --now-- but it will be part of future historians' invariably unflattering descriptions of the 45th president. In this it will sit alongside Michael Cohen, Comey, McCabe, Bolton et al as remarkably and consistently unflattering portrayals of an American president, including his intellectual limitations and character flaws.  There's never been a president like this one and, despite the adultation of the millions of Americans who adore him, history will not be kind.  In that context, this book in its focus on personality and character over policy is a worthwhile read, despite the moral failings of the author.",3.0,0,2021
Convoluted narrative for a simple message,"I don't have a Nobel prize nor expect to get one. So maybe this review is reflective of my dumbness.  But this book was nothing like ""Thinking Fast and Slow"", primarily because the core concept seems simple enough but beaten to a unnecessarily nasty pulp.<br /><br />The basic premise seems to be that decisions have noise in them (duh) and its important to understand that we should evaluate the decision making process and not just the outcome.  Accuracy, Precision, and Bias are terms familiar to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics; for others, a couple of early examples focusing on shooting targets easily educates the three terms and their differences.  The authors keep on stating the same concepts in a number of ways for the first 5-6 chapters.  And very often, simple observations are turned to very dense phrases without really serving any purpose than trying to sound very academic or scholarly.  (For example, ""..what they are trying to achieve is, regardless of verifiability, is the internal signal of completion provided by the coherence between the facts of the case and the judgement.  And what they should be trying to achieve...is the judgement process that would provide the best judgement over an ensemble of similar cases"") .  Then the authors spend a chapter or two differentiating ""predictive"" and ""evaluative"" judgements only to conclude that the difference is ""fuzzy"" (genius observation) and a decision will usually require both.<br /><br />If you are able to grind your way through the first 3 Parts (12 chapters), you will be able to pick up some new insights in Part IV and V that discuss on how variability/noise occurs and their various sources.  Conducting a ""noise audit"" and what constitutes decision ""hygiene"" are sections worth reading for those whose roles require constant synthesis of inputs from various experts/sources/stakeholders etc.<br /><br />Overall, the unnecessarily dense style that overcomplicates a simple message, lack of a clear target audience, and a narrative arc that just takes too long to provide new insights or provocative thoughts, makes this a fairly dull read.",3.0,0,2021

The American Dream--plus putting the Constitution/country above one's own self-interest,"This is a brisk, interesting memoir.  Most readers  will remember Lt. Colonel Vindmen--44 years old and in full dress uniform--testifying at the House impeachment hearing.  His opening statement made quite an impact because it wasn't only about the  events in the White House that the president was being impeached for, but also about his own first-generation immigrant experience and what protecting and valuing American democracy meant to him.  The book is like that, too, but of course, in greater depth. I enjoyed the descriptions of his childhood in Brighton Beach in the 1980s.<br /><br />Shaped by his family and also his military training, he writes about the importance of listening to your moral compass, even when you have to pay a price. In Lt. Colonel Vindman's case, the price was a lost career, lost promotion, and suffering vicious public attacks from rightwing officials and media.<br /><br />It's good to read that, after all he's been through, he would absolutely do the same thing again.<br /><br />Vindman describes himself  s a ""late bloomer"", but in his 20s began to discover his talents, including ability as a leader in the Army.  He goes from a platoon leader on a training mission in South Korea to combat in Iraq where he's wounded by shrapnel. He trains to become a top expert on Russia and Ukraine (where he was born when it was the USSR). That sends him to the Pentagon and then onto the NSC.  In 2019, he was in the Situation Room translating and taking notes of President Trump's now-infamous call to Ukrainian president Zelensky.<br /><br />He knew immediately that what the president had said in the call was ""corrupt"" and needed to be reported. He did it—with trepidation, but also with determination to do the right thing. He never expected that report or his call notes to become public. (The NSC lawyer improperly hid his notes in the codeword protected, highly classified, server.)<br /><br />Vindman thinks a lot along the way about what makes good leadership, and he shares those ideas. It's good to be reminded about what public service should look like--and how important it is to not just be pursuing one's own self-interest, but to be willing to put the country and the Constitution first, even when it isn't easy.<br /><br />Although he doesn't specifically say it, there is an obvious contrast here between those who bravely and honestly testified to Congress and President Trump, who made many smears of these public servants but refused to ever be under oath--not to the special counsel, not in this impeachment or the second one. ((of course, this list of people to thank for courage in impeachment #1 inc. the whistleblower and IG Atkinson who showed their own integrity before the hearings.) Sadly, we see the president use the power of his office to corruptly pursue his own self interest even when it hurts U.S. national security.<br /><br />Interestingly, many of the features of Impeachment #1 described here were also present in Impeachment #2, including the disruptive machinations of Rudy Giuliani.<br /><br />We don’t give out medals for speaking up against corruption—in fact, Vindman lost his career and his promotion to colonel for doing it--and finally resigned from the Army. (Also making his choice to expose the president's corruption difficult was the conflict with his beloved father who begins here as a firm Trump supporter). But Vindman ends with an honorable spot in the history books, new career beginnings in his life, and still a belief that ""Here, right matters"" --although you have to fight harder for it than we expect.",5.0,1,2021
Irrefutable Proof The Landings Were Faked,"As a 24 year USAF veteran, I wish it were not so.  Bart provides so much proof the landings were faked, it is overwhelming.  In a way, after of 50 years of inability to return to the Moon, it seems more implausible that we were able to go--six times on a slide rule--than these events simply being staged.<br /><br />After following Bart's evidence to the logical conclusion, I find that even more smoking guns emerge.  The fact is, this was hard if not impossible to fake, and NASA, surprisingly, perhaps because they were rushed, did a poor job faking the missions.  There are astonishing mistakes.  Bart does an excellent job documenting a large number of mistakes, but there are more.<br /><br />A handful of problems that I find impossible to dismiss are listed, below.  Some follow Bart's revelations a little farther, and a few are different.<br /><br />1.  No gravity on the trip to the Moon and back.  As an Aerospace Engineer and USAF pilot for 20+ years, I do understand the physics of weightlessness in orbit.  Apparently, the orchestrators of these missions missed that class.  Namely, that weightlessness only occurs in planetary orbit, it is an artifact of falling at the same speed as the curvature of the planet, below, falls away from you.  The typical classroom thought experiment envisions shooting a canon.  The farther you shoot, the farther the shell travels as it falls.  If you shoot far enough, you'll actually hit yourself, as the shell circles the Earth.  Shoot even farther and it'll complete more than one orbit.  Shoot at just the right rate, and the shell will fall at the exact rate the Earth's surface curves away, and the shell will go into orbit.  That constant falling is why an orbiting spacecraft feels ""weightless.""  But on a trip, radially away from Earth toward the Moon, the astronauts will absolutely feel some weight.  Yet, Aldrin does several experiments demonstrating weightlessness, half way between the Earth and Moon, even showing the Earth as a full globe out the window which Bart beautifully debunks as a portion of the Earth's surface, filmed while in orbit, shaped by the circular port hole window.  The demonstration of weightlessness actually proves the astronauts were in Earth orbit, not half way to the Moon.  The weightless experiments, broadcast on live TV, do prove beyond ANY doubt the missions were fraudulent.<br /><br />2.  Related to 1.  Because NASA decided to use a simple optical trick to make the Earth look far away while actually in orbit (by moving the camera back from the circular window, as Bart proves with uncovered film of the astronauts discussing the illusion), something impossible is recorded for all of  posterity.  This is another, indisputable, smoking gun, and its on NASA's own film reels for all to see.  Bart ingeniously points out their ""round Earth"" is just a view through a ""soda straw"" of the port hole window.  But this method has a major flaw, it takes a small circular portion of the Earth's surface, and presents it as the full diameter.  Back then, we didn't routinely see satellite views of the entire diameter of the Earth, but today, it's commonplace.  We now understand that the largest storms are around 200 miles wide, compared to the Earth's 8,000 mile diameter. Tiny, by comparison.<br /><br />Sure enough, the actual Apollo 11 film footage from this event shows single clouds spanning the entire diameter of the Earth, an absurd image for today's satellite-savvy audience to swallow. Specifically, there is a V shaped cloud that spans the entire planetary diameter. Utterly impossible, and it proves Bart is right, this is a fraud, without any doubt.  Whatsoever.<br /><br />You can see the footage of the astronauts discussing the fake on Bart's links, which he provides in the book.  Better still, you can see the resulting NASA high res film footage of the fake globe with 8,000 mile long clouds by searching:<br /><br />""Apollo 11 - Unscheduled TV - 010:32:36 GET""<br /><br />I could go on, and on, and on, and on, with hundreds more inexcusable errors illuminated by Bart and others.  But just a few more:<br /><br />3. The lack of a blast crater under the Lunar Lander after it fired its 10,000 lb rocket motor directly into the dust caked Moon surface from just a few feet away.  On the Moon, that's almost 2,000 lbs of raw thrust, the same as a supersonic T-38 jet engine, at full power, pointed straight down into dust/regolith, dust that the astronauts later kick around like sand on a beach.  Absurd. Imagine pointing a supersonic jet's engine straight into sand on a beach at point blank range.  Now do it with 5/6ths less gravity, without disturbing a single grain of sand.<br /><br />4. The Lunar Module landing film's lack of communication delay. Search:<br /><br />""Apollo 11 landing from PDI to Touchdown""<br /><br />For a short time, when communications get heated, the time delay between Houston and the Lander, caused by relatively slow radio waves traveling 220,000 miles at the speed of light's tortoise-like 186,000/second, completely disappears.  They talk and respond like they are next door.<br /><br />5. As a former USAF pilot, I know how hard manual aircraft rejoins are, finding, then joining two aircraft in formation.  Its a skill that takes many years to develop and master.  Joining the Lunar module with the Lunar Orbiter, using launch timing from a wind-up wrist watch, at 4000 mph, in the vastness of space, visually, from an entirely unknown launch angle based on how the lander settled, with no horizon reference, no air to brake you, with very limited miniature thrusters, in 1/6th gravity, is BEYOND ridiculous. Six times, without a hitch.  No.<br /><br />6. Better communication clarity than my cell phone, from the Moon.  Sprint has a lot to learn.  NASA was used to corded phone lines, they had no idea how hard it would be to call someone wirelessly, crystal clearly, even on our own planet.<br /><br />And of course...<br /><br />7. SpaceX blowing up hundreds of rockets trying to land on their tail using super computers, high speed GPS tracking, and ring laser gyro stabilization, inputting thousands of computer calculated corrections per second.  Its very hard to do with todays technology.  But Armstrong did it, fully manually, in a totally unfamiliar gravity paradigm... first try.  As did every other Apollo mission.  No.  Sorry.  We know better, now.  SpaceX isn't THAT incompetent (although they have asked for 8 years more time to (re)invent a super simple Lunar Lander).<br /><br />8 through n...  Bart shows the depressing behavior of the post mission astronauts press events, their unanimous inability to remember if they could see stars from the Moon's surface, their complete unfamiliarity with the Van Allen problem, so many photos with major problems, the ability of film to survive +220F, -220F temperatures and the unshielded radiation of space, surviving the hail of 25,000 mph micrometeorites on the Moon's fully unprotected surface, the lack of any bad photos with manual focus-aperture-shutter speed and no viewfinder, orange juice literally squirting through the vacuum of space, puffs of wind waving the flag on the Moon as an astronaut runs a bit too close, visible oil leaks from the rover's wheel hubs in a vacuum, and Moonscapes that can now be overlayed, using modern tools like Photoshop, to reveal the base photos were reused across different Apollo missions' landing sites.<br /><br />In the bitter end, it's not hard to conclude the missions weren't real, sadly, the opposite is true.<br /><br />So, THANK YOU, Bart Sibrel, for exposing the worst lie in human history.  It takes incredible moral strength, and thanks to you, we now understand what our government is capable of.  The only question remaining in my mind is... was it a well intentioned lie, or a petty heist of $150 billion dollars.  I wonder what the original outspoken skeptics: Grissom, White, and Chaffee, would say?",5.0,1,2021
TRIGGER WARNING: CONSTANT ANIMAL SUFFERING AND DEATH,"Kristin Hannah novels are so hit and miss for me.<br /><br />For instance, I absolutely loved Night Road...it's probably one of my all-time favorite books. Yet, I really hated the The Nightingale.<br /><br />And here's why...<br /><br />Every time I read Hannah's historical fiction, I end up feeling as though she researches like a mad woman, jots down every tragedy she can find during that time period, and then destroys her main character by making her suffer through every. single. calamity.<br /><br />It's too much.<br /><br />This book was so horribly depressing, and was so full of misery and death (animals included...it's bad, friends), that I couldn't wait for it to end. There was zero enjoyment while reading this. Yes, it's well-written, and yes, Ms. Hannah knows how to ratchet up the tension...but man, balance is a good thing. The constant darkness is overwhelming.<br /><br />The conclusion was completely predictable and emotionally manipulative. I know I was supposed to break down into devastated tears, but instead, I let out a huge sigh and rolled my eyes. Does that count? I think I just need to stick to her contemporary books and skip the historical options.<br /><br />I'm once again in the minority here, so read it...you know you want to.<br /><br />TRIGGER WARNING: CONSTANT ANIMAL SUFFERING AND DEATH<br /><br />2.5 stars<br />Available February 2, 2021<br /><br />Despite my less than enthusiastic review, I'd like to thank NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for my review copy.",2.0,0,2021
Remarkably Written,"This book was worth the slow agonizing wait - Agonizing because the characters are so vividly written, it is impossible not to bond with each one of them and love them.<br /><br />Much like the first book, the second focuses mainly on the relationships between each member, while the story is lost to all the emotional and ups and downs between the members of the pack. Normally, it would be a bad thing, but somehow E. Woods manages to make it feel authentic, despite the repetition in their feelings. After all, people don’t just miraculously overcome trauma in their lives with one soothing moment. Such things takes times, which only lends to the authenticity of each character - allowing for a sense of humanity and realness lost in a lot of books trying to make characters “badass.”<br /><br />My main concern is that there still leaves a LOT of ground to cover, story-wise, for the final book. If it takes 700 pages to cover three to four days, I worry the pacing of the final book will feel incredibly rushed. That, or it will end up being 1000+ pages long.. which I actually would not mind.<br /><br />Despite the slow pace - and my concerns for the final book - this is still highly recommended. It has set the bar for many of the Kindle Unlimited books, soaring above the competition, landing firmly in place with many of the famous paid book series, including Kate Daniels, Mercy Thompson, and even Kushiel’s Dart. With the author’s amazing ability to depict each emotion in detail, allowing the reading to feel the pain and laughter with the characters, this book will leave you emotionally connected with all the characters, even the ones you wouldn’t normally mesh with. Despite the 700 page length, it will go by in a blur as you greedily digest the emotions of each character. Masterfully done.<br /><br />Can’t wait for the third already.",5.0,1,2021
"Engaging, Quick, Easy Reading Memoir of Life in Bolivia’s Amazon","This is a very easy raptor read memoir giving us an insight into 21$t Century Bolivia and, of course, into a British woman’s relationship with a New World cat.<br /><br />I was at once drawn into her story, in part by her self-deprecating humor (or should I use the word humor?) and by her choice of short words, in lieu of hifalutin prose.<br /><br />LANGUAGE: If adult language disturbs you, though, you may want to look for another story this month. As. For me, I wasn’t especially bothered by the “F” words, but I have come to understand that the frequent use of such a word by Brits is not uncommon. Still, the overuse of .the word in this otherwise fun exploration did detract just a bit of the fun.<br /><br />Overall, this is a four star read.",4.0,1,2021
Very Disappointing,"I have read every Jack Reacher novel that Lee Child has written, and while I'm only half way through this new novel, the writing quality just isn't the same. This is clearly an Andrew Child novel, regardless of the names on the cover. I'm going to stick with it, and maintain hope that Andrew will find his writing groove.<br /><br />Update: Finished the book. Changing two stars to one star. I'm finished with this series (which I have loved, when Lee Child was writing), until such time that the overall reviews suggest things have improved. The writing in this book lacked all of the brilliance in the previous, Lee Child authored novels.",1.0,0,2021
Glad I didn’t wait 7 years! **Major Spoilers**,"Where do I begin‽ I’m glad I didn’t wait 7 years for this book, I only had to wait 2. The joy I felt at the end of MOBY when everyone is finally reunited is so quickly taken away when DG splits everyone up.<br /><br />I really didn’t see the point of Ian HAVING to go see Emily, I understand that he was worried but to travel such a far distance during a war didn’t seem wise. It felt like the only reason was so Ian could have his son. While I’m happy for him, it really didn’t add much to the plot of the book. Did DG just want Jenny to find a new love interest?<br /><br />The whole Fergus and Percy talk was a bit of a let down. That story has been building for two books and nothing really comes of it.<br /><br />I did really like that William and Brianna got to spend time together though. That was one of my favorite things from the book. William has grown on me as he has matured. I really can’t blame him for being upset about Jamie being his father, everything he thought he knew in life was a lie essentially.<br /><br />I’m not sure I want William and Amaranthus together, it seemed too obvious. I didn’t mind Ben being alive and a turncoat, that was kind of interesting. I was sad we really didn’t get to see much of Dottie or Denzell though. I really like the Hunter’s.<br /><br />In keeping with a trend SO much happens in the last 20% of the book. Things really took a turn for me. I was ok with stuff for the most part, even if it felt a bit disjointed. Ulysses showing up on the Ridge was just too much for me. I know DG likes to have all her characters meet up again, and I can generally look past the implausibility of it but this pushed it.<br /><br />There were a number if things that didn’t match up in regards to Ulysses and the previous books. Claire says she hasn’t seen Ulysses since River Run, but that’s not true. Ulysses was with Jocasta and Duncan when they came to Fraser’s Ridge in ABOSAA on their way to Canada. Then it seemed to imply that Ulysses killed Hector Cameron and Dr. Rawlings‽ In DoA John Quincy Myers tells Jamie Hector Cameron died of the morbid sore throat. And I thought it was Hector who killed Dr. Rawlings?<br /><br />I think DG did a huge disservice to us by telling everyone Jamie doesn’t die in this book. It took away any worry from the battle. I knew Claire would just heal him with her blue light powers. It would have been more impactful if we really thought Jamie was dying/dead.<br /><br />Lastly you have Ezekiel Richardson turning out to be a fellow time traveler who wants the British to win the war. I really didn’t like that at all, it felt forced and didn’t flow. So Richardson was trying to get the gold in the 20th century but now he just wants the Americans to lose the war? Is the gold no longer a concern?<br /><br />So overall I think I am disappointed by Bees. I don’t know if my expectations were too high? I can’t say what I thought the book would be, but it wasn’t really this. I like everyone being together and that just didn’t happen very much.<br /><br />Edit: I forgot to add the part about Silvia's husband happening to be in the exact same place in New York as her!! What are the odds of that when he was kidnapped by a different Native American tribe in Pennsylvania‽ That just made me roll my eyes. I did like Silvia though and was happy she came to the Ridge.",2.0,0,2021
Disappointing,"I used to be such a fan of this series and Anita. What I loved was her kickass attitude and all the paranormal aspects. Today I gave up trying to read this book and am very sorry to say I won’t be buying any more. According to my kindle app I’m 39% through the book.  Haven’t seen hide nor hair of a plot.  Just ENDLESS descriptions and discussions of all her relationships. 39% of the book of her and Rafael and others discussing sex and nothing much else.  I’m just tired of it. I don’t object to her sexual preferences, but the books have become all about that and almost nothing about a plot or anything outside of her more than ridiculous number of sexual partners. Somebody give me a heads up if she ever gets back to her job. I’ll be happy to try again.",1.0,0,2021
The rise of a Reagan Republican--and the demise of his GOP,"Boehner may be wealthy and well-connected now, but he’s got a no-frills narrative style that reflects his working class roots. This is a good thing, making “On the House” an easy and fairly gossipy, fairly enjoyable read.  Starting with the cover photo, merlot in hand, he reminds you of the local head of the Chamber of Commerce who's good enough with people that he winds up in Washington as the second in line to the president.<br /><br />Boehner's negativity toward some of the most influential Democrats (Pelosi and Obama foremost among them) could be expected, because he has no feeling for Democrats’ causes (see how he writes about Obamacare, e.g.)  He came from a working class Democratic family but admits he became a Reagan Republican (just like Reagan became a Republican) because he’d worked his way up from a salesman in a small plastics company to the company president and didn’t like the government taking so much of his money in taxes. (One of the surprises of this book for me was how interesting his childhood was--growing up as one of 12 children—in a house where girls had one bedroom; boys had the other and the parents slept on the couch. He spent Saturdays with his eldest brother—both kids—working in their father’s local bar. Whatever one thinks of Boehner's politics, coming from those humble beginnings to being elected 13 times to represent Ohio’s 8th district in Congress--and holding a variety of leadership positions, including Speaker--is pretty impressive.<br /><br />Of course most of the book is about his experiences in Congress. He compares Bill Clinton to Eddie Haskell, loved Ted Kennedy--includes a good GWB story about the three of them working together on No Child Left Behind--was friends with Gerald Ford, and got along great with Biden. He helped the Freedom Caucus get elected, then watched them turn on him. Jim Jordan represents the worst of them, in his opinion, a grandstander and naysayer who never wants to get anything actually done.  Boehner –really- hates Ted Cruz—another Freedom Caucus-type, obructionist and self-promoter without peer.  He calls Cruz “Lucifer in the flesh” and, apparently in the audiobook version directs some profanity at him that you can’t put in print editions.)<br /><br />A lot of his early years in Congress may not be of great interest to people who weren’t around during the Clinton years (Boehner admits that the impeachment was a mistake, done just to try to win a majority in the House).  He tells of an early encounter with Trump—golfing together—where Boehner observes his infamous temper. (He also notes that he never once thought “this man will be president one day”.)  Some commentators have criticized him for helping to elect the Tea Party and Freedom Caucus that led to MAGA.  But Boehner did try to get things done for Republicans. He may have inadvertently contributed to the rise of what he calls “Crazytown”, but at least he doesn’t endorse it.<br /><br />In fact, he repudiates Trump and Trumpism, writing of the events of Jan 6th: “ Trump incited that bloody insurrection for nothing more than selfish reasons, perpetuated by the (b....) he’d been shoveling since he lost a fair election the previous November.  He claimed voter fraud without any evidence...taking advantage of the trust placed in him by his supporters and ultimately betraying that trust....some of the (House and Senate) people involved did not surprise me in the least. The legislative terrorism that I’d witnessed as Speaker had now encouraged actual terrorism.”<br /><br />Boehner’s rise through traditional Republican politics (like Ford and Reagan before him)—now makes them all seem like relics of the past, part of a party that is no longer identifiable. Boehner says neither he nor Reagan would be elected today. (His comments about the role of Roger Ailes and Fox News are also very telling.) He’s not about offering solutions or predictions, but the transformation of the GOP that forms the backdrop for his career--and its future--is definitely something Americans across party lines should be thinking about.",4.0,1,2021
Ironic: A Book About Communication That Is Poorly Written,"This author has a nice idea.  It was interesting.  He could have expressed it in a pamphlet.  However, he crammed 5 minutes of information into a two hour read.  Very poorly written.  Verbose and overzealous in tone.",1.0,0,2021
SHHHH - Take Care To Not Waken the Singer....,"I’m working graveyard shift for a small resort/hotel, so I got an early start today with this novel.<br /><br />Although I have studied the techniques of writing fantasy as taught by Michael Stackpole, I am no expert on the craft, so take that into advisement while perusing my thoughts on “Song of the Forever Rains.”<br /><br />World building does not commence early in this story. Instead, the author launches into a far-fetched tale of three girls exploring forbidden areas in the mischievous way that only the innocent youths can. Scene descriptions of their antics are so well done and such fast reading that I simply could not put the book down.<br /><br />In short, I loved the book.<br /><br />LANGUAGE: Clean language.<br /><br />Although there clearly is more story coming, I would not call the ending a cliffhanger.<br /><br />How much did I enjoy this fantasy?

Different for Jennifer Weiner - Disappointing Political Position,"I am a big Jennifer Weiner fan.  I have read every one of her books.  I enjoy her characters, relationships and humor.  However this book's is humorless as the topic does not lend itself to Ms. Weiner usual humor.  Having said that I enjoyed the characters and plot development and twists.  The story is ripe and topical for the #metoo movement but gravely misrepresents the Brett Kavanaugh allegations and Senate Judiciary Supplemental hearings.  It was extremely disappointing to have political posturing in a fiction setting.  It definitely distracted from the tragic and serious topic.",3.0,0,2021
While I love Gabriel Allon........,"I have read each and every Daniel Silva book and wait impatiently for each July to come so I can get the next installment.  This year was no different.  I was not at all disappointed by my favorite spy and team.  Silva writes them with such incredible realism that I can  think of them as people that I would like to know and have as friends.<br /><br />This year's chapter left me heartbroken, upset and just plain angry.  I am tired of celebrities of all stripes inserting their political views into their particular medium.......sports, entertainment and now my favorite author and subject.  When I watch a sporting event, an actor/actress, or read a book, I do not want to be distracted by outside issues.  I want to be immersed in the scene before me without the outside world impinging on my senses.  It took all that I had in me to finish The Cellist.  I understand that we, the people, have different views and ideas.  I have no issue with that.  The issue is that when I am spending my money to be entertained, I do not want the entertainer to offer me his/her political views.  I am not coming to you for political commentary.<br /><br />I am not so sure that I will be waiting with anticipation for next year's chapter of Gabriel Allon's story.  That saddens me immensely.",1.0,0,2021
hyper-caffeinated narration around the same points...,"Readers of Holiday's previous books will instantly recognize the narrative style - hyper-caffeinated, short chapters that seem to keep repeating the same points,  sprinkled with a curated set of quotes from various Stoic/eastern philosophy sources - all served with a generous tone of cheerleading.  If you are a fan of that style, this book will not disappoint - can be a good companion of his book on obstacles.  For those who will not enjoy pages and pages of the same tone, this will be a test of patience.<br /><br />There are gems of observations scattered in a few chapters.  A few thought frames that can be used to start facing a ""fear"" are mentioned, but not necessarily in a easy-to-categorize and absorb manner. The book itself is organized into three parts - Fear, Courage and Heroism.  Roughly, the emphasis of each segment is (at least how I felt useful to go through the book) - why we are fearful or lack courage,  how to create the first moves/momentum to build courage, and what can sustain and build.  Instead of trying to formulate a somewhat linear narrative of causes-diagnosis-treatments-management,  the reader is left to own devices to develop a thought framework of one's own.<br /><br />Perhaps, the most original and useful section of the book is the discussion of his own experience at American Apparel (it is all the way at the end at ""Afterword"").  The self-appraisals and observations based on his experience there captures his views on courage very well - this chapter should have been the introduction, not the Afterword.  That could potentially have set up the book much better.<br /><br />Having read all his books and continue to enjoy his weekly reading lists, the last two books (this one and Life of Stoics) have been underwhelming.  I wish he expands on his American Apparel experience and use that as a foil to narrate almost all the themes from his books on ego, obstacles, and courage.  Even with some poetic licenses, that will be a good book.  This one, will engage and entertain you for a bit, but the constant haranguing of finding the courage gives the book the tone of a cliched motivation speaker.",3.0,0,2021

Rather More Grim than Author 's Prior Trilogies,"While this book, was as riveting as all his other novels, it was yet difficult to truly “enjoy;” even as brilliantly written as this is. John Gynne is a remarkable & gifted writer;  he has become my favorite author & I leapt into this with excitement. This is a heavy tale though & as I read, the story itself was dark & daunting. Perhaps the pandemic unfolding made this tale feel that much more grim, sometimes even depressing. This is a tale filled with unsparing loss & sorrow. I kept looking, with some desperation, for any thread, any reason, to believe we might reach a place of inspiration, hope, or redemption.  We, all & each one, read for different reasons. For me, now an old woman, I know well I long for kinder, heroic fantasy. Do not get attached to any character; this tale is not afraid to shed characters. At times, the story evoked relentless desolation. The 3 characters maintain an unknowing distance from one another. Each chapter presents one of their 3 POV's. I began to suspect the 3 characters were kept alive only to move the plots along. Many readers enjoy such a creative leap/lurch from view to view to view as each chapter not only moves always to a different character, but as well a different world as each of the 3 character inhabits a life, a journey, & a place . not seen by the other main characters. I admire your patience if your taste runs so; I was already gloomy at the various plot outcomes & wearied as the separate tales of the 3 maIn characters seemed somehow hollow. It seemed another loss; to endure these three operating in worlds ignorant of the others' existence. Also, the three tales bounce between long, passive descriptions, then abruptly jump into gore, savagery, & death. Perhaps reading straight thru in one night ( yes, a tribute to Mr. Gwynne skills), left me a bit broken myself as I made my way to the end. We meet the leads, Orka, then Varg, and Elgar without any of their respective backstories. We stumble through hints of each one’s past.  Their secret wounds, their motivations, fears, & dreams, are cryptic. While no one enjoys reading through a long backstory narrative, Shadow of the Gods hides so much, it becomes frustrating.<br />A minor point next but also distracting is the endless use of the term “Thought Cage” as the only word choice for thinking, mind, or one’s brain. As if every disparate character, alive in 3 unique places-settings not seen by the other characters…yet apparently all have learned only this solitary term- reading, rereading the expression “Thought Cage” began to make me flinch. It lifted me out of the tale as I muttered “Really? Again? Has no one, in all of the worlds we read through, tried another term to express the brain, thinking, etc? Will we be hammered with “Thought-Cage through each book in this series?” The English language, I learned, leaned heavily on old Nordic or Viking language. So many similarities between these languages.  I was surprised to discover for myself how very many words connect; Viking/ Nordic to the younger English terms such as traust- trust, oddi-odd, Porsdagr/ Thor’sDay- Thursday. Knifr - knife, etc. In the worlds of our 3 main characters, however, we have are granted only one reference to represent  thinking, pondering, brain, or mind. ALWAYS referenced ONLY AS “Thought Cage.” Trivial? Yup, label this whining but the endless repeats of “Thought Cage” yanked me out of the tale time & again.<br />The story starts grimly & the tone remains steadfastly dour & grievous. After the sorrowful end of the final book in Mr. Gwynne’s series ""Of Blood and Bone,"" (A Time of Blood,) I found myself on guard within the first few pages of ""Shadow of the Gods."" That anxiety proved appropriate. The despair and losses in this book may foretell the pattern of this new series. Maybe not. John Gwynne is an astonishing storyteller, but he has also shown no hesitation to bring grief once again. In this book now, we see hope burn into despair. This author is unafraid to snatch away gladness; frequently choosing grief & betrayal for characters I had begun to love. Perhaps my jumpiness will be unwarranted in what is to come but the author's willingness to end A Time of Blood in such a mournful way, had me leery as I now read this violent tale. Mr. Gwynne is the author & of course he gets to tell the tale. I am just a fretful old woman with yet endless admiration for this writer. Even when we become attached only to lose another fictional soul to tragedy and death.  He needn't cater to Happy Ending freaks like me. I just prefer books I can read again & again; such is his talent. Alas, that means only his first trilogy, ""The Faithful and the Fallen"" is enjoyable a second & third time. I will, of course gratefully read on in this newest series. I strongly encourage you to read this newest series; apologies if you too suddenly become gloomy. Hoping against hope his storyline might conclude with less wreckage & betrayal. Other readers, more hearty than myself, will manage fictional calamity and chuckle at someone who becomes bereaved over an imaginary character. I find myself believing the characters & becoming invested in the characters Mr. Gwynne animates so profoundly.. You may be partial to lots of battle scenes (then you are in luck!) & less dependent on how it all plays out. He favors realism, logic, motivation; his values are there in every one of his plots. He clearly avoids the Happy Ever After Club; my personal club membership too trivial to even scoff over.  I highly recommend this book, well worth the anguish & pain. We fans of Mr. Gynne know to support one another as we go!",4.0,1,2021
Chastised for a decade of unreadable drivel Stephenson lives up to the promise of his earlier work,"The best and brightest of the author's fans have been ground down to a few hardy older ones with good memories.  Repeatedly his recent work has not done justice to that talent.  Finally some of the multitude of literate, well written reviews by disappointed fans must have penetrated Stephensons protective shell because in Termination Shock he finally puts out a book worth reading.  He appears to have put aside  whatever it was in the past that has come across as the self serving and indulgent ramblings of an ego out of control and instead serves up a good story, wrapping the reader in his plausible near future world so seamlessly that time spent reading seems to enter that mildly time dilated state that only the best writing from the best talent can approach. Can he do it two times in a row?  The talent is there.",4.0,1,2021
Changed my mind and got it,"It's November and I've already read so many books about Trump, including the top three about the election--Woodward/Costa; Rucker/Leonig and Bender.  I had no plans to read one by Jonathan Karl, who, as ABC White House correspondent, I never thought of as a writer. How could Karl's book possibly hold up against those by the Washington Post's and New York Times' reporters? Didn't I already know about Trump's final power grab in exhaustive detail?<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, I read the excerpt of ""Betrayal"" here.  It was different. It organized the extensive information a bit differently, was clearly written and the narrative zipped along. I got it after all, and am glad that I did. I wasn't even distracted by Karl periodically reminding us that he was there, asking a question at a press conference, or being called at 1 a.m. to get to Walter Reed before Trump--recently diagnosed with coronavirus--arrived.  Actually, to my surprise, Karl's involvement as a reporter added to the momentum of it all.<br /><br />I feel I know a considerable amount about Trump's last year--his mismanagement of the pandemic, his chaotic leadership style, his obsession with reelection. But Karl added in things I didn't know--and asks some of the questions I had that are unanswered (like:  When did Trump get diagnosed with covid? Did he know he was ill when he was at the debate with Biden, exposing Biden and others in the building? Did he, on the honor system, take the required covid test?  Trump and his team wouldn't answer these questions for Karl--at least not on the record--but at least he asked them.  The answers would go to Trump's character and I think the answers--in being dodged--are pretty clear, even if Democrats, as usual, missed  nearly every opportunity on attack.)<br /><br />I really like how he writes, how he brings the publicly known details together, and how he gets most of his sources to go on the record.  Even after reading several books about Trump's last year, this filled in some details I didn't know and pulled a picture together that was less .. cluttered ... with minor information than some of the others I've read. To my surprise, he also wasn't afraid to say the truth about what Trump was doing and how he genuinely threatened democracy--and was barely stopped, according to Karl, by his own incompetence and the actions of others, both known to the public and unknown. Scary stuff, and we aren't talking about it--and thinking about it--nearly enough.<br /><br />(My main criticism, as with other books on this, is the general absence of Democrats. If not for Democrats standing firmly against Trump's corruption, would the handful of courageous Republicans have stood up? Would their efforts have made any difference without Democrats, including Biden, Pelosi, impeachment team, et al?  As with other books, there is little about his critics and the important things they say/do, including impeachment and the trial.)<br /><br />Post-loss on Nov 7, Trump sets up the Giuliani team v. others in an interesting way and how it's Trump who empowers the ""crazies"" -- because they're the ones telling him what he wants to hear.  I found Lewandowski's comment interesting:  that Trump knew he lost but wanted to lie about it anyway so that he could delegtimize Biden's victory (and, fyi, his presidency) and still say he was the real winner--cheated out of victory--when he left office.<br /><br />Karl doesn't spend much time speculating about the character--or mental health--of a president who would do that.  But the events described, organized, and attributed, make this a book that future historians will find helpful as they lay out the answer. There's even some humor (as in the description of Christopher Miller, later to become acting Sec of Defense, trying to find his way out of the Oval Office on his first visit).  I actually found this, in the writing, the most interesting of all the Trump election books. Surprisingly, even when you know the ending, it's a real page turner.",5.0,1,2021

"Great Premise, Intriguing Prologue, But, Then, Alas, I Started Reading...","Since this is my first review in quite some time, (January 6), I want to explain what I experienced in reading “Wings of Fury.” It is because of this experience that I even decided to post a review. Otherwise, I would not even bothered doing so, as I have too many irons in the fire AND I recently have made two trips to ER at my local hospital.<br /><br />I trust some readers will understand my decision to sharply curtail my involvement with Amazon Customer Reviews...<br /><br />The premise, and its potential, grabbed my attention. Having just finished my Audible book, “Great Courses, From Jesus to Constantine,” I learned a bit about the pagan gods, as well as the early Christian church. At any rate, my desire for more ancient history, woven into fantasy, was so stimulated I jumped at the chance to read “Wings of Fury.”<br /><br />Then, alas, I raced through the prologue and beyond. The below excerpts demonstrate some points as to why I state, “Alas.”<br /><br />One point: As Bart Ehrman notes, the gods of the Greek and Romans were many, and no one among them was ‘The almighty.’ Still, if that were the only error, I would dismiss it and rate the book five stars, for I believe the author should be granted poetic license.<br /><br />However, my second point: throughout the prologue and early pages, the writing comes across as that of a teenager. (Yes, I know the story is supposed to be from the perspective of a youngster, but the writing should not be...)<br /><br />Excerpts:<br /><br />Pg 3 ‘ “The general pushed her into the line of vestals behind her and drew his sword. “Speak the truth, woman. We come in the name of the Almighty, the God of Gods.” ‘<br /><br />Also on Pg 3 ‘ “ This is Gaea’s house,” Mother said. “My family has sought sanctuary with the Mother of All Gods.” ‘<br /><br />Pg 4 ‘ “My blade grazed his right forearm. He sucked in a cavernous breath, drinking in the whole night sky. Matron Prosymna ran forward to grab me, but Decimus moved faster, and he struck me so hard, I flew into the statue of Gaea and tumbled to her feet.’<br /><br />And, same page ‘“Has another man spoken for her?” he enunciated impatiently.’ [enunciated.]<br /><br />Pg 22 “Our former home, the city of Othrys, kneeled at the feet of the mountain peak, strewn around its fringes in the stony foothills. I...” [kneeled at the feet of the mountain peak?]<br /><br />By this time, I nearly gave up and went on to read something else.<br /><br />However, the writing does greatly improve, and is, mostly, free of cussing and street talk, and, further, the suspense is tightly written and intriguing enough for me to rate four stars. However, I do expect other reviewers who actually read “Wings of Fury” to be harsher than I.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Four stars out of five.",4.0,1,2021
Everyone would benefit from reading this book,"This is the third book I’ve read by Ryuu Shinohara and I continue to gain insight from his work. While the first books I read were more of an introduction to the concept of manifesting and why it works, for me this book seemed to deal with the concept at more of an advanced level. It went into more detail about how to actually change not only your thoughts but the way you view the world. Thankfully, for me, it wasn’t all about writing down every day what you want and what you’re grateful for. That may be appealing for some but it does not appeal to me. This book was more of a how to, something I do in my own mind without having to write it down. Sort of mental exercising. It’s one thing for someone to say “well you just have to align with what you want, vibrate at the same frequency of what you want,” etc. But if you really think about it, how does one do that? Well this book explains how one does that and, true to the author’s style, he explains it very well in a relaxed way with what I only know how to describe as a calm, quiet wisdom.<br /><br />This book offers techniques that help you to change the way you think about the world around you and situations you find yourself in, both large and small. When you’re able to view your life in a different way, to think about things that happen in a different way, you’re better able to manifest the reality that you want.<br /><br />I suspect this is one of those books that, even though multiple people will be reading the same words, each person will get something different from those words. I feel completely confident when I say that everyone who reads it will benefit from it.",5.0,1,2021
Christie uses his intelligence to repeatedly make dishonest points,"Christie's smarter than Trump, obviously more focused and articulate. But fortunately for the country, he lacks Trump's level of charisma. This book seems like the launch of his 2024 presidential campaign, but it doesn't have the compelling message he hopes.  He'll lose Trump and his supporters with his attacks on the far right, and turn off Democrats with the ""radical socialist"" claims.  A lot of Independents will read this and, rightly, won't trust him.<br /><br />Christie's combination of half truths and outright lies is harder to see through than Trump's constant  barrage of falsehoods. He leaves out important details so that readers won't make conclusions that contradict his rosy picture. For example, the whole ""We all got covid around Trump"" story.  He clearly got the disease at Trump's maskless debate prep and/or the maskless party for Coney-Barrett.  So did dozens of other guests and those who worked in the White House.<br /><br />Christie dances around Trump's responsibility to these people. He also doesn't criticize Trump's responsibility to millions around the COUNTRY who got sick or because of being maskless. Hundreds of thousands died because wearing masks looks ""weak"" to Donald Trump and so he wouldn't listen to public health experts.  After getting covid, Christie gave the message, ""wear a mask"" but it was hardly enough. (He says absolutely nothing about the likelihood Trump didn't follow the rules to take a covid test pre-Cleveland debate--when he was probably already infected--and put dozens of people's lives at risk that night as a result of his selfishness.)<br /><br />Over time, Christie's omissions make you start routinely asking, ""Well, what's he probably leaving out HERE?""  He uses the ""I'm going to seem honest by criticizing things that other Republicans won't"" technique, but then hopes you just accept his false statements about Democrats without giving any evidence in support of them. (For example, Joe Biden does -not- have an ""open border policy"".)<br /><br />There are so many things that he writes in this book that are not honest.  Yet through it all, he keeps gaslighting us with the idea that Republicans are the ones to look to for truth--if they ""just"" break free of the Jones' and QAnons and Gosars and Greens and McCarthys and Trumps (i.e. today's GOP).  Like Trump, Christie lies while boasting about being the representative of truth.<br /><br />Christie's insists that Democrats, including Joe Biden, are some kind of radical leftist socialists, and that Americans need to vote Republican to save ""freedom and capitalism"" from them.  His theme of ""Fear Democratic Radicals!"" is so out of touch with reality --and is surprisingly Trumpian in its presentation. He's much smarter and better informed than Trump, with the obvious ability to separate fact from fiction if he wants to. Christie's williness to lie to voters for political advantage--and to sound smart and articulate doing it--makes him even more dangerous than Trump.<br /><br />For example, Christie talks about the nation's teachers' unions ""surrendering every classroom to radical teachers to teach critical race theory"".  How ridiculous is that? Anyone who's really paying attention (as I assume Christie is) knows that CRT is -not- being taught in public schools.<br /><br />Then again, what would you expect from a former governor who's still proud of trying to balance his budget by freezing teachers' pay for a year and making them pay more for health care?  Christie lets Trump push him around--even defers when Trump orders food Christie doesn't want for him to eat--but he's got his own inner bully, too, and we can see it here.<br /><br />(How could anyone read his sanctimonious criticism of ""Pizzagate"" and see him discrediting QAnon's lies about Hillary Clinton, without also remembering Christie ""prosecuting"" her to chants of ""Lock her up!"" at the RNConvention in 2016?  Unlike -his- candidate, she'd never been charged with any crime. And still hasn't.)<br /><br />Republicans -aren't- the party of fiscal responsibility any more than they are the party of truth and integrity. (That was funny, his praise for the GOP historically.  The reality was that Reagan's 8 years led to (1) bigger government; and (2) huge deficits.  GW Bush inherited a $600 billion SURPLUS from Bill Clinton--and then squandered it, including spending $12 billion/month on an irrational war in Iraq, and wrecking the economy. Trump?  He added $2 trillion to the deficit.<br /><br />If you want fiscal responsibility--plus programs that actually help people get health care, child care, clean air/water etc--vote Democratic. They're always coming in to clean up Republicans' financial messes and trying to make life better for most Americans, not catering to the well-being of billionaires and corporations.  Republicans predictably keep giving tax cuts to the rich and cutting regulations that protect workers and the environment. I guess that's what Christie means when he keeps praising the GOP for ""saving"" capitalism.<br /><br />Nicolle Wallace made an excellent point this week when she interviewed Christie. She asked why, in his desire for ""facts and honesty"" doesn't he ever look at the lies and propaganda spewed on Fox every night? Yes, he points out Trump that legitimately lost. Yes, he takes on the ""dangers"" of Alex Jones and QAnon.  But he gives rightwing cable media a total pass for -their- dangerous lies. As he told Wallace re: Tucker Carlson, ""I don't watch.""  Really? When you're trying to save the GOP by making them the party of ""truth""?  He even tried a false counter-attack that she was ""conflating"" different parts of his book--a truly pathetic attempt at deflection. He's Donald Trump with a law degree.<br /><br />Think about all the facts about Republicans and Democrats that Christie's leaving out when you read this book. His omissions are essential to his claims about both and show what his ""rescue"" plan is really about.",2.0,0,2021

A tough bunch of questions,"This book gives insight to a series of perplexing questions: Why do the so-called progressives (What are they progressing toward? Anarchy? Destruction of society?)put up with, support, or condone the anti social behavior of the left? Why do they advocate selective enforcement of the law? Drugs are illegal. Sleeping on the street is illegal. Defecating and urinating on the street is illegal. Why aren’t these laws enforced?<br /><br />The short answer is in the name of “freedom” certain psychotic and drug addicted people are allowed to make life miserable for the rest of the city dwellers. It is thought unacceptable to curtail the freedom of the many mentally-challenged and hard drug-addicted homeless people.<br /><br />We get what we allow.",5.0,1,2021
Not Worth the Hype,"I know I’m in the minority here, but I have to write this review.  I rarely write them except I finished the book a few days ago and it’s nagging on my mind to express how utterly disappointed I am with this book.  This is my first time reading this author’s work and I only did because I am a history addict.  The hype pulled me in as well, darn it!  I’ll be brief.  The characters were so dull and one dimensional that I thought I would lose my mind trying to discover even the smallest evidence of something more from each one.  Yes, even the long suffering Elsa was painfully dull.  The author used repetition unceasingly; did you know there are tumbleweeds in Texas?  The only reason for adding an extra star is because I learned a handful of interesting facts about the Dust Bowl.  I’m not even going to really complain about the ending because it was predictable and I was so glad to be done with the book.  I felt cheated and robbed of my $14.99 when I finished the last sentence.",2.0,0,2021
Naive or brave? You be the judge.,"Being completely new to this author, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I got more than I bargained for. She holds nothing back. Literally. I've read books that claim to be open but she blew the door off privacy and secrets and cast out all of those things that we all think onto paper and called it a book. She shies away from nothing!<br /><br />I appreciate the level of snark and sarcasm. It's sprinkled thoughout and like finishing salt on a steak, it makes it far tastier.<br /><br />Her descriptions did become a bit monotonous especially in regards to her ambiguous feelings about her own sexuality. I am a straight, white, middle aged woman so what do I know about being a lesbian? But it got old.<br /><br />She tells her story in a very linear fashion. You get a complete story up to her current status but there are certain things that I felt we got too much of and others that she gave us only a nibble. Her college years felt like they droned on but her battles with OCD (something I deal with) are almost gloseed over. Sure she mentions them and talks about her need to do things to prevent bad things from happening but for me, it felt shortchanged. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />There are aspects of the book that are universal to the human experience. I can certainly commiserate with her feelings when they would be transferred and she had barely made friends. I wasn't an army brat. We moved more often than that.<br /><br />I am also Southern (yes with a capital S) so I get the accent and that football is life and MRS degrees far too well. But she goes further by putting her sexual history on full display. She's either incredibly brave or naive about how it will be received. She even owns up to exactly how many male sexual partners she's had and is very forthcoming about her same sex encounters. If that bothers you, move on.<br /><br />I only found one very minor typo. It's technically almost flawless. The chapter headings and her footnotes gave me a few giggles. (On the Kindle edition, you can touch the highlighted numbers in the body of the text and it will take you straight to the footnote and then touch it to return back to the book. Just in case you didn't know.)<br /><br />Overall, the book is eye opening to the sexual experience for at least one Southern lesbian.  I didn't laugh out loud or highlight things to share with friends. The best I can do is 4 stars.",4.0,1,2021
I wanted to like it but I can't.,"SPOILERS ahead:<br /><br />I bought the kindle version the same day after seeing the trailer for M Night Shyamalan's upcoming movie (it was a captivating trailer, I guess). Wish I had just waited a few months to watch the movie. The movie will last longer!<br /><br />The concept of rapid aging is intriguing. It's a smart way of getting people to pay to read/watch your work. Because of that I couldn't put my phone down. Read it cover to cover in about 60 minutes.<br /><br />That said, I really hate the idea that I spent a little over $15 for something that's over in an hour! You don't even get the satisfaction of an explanation, which is the only reason most people will buy the book to begin with.<br /><br />It's not explained what killed the young lady that was skinny dipping- it wasn't old age like the rest.<br /><br />It's not explained why the writer and his family could enter the cove later than the other families but the police (that they were waiting on) couldn't. What's happening in the outside world at this time?<br /><br />Obviously, the rapid aging wasn't explained. Very frustrating.<br /><br />According to the grown up 3-year old, someone was watching them through binoculars in the distance, no explanation.<br /><br />Someone was shooting at a secondary character, then the unseen shooter and secondary character disappeared. Again, no answers.<br /><br />The water seems to take life (skinny dipping lady; couple committing suicide by simply walking into the sea with no weights), but with no discernible pattern. Everybody else swam and were in and out of the water, yet those three didn't last 10 seconds. Don't bother waiting for an explanation on that one either.<br /><br />In my opinion, it is a very CHEAP way of writing. To offer amazing concepts, to captivate an audience, then don't deliver at the end but charge them for the pleasure.<br /><br />Also, a warning: there's child nudity. That's going to create some cultural barriers. I admit it made me uncomfortable, and will make most non-europeans uncomfortable.<br /><br />What did I like? The message of the book: Live life now. Don't worry about death, don't worry about future time. The time is now. It's a great reminder of what we all intrinsically know but often forget. Not worth the money though, nothing is answered. It's cheaper... FREE... to look up a quote about life on Google, than spend $15-$18 buying this kindle edition/book.",2.0,0,2021

Disappointing,"The writing is not good, continuity problems are consistent, and the plot wobbles all over the place.  Chatfield's strengths from the earlier books - creativity and individualized character-are mostly absent.<br /><br />Here's a sample of nonsensical writing:<br />""Like a planet forming from the dust of space, the core compressed from a softball to a grapefruit and smaller""<br /><br />This does not make any sense.  It describes an accretion disc.  Then it describes *shrinking* from a softball (2.5 inches in diameter) to a grapefruit (4-6 inches in diameter) and caps it off with a clumsy closer (""and smaller"").  Elsewhere in this segment, the writer splashes between metric and imperial units of measure, as a radius increases from two to six to ten feet, then expands to two meters (or 6.2 feet).  This is not an isolated example.<br /><br />Some of the imagery is better (""Alva cast a beautiful sight: a land of stone and wooden houses intermixed with parks ..."") but there is a lot of garbage.<br /><br />A related problem is the amount of repetition:  the villains discuss each attack multiple times, adding little or nothing with each description.  Some quests or concepts get discussed multiple times within a handful of pages.  The committees go over the same issues.  Worse yet, some of these events clearly occur out of order - a main character is talking to others in one realm in between battle scenes he is participating in, which are in a different realm. The whole ""medical approach to cultivation as a brilliant innovation"" subplot was already thoroughly explored in previous books, but we go over all of that again - with some of the exact same techniques.  That's unnecessary filler, and it actually hurts continuity.<br /><br />This could be removed with more work with beta readers and editors, but its apparent that they were barely used:  there are beta reader comments and highlights that are still visible in the book, and the large number of problems show that many of the beta readers are really just early access - they aren't actually reading with a critical eye towards improvement.<br /><br />Enemies are magically more powerful and wealthier than before, rendering prior gains meaningless.  Every step forward results in another step back.  The numbers thrown around get bigger, but not in a way that matters.  The last book closed with what was supposed to be a pretty crippling blow to certain enemies.  Nothing came of that.  Some plot lines are apparently abandoned.<br /><br />It's simply not satisfying to read, and the action that makes this series enjoyable takes way too long to get going.  Erik no longer focuses on his unique battle style - a climatic fight scene involves him and a bad dude yelling ""explosion"" and ""spike"" at one another like that YouTube video of a larper shouting ""fireball"". In short, this has the same problem that took off in the last few books: a ton of meetings and committees about managing a country/business/city that were written by someone with no management experience and no research into the process.<br /><br />But the real, insulting capper?<br /><br />This is book is titled ""The Seventh Realm, Part One.""  In every other entry into the series, the main characters explored at least part of the titular realm.  In this one, they don't even make it there.  In fact, most of the book appears to happen in the first and fourth realms, in well-trod over settings.",1.0,0,2021
"Disappointing, Once Again","Ms. Hilderbrand's books used to be something to look forward to reading. Now, you never know. The Sixth Wedding is a continuation of the (much loved by me) 28 Summers.  It is now several years after Mallory's death, and Copper, just having been rejected by Stacey, who does not want to be his 6th wife (!),  decides to recreate the Labor Day Weekend in 1993 when he feels that everything went wrong. The original visitors, minus Mallory, meet at her cottage on Nantucket. So far so good until it wasn't. Spoilers here, I'm sorry, but the rematch of Fray and Leland, the budding romance of Jack's daughter and Mallory's son,  Cooper and Stacey's sudden turnaround and finally Jake's perfect match with his ex-wife were just too much. Throwing in the Brooke character who ""replaced"" Mallory, was at best, questionable.  What was the point of this novella?

Its...... Arrrgh!!!  How do I put it.,"This story is just hard to review.

I found it far too easy to put down to do anything other than read, and for me that's not normal.<br /><br />It's not a bad tale, just lacking in that special something that makes one want to find out what happens next.

"Lack of focus, lack of character, lack of......","Yuck.  Just Yuck.<br /><br />Its very hard to say anything good about this book.  The idea wasn't bad, as isekai tales can always be interesting, but from the start this one had a plot that seemed to make negative choices.<br /><br />The hero was tricked into accepting an agreement that sent him to the other world, thanks to a very high level of gullibility.  (Um, author, someone as gullible as this hero is going to die very fast in a truly hostile world - just saying).  Of course there are other issues with his journey across the barrier separating the realms and the hero ends up in the body of an old man and forced to kill to get younger.  (a really bad mechanic, that doesn't fit any RPG game worth playing, but.... author choices.)<br /><br />It only got worse from there, with the hero later discovering that while the body he was in naturally had healing magic, his ""gift"" for being a champion of an extremely dumb deity was necromancy.  And this world has a morality scoring system that gives you points for negative actions that can't be scrubbed away, so just having the magic means he's soon going to have everyone he meets going ""you are EVIL!"" because of his negative alignment score.<br /><br />Honestly, I ended up unable to continue.  The magic system was terrible, the characters were terrible, and as I said in my first paragraph it seemed like the plot took every choice that I have a very negative emotional reaction to.<br /><br />It just wasn't a tale that I enjoyed, and I can't see most people finding it interesting.

Singh Copped Out,"2 Star book but audio narration added a star.<br />I don’t know how to rate this book, as I loved these characters, this series, and this authors work, but I think Singh copped out in the relationships between Aodhan and Illium. It’s obvious the author wants these two characters to be a couple, but she chickened out in not writing an intimate scene for these two! In no other book that I’ve read by Singh has she been afraid to write an intimate scene between the two main characters. I wonder if she was afraid of the backlash from loyal readers. I saw a lot of comments on Facebook from other readers that if this was an male on male romance they would stop reading Singh.  It is a male and male romance with absolutely no sex in the book. Kissing yes, but I feel let down by Singh. Every heterosexual romance she has written has had on page sex scenes, but these two characters got nothing! Double standard! To me as a reader the characters relationship is about connection and these two have always been connected, so why not give the reader the same treatment of the romance in her other books. Singh goes on that their love transcends the physical. So does this mean all her other characters love isn’t as special. I call b.s. for Singh not having the guts to write the characters as a true M/M romance in the same way she has written her heterosexual characters.<br />I loved that I finally found out what happened to Aodhan and I loved getting to know the young cadre. But I feel let down by this book. The other books in the series are so action packed that this one felt hollow in plot. So this is only getting three generous stars from me, as the audiobook narration pulled the stars up.",3.0,0,2021

"Really, really excellent book - except one thing","This is an extremely good, detailed, history of Scotland.  It's by far the best history of Scotland I've encountered so far.  I never knew Alistair Moffat could write like this.  In fact, the consensus of reviews of his books as a whole seems to be he's a genuine veritable historian when he wants to be.  However I'm more used to Alistair Moffat as one of a small group of wannabe English academic genetic genealogists blithly reciting mythology and telling people mythological history of for isntance their Y DNA, in blatant complete contradiction to the facts.<br /><br />Moffat starts out with his usual poetic myth history of Scotland from which one can occasionally extract an occasional fact, that might be factual and might not.  But at the point of the Norman Conquest, he abruptly begins to write history.<br /><br />From this point he thoroughly covers the development of every Scottish institution.  HIs covering of the clans could be more detailed, but one gets a clear idea that their origin is multi-ethnic and lies in the feudal mess of Scotland under the Normans.  However the clans continued to evolve up to the Reformation.<br /><br />He covers how the Scottish peasantry lived.  He covers the Scottish Reformation.  He covers political developments more or less as biography.  He gives a economic history.  He covers the Jacobite conflict and the breakup of the clans in full detail.  He talks about the history of coal mining and includes what it was like to be a coal miner.  He covers the rise of Glasgow in great detail.<br /><br />Moffat keeps me reading, and leaves me with a sense that I know what happened.<br /><br />There is just one major flaw so far.  He doesn't actually MISS the fact that slavery built Glasgow, you can easily discern how that happened if you already knew how it happened.  Once or twice he actually drops the S word.  Specifically, Moffat tells us that Glasgow was built with trade with Virginia in tobacco, trade with the southern U.S. in slaves, and shipbuilding for the triangle trade.  He does not explain, and one needs it explained to grasp it, that the savings in money by using slaves to grow tobacco and cotton instead of paid labor, together with a host of institutions that supported slavery and cross-Atlantic trade, enabled Capitalism to develop.  Further, the textile industry of England and southwestern Scotland could not have grown had the huge amounts of cotton that was needed cost actual money.  And then, while Moffat tells us that in the main the landlords who took part in the highland clearances weren't the same people as earlier feudal lords and clan chiefs, he does NOT tell us they got the wealth they invested in these estates, from their slave plantations in the Carribean.  Of course people like that did not have the same emotional cross-tensions impeding them from turning out the people who lived on those estates that the original landlords would have.  This is quite an omission from someone who is otherwise so thorough.  But from someone who so clearly has devoted his life to appealing to the British academic aristocracy I suppose it's to be expected.

"It isn't love, it's Stockholm Syndrome.","While the political intrigue in this book is very well written, the entire series should come with a barrel full of Content and Trigger Warnings. The book starts with the male main character completely removing the agency of the female main character and it gets worse from there. He ends up removing her free will and while he eventually feels remorse about it, there is a constant barrage of 'Look what you made me do' with emotional abuse, manipulation, verbal abuse, gaslighting. And.. this.. is supposed to be... a love story? No. This is Stockholm Syndrome and it's chilling to read. I'm on the last book and there is no redemption arc, though it's written as if it should read like one. None of this emotional abuse would have been necessary for the books to be a really good read and the inclusion of it poisons them and turns them from a series that could have been on par with CL Polk's Witchmark to a slightly better written Twilight. The male main is vile and pretty much all the men in the books are vile to the point it's a hair shy of being a misandrist manifesto and while that might be deliberate since the entire series is literally a return to an era where women were barely considered people, it makes the series very emotionally tiring to read. I can't recommend this series and I feel like I need to actively warn people before they read it due to the nature of the abuse that is the backbone of these books. It's a series where: if that male main pulled this on anyone I know and one of the ways out was his death? The city compost heap would be that much bigger. If my friend acted like they were in love with their abuser, I would stage an intervention up to and including cult deprogramming. It's just a shame I can't do that for the character in this book.",2.0,0,2021

Very Informative; Very Rigid,"As of now I have gotten through a very large chunk of this book. I am someone who is newer to working with the akashic records, I have done 3 readings prior to starting this book after finishing another, and this book feels stifling. I love her very grounded guidance, but I absolutely assure you if you do not connect to her process, you don't need it in order to enter the akashic records. I think her attempts at forcing readers to acknowledge her as a teacher and not read for others, not change the blessing, not change their visual preparation, not to use chakras, is ridiculous. The writer is very rigid, which is odd given the fluidity and the pure knowledge without right or wrong in the records. This book is good, but please take it with a grain if salt, and follow your own souls guidance on how to open yourself to the akashic records. The truth is in you, what you need is within yourself.

Not as good as Schitt's Creek,"This book is essentially Shitt's Creek fan fiction. The heroine is based on the Alexis character in that show. Alexis is the airhead daughter in the wealthy Rose family from NYC. The family lost all their money and ended up in the tiny backwater town of Schitt's Creek. It's an archetypal ""fish out of water"" story. It's hilarious. But Alexis is actually the least compelling of all the characters.<br />In this book, the Alexis character is Piper Bellinger, the rather worthless stepdaughter of a wealthy Academy Award winning Hollywood producer. She is more of a modern day Paris Hilton, an insufferable social media influencer who is famous for being famous. It's tough to get past the first few chapters because Piper is so insufferable.<br />After Piper's arrest, her stepfather sends her to Westport in the Pacific Northwest. It's not Schitt's Creek. It's way nicer. This is still a ""fish out of water"" story, almost literally because she meets Brendan, a sea captain. They are opposites, they fall in love, and Piper comes to terms with her shallow self-absorbed past. Her transformation is much like Alexis Rose.<br />Unfortunately, there was never a moment when I actually cared about Piper. She never evolves into more than a fan fiction version of Alexis. I've read all of Tessa Bailey's books and I'm afraid this is not a very good one. I'm not sure why her book prices have more than doubled. In this case, it is not worth it,",2.0,0,2021

I must’ve read a different book,"I seriously don’t understand how this book got so many amazing reviews. The heroine is a pathetic doormat, the “comedy” is childish, the editing is bad, and the guys are worthless. I honestly think this could have been such a good book because I like the idea of the storyline, but the execution was terrible. This supposedly elite team of jaguar shifters leave a girl to die in the Amazon because they don’t want to be tied down to a mate, plus they get ambushed over and over so I honestly can’t think of them being elite. If they’re the only thing standing between the bad guys and the rest of the world, the bad guys are definitely going to win. They seriously leave Amaryllis injured, exhausted from saving them, and starving, but the second any of them pays her a moment of semi-kindness, she’s all over them because “they’re hot.”  I wish this could be rewritten, because I’d give it another shot if the heroine grew a backbone and some of the dumber aspects were thrown out (I guess her choking to death, literally, on a beetle while gaping at the guys is supposed to be comedy?). I gave two stars because I read it until the end with fingers crossed that it would get better, but it never did. Hard pass on this one.",2.0,0,2021

"""Barely""?  Seriously?","On the one hand, what would I expect from Allen who took all the information available about the Trump/Clinton campaign and decided to ignore 80% of it (Putin's interference on Trump's behalf--same with Assange/WikiLeaks--all ""welcomed"" by Trump, per numerous reports, including last year's Senate Intelligence committee.  Instead, Allen blamed Hillary and came up with ""Shattered"" (dreams... no glass ceiling broken... etc.)<br /><br />So I shouldn't have really been surprised by such an unflattering look at Trump's 2020 opponent's campaign.  Even though Biden got a -record- number of votes and beat Trump by 7 million votes--hardly ""barely"".  He also won 306 to 232 -- the same margin that Trump called a ""landslide"" when he had the same total in 2016.<br /><br />I gave this book an extra star (total: 2) because they did a ton of interviews and research and organized all that information very well, in nearly 500 pages. That's not easy, so although I dislike a lot of their ""trees not forest"" approach, kudos for that difficult task.<br /><br />The problem is twofold:  (1) They don't seem to know Joe Biden and he never becomes a central figure even though this book is all about his campaign.  It appears they interviewed many involved, but not Biden himself. Or his wife. Or Harris. So it's flawed by just not having any real personality or narrative.  Also...<br /><br />(2) Another narrative in a book about one person's campaign, would be the competition. For that, Allen would have needed a lot more about Trump. There's...some... a bit about covid and George Floyd in particular. But overall, it is very, very weak on Trump and without him--and without a real look at Biden--how can you understand why Biden won?<br /><br />You can't. That's why the biggest problem is that the book basically ends on Nov 7th when all votes have been counted and Biden is clearly the winner. That means, they missed the crazy transition and all of Trump's efforts to undermine the results. Yes, they are able to tack on an introduction that describes the events of January 6.  But, given the rest of the book--no insight into Trump or his campaign and strategy--the events of Jan 6 just seem ""out of the blue"". If anything they highlight all the weaknesses of this book--not the research or organization and writing, but the real lack of historical point of view.  As a result, it's just not a very good book unless you have great fascination for the minutiae of staff experience on a presidential campaign.",2.0,0,2021

Superficial novels,"There isn't a great deal favorable that can be said about these novels.  The characters lack depth and most are irritating,  the plots are superficial and unrealistic, the action is limited, the oddball reactions of the characters to the action is frustrating, and the dialog is simplistic.  The main character, Chelsea, makes noises about being strong, liberated, and competent, but she is none of these.  She panics or acts inappropriately in virtually every situation, and her naivete fits with a small town woman, but she supposedly was a successful interior designer in New York city with many high value clients.  The ignorance and unsophisticated actions don't fit and become extremely irritating. I wanted to find something to like about her or to identify with, but there was nothing there. Another main character, Teeny, is one of the most irritating, clueless, inappropriate characters  I have run across in any novel.  Her sister, Peach, is almost as bad.  The cute cop who is always sending Chelsea into a tizzy comes across as dumb as a box of rocks and the stirrings of romance are just silly on both sides. I have never given this severe a review to any novel previously, but I stopped reading after the second of 10 novels in this series, and think it was a feat I could get that far.",1.0,0,2021

Eric Ugland doesn't want to write these books anymore but loves the easy money. 2.5 stars,"That's really the only explanation for this volume, as well as the last 3 in the Bad Guys series and the previous one in this series. He writes these on a schedule with some kind of fill-in-the-blank template, he never does a second draft, and he doesn't really care what happens, or even IF anything happens at all.<br /><br />First, the good:<br /><br />This book is much better than the last 3 Bad Guys books, which were all awful. It is actually readable and some attempt was made to make sure that it made a vague amount of sense to the reader. So good for him on that point. Also, the plot actually moves forward a bit. Good for that as well. The fact that you can actually read this (unlike the last 2 Bad Guys books) is why I gave it 2.5 stars. It serves the function of a book because you can read it and obtain information.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's all the good stuff. The bad:<br /><br />Eric has forgotten that this is LitRPG. At no point in the entire book does Montana look at his skill sheet, talk about his skill sheet, talk about what skills he'd like to work on next, talk about his build progression, talk about what he's going to do when he levels up, nowhere does he level up a skill and he doesn't level up in levels until the last page. This is no longer a LitRPG book. It's just a fantasy book with a smart talking narrator.<br /><br />Second, Montana has become incredibly stupid, to a Forrest Gump-type level. In the early books in this series he would be called stupid by other people but he never was. On message boards people have been complaining for awhile that he acts stupid, which at times was fair. But now he just IS stupid. He says how stupid he is multiple times in this book. He never picks up on the most obvious things. He is presented to us as being unable to do elementary school math. He breaks important items and ""forgets"" to replace them. Him being ridiculously stupid is basically his entire personality now.<br /><br />No matter how much warning he has, he never prepares for trouble on the horizon. No matter how serious a danger is, he ignores it til the last second. He needs a celestial weapon to fight the horde of demons in his front yard? And he has celestial weapons in the basement? Great, I guess he just goes and gets one right? WRONG. he goes outside to fight the demons without a celestial weapon, because why wouldn't he? Just stuff like that, over and over. It's ridiculous to the point of being immersion breaking.<br /><br />Third, Eric Ugland just cannot get the technical nuts and bolts parts of writing straight. He just can't do it. He will introduce three characters that all serve the same purpose and give them names like Eddie, Eddio, and Eddiee and have them say similar sounding stuff to each other in every scene so you have no idea which is which. He can't figure out the font he is using so several sentences in the book are obscured by the actual characters in the words. He assigns Montana quests and instantly forgets about them for five straight books. He has the main characters call a meeting, and then push every topic of discussion to the next meeting. He constantly re-uses things that are supposed to be shocking, like gory beheadings or whatever, until they aren't shocking at all. He can't remember the rules of his own universe.<br /><br />Frequently in this series, but especially in this book, previous events are forgotten. The bear people he took in a couple of books ago are not mentioned at all. The centaurs are dismissed after 2 pages. The Thingmen? no mention of them here. Just on and on, dropped plot point after dropped plot point. He gets a gift from his arch enemy, a physical gift, and keeps it in his room. Later, a character literally says to him ""if only we had something this guy had touched we could cast a spell and find him"". Montana, who has the gift that the guy touched, says ""yeah too bad we don't"" and it's never mentioned again. Why. It's just maddening. They have a spell that detects the hidden bad guy, even to the point of being able to tell if he's in the room with them. Do they lock the castle down and go room to room to find him? Of course not, why would you. They'd rather stumble around for 400 pages wondering where he's at and who he's disguised as instead.<br /><br />Just like in the last book of The Bad Guys, major characters are killed here and no one even seems to care. It's treated almost like a joke.<br /><br />Several major mysteries are revealed and just peter out. Someone opens a door and invites demons into the mountain home. Who? We aren't told. Why? We aren't told. No one seems to care. A character is revealed to be an imposter but the timeline for them being replaced is impossibly murky and makes zero sense. Without spoiling it, we are told that an item that was flamboyantly destroyed by the major bad guy in a previous book was in fact something that's vital to his efforts and not something he would have ever destroyed. No attempt is made to explain this. Montana is attacked by assassins in a way that makes no sense and halfway through fighting the FOUR assassins, Ugland apparently forgets how many there are and describes three deaths and three dead bodies and just drops the whole thing.<br /><br />The final fight with the bad guy that Montana has been searching for these last 3-4 books is literally resolved in under 3 pages. We're given a ""the real magic was the friendships we formed along the way"" moral to go with it, in case we didn't find the main plot being treated as an afterthought to be condescending enough.  I can't describe this without spoiling it, but MAJOR parts of how the world works, as established in previous books, are violated in this one in ways that are impossible to ignore or reconcile. This seems to be done mostly out of laziness on Ugland's part and not as any kind of deliberate choice.<br /><br />Less vital but still annoying points:<br /><br />Mister Paul laboriously says over and over that he can't cheat to help Montana, then cheats anyway to help Montana. It's handled in such a cutesy way that its mostly just annoying. No one watching Montana win over and over with the magic items Paul just handed him could conclude anything other than that Paul is cheating to save Montana but we have to go through this whole dumb production over and over in every book.<br /><br />At one point Paul gives Montana a ""hint"" that makes zero sense and has nothing to do with the eventual resolution of the problem in the book.<br /><br />Also in between the last book and this one, Ugland learned about how people wink at other people sometimes! He likes the idea so much that he has over 50 people wink at other people in this one book. I hope you like 3 winks a page because that's what you're getting. ""Hey princess! *wink* Oh you have your niece with you? Hello little girl *wink* Oh and she has a sister? *wink* for her too! Good day!"" on page after page. It is mind-numbingly repetitious and serves no purpose at all.<br /><br />Speaking of mind-numbing repetition, we get the same 4 ""Gosh isn't slavery bad you guys"" conversations in this book that we have gotten in every single book in both the Good Guys and Bad Guys series to date. NO ONE is standing up for slavery, suggesting slavery, defending slavery, being freed from slavery, etc. It's just something people blurt out on first meeting other people. ""Hey I'm Baron Jim"" is met with ""Hey Baron Jim, I'm Montana and I hate slavery!"" for absolutely no reason I can tell. Over and over, not just once. At least in the Bad Guys series the action is in a country that allows slaves. Not here, it's outlawed and yet Montana and friends won't stop talking about how terrible it is. Bear in mind that people are literally being sacrificed by the thousands to demons in this book, and that gets less objection than the slavery that doesn't exist does.<br /><br />So why are we getting this conversation? Because it says we need one on Ugland's fill in the blank template. Just like it says we need ANOTHER conversation about how the protagonist won't let anyone hurt the Kobolds, who actually are not dumb at all, thank you. It's the same five conversations every book and it is tedious as hell.<br /><br />So anyway, to sum up: No LitRPG, no levels up, no plot advancement to speak of other than character deaths, no pay off to the big mysteries, no normal sounding conversations at all. The point of every convo in this book is to highlight what a great guy Montana is. He's just so amazing and special, and there is no plot beyond that.<br /><br />The next one will be just this sloppy and dumb, I know it already. So why bother reading it. If you read this whole thing, don't bother reading this book either. The Mayor of Noobtown series is superior to this one in every way, go try that. Dungeon Crawler Carl is better than this one in every way, go try that one too.",3.0,0,2021
"Young, mostly passive MC dragged along by pedestrian plot.","The MC in this tale is 11 or 12, and the village ""trainer"" has refused to teach him due to ""reasons"" that really did not fit the post-apoc feel of the village the story is based in.  Of course, the ""reasons"" make sense to the main villains in the piece, but other than the playground bully with an entourage, none of the villains seems to play much of a role in the tale.<br /><br />And that's just my initial thoughts.  Honestly, this tale had big plot holes, unreasonable plot holes, silly plot holes....... have I mentioned the plot holes?  Anyways, the plot just never comes together.  Yes, the MC needs to train to level 10 to escape the village, and there are quirks on how to train.  Yes, he gets the trainer to give him a book that somehow only he can understand. (the other children in the village get the same book and still train incorrectly.)  Yes, he even helps others with their training once he's as high a level as any of the other village children.<br /><br />Yet, he allows himself to be bullied constantly.  I have to wonder if the author was bullied in school, or watched one.  I remember my time in school and bullies just don't keep going after one person, especially if that person is not drawing attention to themselves or giving up money/favors.  Bullies tend to be lazy and the one in this book is massively lazy and dumb.  There was little logic in him going after the MC, especially in a ""starving"" village that needs everyone working to stay alive.<br /><br />In the end, I find this to be definitely another ""one and done"" series for me.  The MC's youth and inability to stand up for himself most of the time left me unimpressed by him and I will not suffer through a sequel where he does the same thing only with a new group of villains in a new location with new stakes.  (that was hinted at in the epilogue of this book.)<br /><br />Some might enjoy, but its not a very Wuxia novel.  The gains in level are barely noticed, there is no meditation/cultivation scenes, and there is no observed wisdom.<br /><br />My suggest is to give this one a pass, but its not poorly written or a hard read, I just found it to be mundane and unexciting.

Mixed feelings on this one,"This book was weird. And not in that quirky, unpredictable sense. Its weird because, while it contains all the necessary elements of a book of this genre: a plucky FMC (Tempest), a clear antagonistic force (the darkness and king of Ledenaether), a group of secondary characters with unique roles that either help or hinder the MCs progress, a complex world with a distinct magic system, and a plot that moves from one action towards (or away) from that goal.<br /><br />Except that the writing style of the whole book seems to be deliberately obtuse. Like the author really wanted to be very artistic and evocative in her approach to the narrative, (and sometimes she succeeded) but mostly it was just hard to follow. Often the style was jarring. Its hard to explain without making direct references to text that might spoil the story, so I will just say that this approach to the narrative was kind of awful for the reader. I had to go back often to reread something because it just wasn't all that clear. Too often the meaning was lost in unimportant details or obfuscated by a very choppy and disjointed structure.<br /><br />And that says nothing about the pacing. The pacing was just all over the place. Mostly it flowed along at a fast, albeit kind of muddy pace with few ups or downs to give it rhythm. That ended up making scenes like the big climactic fight scene about as distinct in the story as when the FMC is bathing (for the 3rd time in as many pages.) The final climax scene was presented in such a detached, distant way that I felt like it didn't really matter to the author any more than when Tempest changed her clothes or did anything, really. Just another crappy, watch-our-hero-get-walloped-again scene.<br /><br />Which was another thing. As other reviewers groused, there is literally nothing good that happens to the hero, unless you count when the sun came out that one time. Or how she manages to survive, but barely, every other page.<br /><br />This is supposedly a romance, tho a dark one, but all the male 'love' interests are actually disgusted and repelled by her. All of them. All the time. Thats weird. When one of the five 'masters' interacts with her it usually feels like a mix of a decades-older teacher with a junior high student kind of ickiness to the interaction, mixed with a heavy dose of abuse. They just manipulate and compel her. Often without any clear reason. Supposedly, the masters need her to choose one of them to marry, so they decide that they will force her to choose one by almost killing her daily, sometimes several times a day. Why? I dunno. Tempest dunno. I don't think even the author knows exactly why the dudes are each trying to almost kill the FMC, doing it just to make the plot feel more dangerous and dark, while raising the stakes. I am all for an enemies to lovers trope, but this is something else. To do that the MCs have to see something attractive in one another at the very least. But these guys are just big scary roadbumps, at least they have the personality of roadbumps. Calder is the only one who is remotely human or attractive, and even he seems mildly disgusted by Tempest 99% of the time.<br /><br />Again, just weird.<br /><br />I am actually going to start book 2. I am curious if maybe, just maybe, this was all part of the authors master plan. One of those books where you get led all wrong and then a twist makes everything click. Maybe this is going somewhere. If so I will revise this review a bit. Unfortunately, I am expecting it to be a little more than voluntary headache at this point, if only based on that super detached and dissociative finale.",2.0,0,2021

Don't waste your time!,"I cannot believe that this was written by J.R. Ward. It can't be possible. It is like untying cooked spaghetti's. The Brothers are relegated to an afterthought. It has no continuity and the series needs an ending to make sense. Sorry, but it was really hard work to read and go back and forth to figure what was really going on in this book. Disappointed is not strong enough of a statement. If you want the real energy and flavor of The Brotherhood, re-read the 1st to the last book in the series in order.",1.0,0,2021
Hot Mess!!!!!,"I’ve been waiting for years for Ward to write the Wolven series! I’ve been with this author since her first book. I’ve forgiven minor continuity issues, as Ward built her world, but for her to publish this hot mess of a book is stunning. Can Ward not write a new series without having to bring over the BDB characters. I assume the author saw this premise not being able to stand on it’s own, which is a shame. This book was hard for me to finish as it seems that Ward has surrounded herself with sycophants and yes people at her publisher, or they would have told her the plot was convoluted.<br />Ward’s editors are craptastic. Her beta readers are craptastic. As with Ward’s books for the past five years or so this one has continuity errors and plot points weren’t even researched. Case in point, canines needing oxygen don’t wear masks, even sedated, as it doesn’t provide a good fit. They are given oxygen in a chamber. An oxygen mask for a canine is for temporary measures not long term. It’s instances like these that pull be right out of a book. If the plot starts with an injured wolf, at least know how to treat that wolf. As the injured wolf is a major plot device, know how to execute it.<br />Next eye color, changes from whiskey to  golden eyes. Since it wasn’t commented on it wasn’t a plot device; just a sloppy writer and editor. It’s as if Ward has ADD and can’t remember how she described characters. WTH, I’ll give a pass to mistakes by a newbie Indie author but not a New York Times bestselling one!<br />I keep coming back and sinking my money into this series wanting to read the magic of her first books, and time and again I am disappointed. The only recent book that had the Ward spark was Dearest Ivy, and I had hoped she found her mojo again, but my hopes keep getting dashed.",1.0,0,2021
You need a book to explain this book,"I have to be honest.  This book is written at way too high a level. I played in band in high school. Later in life came back to music but my theory was never strong because it was never actually explained. This book is no different. For instance if you don't know what the degree markings are on the circle...he won't tell you. Just looks like a bunch of roman numerals to me. Not even a clue where to go find the definition. If you want a method to memorize drawing the circle, he's got that covered. That's about all I've gotten from this book.  I'm finding it hard to get very far due to the lack of explanation and lack of where to get a basic theory lesson to get to this level.",3.0,0,2021
Is Cooking Porn a thing?,"Because I’d totally be into it after reading this book.  Gah, could Austin BE any more perfect?! I read this entire book with a weird little half smile that I couldn’t wipe off my face, it was great!<br />Honestly, reading this series is like being one of the “cool kids” because you ‘get’ all the hilarious inside jokes. The ones that make you randomly laugh days later, usually at inappropriate times, when you remember them. Like I want to yell “no one has power over me!” and rip up my tax paperwork or something equally destructive! If you read the book, you’d get the joke. Also I have Johnny Cash's A Boy Named Sue on repeat right now laughing my head off. And don’t forget the freaking dolls LMAO.<br />I've decided that since I can’t have Austin (cry) I’d happily accept Brachen, who we meet in this book, protective alpha males with strong arms are my crack.  The final group is almost complete and I love them all.<br />This book had the humor we’ve come to expect. And some serious plot advancements. There is not much I can say without spoilers, I definitely don’t want to spoil this book for anyone. But I will say this, all those suspicions you had in the last book are proven in this one. And the full story is amazeballs.<br />I totally expect the next book to contain an epic Rocky-esque training montage, I hope we get an equally awesome musical score to go with it. Ms. Breene it would be fantastic if you could slip in a little Eye of the Tiger action (fingers crossed).<br />To sum up; take the shirt off, put the apron on, and turn up the heat!",5.0,1,2021

An honest Republican protecting democracy from a corrupt president,"[11.7.21 Note: After seeing him going even harder in support of the false equivalency between Abrams and Trump than in the book--between genuine steps of voter suppression and a fantasy narrative of voter fraud--even falsely making it sound like she influenced Trump's actions (!)--I've subtracted a star. Seems he has bowed to some political pressure after all, in order to minimize Trump's unprecedented corruption.]<br /><br />Usually, when a politician starts describing his own integrity and courage, it’s time for an eye-roll, especially when he’s affiliated with the political party that is currently known for having very little of either. But Americans learned the hard way (from seeing President Trump try to steal an election) that Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was exactly as he claims, an honest public servant committed to doing his job and respecting the law.<br /><br />Raffensperger's refusal to be bullied into lying and cheating on behalf of the President of the United States made him one of a handful of public servants who showed real courage and integrity and genuinely helped save American democracy after the 2020 election.<br /><br />His phone call with Donald Trump—which we can all hear for ourselves (and read in full in 40 pages here, including annotation about the real facts )—is still shocking, even today. Shocking not only to be reminded of the desperate lengths that Donald Trump was willing to go to in order to stay in power, but also because of how it led to his supporters’ frightening attacks on those like Raffensperger who insisted on telling the truth and who wouldn’t give in to the president’s lies.<br /><br />Raffensperger, Georgia’s Secretary of State (now running for reelection), was doing his job in running a clean, fair election. Trump lost--then lost 2 recounts.  (Trump's divisive campaigning didn't help. As Raffensperger points out, 28,000 Republicans left their vote for president blank, while voting for other Republicans down ballot.)  With no evidence of fraud, he refused to accept the result, even though Georgia’s 16 electoral votes wouldn’t have given him the presidency anyway.<br /><br />Plus, Trump would have had to take at least 3 states from Biden. That wasn't happening—look at the numbers in the states he was contesting. Trump lost every recount and, to date, has lost 64 court cases. Even the absurd and partisan “Cyber Ninja” recount in Arizona concluded that Biden actually beat Trump by 361 more votes than originally tallied.  Trump lost Arizona, just like he lost Georgia.  Fairly.<br /><br />The threats to election workers started on November 4, with lies and anger egged on by Trump. Raffensperger asks a simple question: “In what world is it okay to threaten peoples’ lives over political differences?” Yes, and to that, I have to add, “Why are these kinds of threats not considered a crime?” Raffensperger’s wife received vile sexual threats and death threats by text. One read, “please pray. We plan for the death of you and your family every day. I’m sorry.”<br /><br />Creepy, scary stuff. All over an election tally that Trump lost every time—whether Georgia’s 5 million votes were counted by hand or by machine. And all of Trump’s allegations of “fraud” were debunked over and over—not only by election officials like Georgia’s Gabe Sterling (a Republican who, like Raffensperger, voted for Trump), but even by Trump’s own campaign team and the AG. He wouldn't listen.<br /><br />The recorded phone call—read it in full here—is such an important piece of history. Raffensperger and the Georgia SOD counsel, Ryan Germany, told the President the truth—“you don’t have the correct information”—and repeatedly told him the facts. They told him the truth:  he lost. He clearly didn’t want to hear any facts. What he wanted, was for them to “find me” 11,780 votes, “which is one more than we have” [i.e. need].<br /><br />Sterling, angry at the violence being directed at so many innocent people, even begged Trump via a press conference in December to (essentially) call off his goons before someone got killed. Instead, Trump only amped up the confrontational rhetoric, finally getting the last-ditch January 6th insurrection that he wanted (and six people did die because of it).<br /><br />The conflict between Raffensperger and Trump in Georgia will probably be the stuff of plays and movies in the future. It truly was historic and Raffensperger is wise to write a book that shows not only what really happened, but also shows –his- version of the truth about Brad Raffensperger himself. He really does come across as honest and earnest--and very very patient as he listens to Trump's lying on the phone for 20 minutes before politely correcting him.  (The phone call transcript and his annotations with the facts, are included here--40 pages.)<br /><br />As Trump himself insisted on January 6th, “nothing” could ever make him concede.<br /><br />Now 67, Raffensperger was a structural engineer heading a successful company when he entered politics at 56. He’s been married to his high school sweetheart for 45 years. (She also writes comments in parts of the book.) They both write a considerable amount here about their Christian beliefs and how religion has helped them through crises—the worst, the death of their son from opioids. He talks about the importance of family throughout—not only his wife and children, but also the moral examples set by his parents. It’s a book about the importance of honesty, integrity and morality. (Read any book by Donald Trump for a contrast in themes.)<br /><br />However, as criticism, I –do- have to take exception to how he sets up a false equivalency between Trump's and Stacey Abrams’ claims of being cheated out of their Georgia election.<br /><br />In 2020, Georgia—by all accounts—ran a clean election. But in 2019, Brian Kemp was overseeing the his own governor’s race against Abrams (as SOS, and refusing to recuse). He only won by 55,000 votes, 1.4 percent. Unlike 2020, in 2019, Kemp pulled a lot of tricks out—that could be called voter suppression: deleting 700,000 from the voter rolls, eliminating registrations of at least 50,000 voters, eliminating 200 polling places/creating extremely long waits in those areas—and all of it disproportionately affected poor and minority voters most likely to vote Democratic. (This is from the Washington Post’s fact check.)<br /><br />Raffensperger treats Abrams’ complaints and Trump’s similarly, but it’s really not fair. The WP concluded that there genuine ethical concerns with what Kemp did, even though no one could definitively say that Abrams’ would otherwise have won. So, not good that Raffensperger seems to try to prove his Republican bona fides with this false comparison.<br /><br />Abrams' differences aside, “Integrity Counts” is a good look at an important moment in history—and an important reminder--across political parties-- how someone of character could courageously stand up to a very powerful and corrupt leader and protect democracy.",4.0,1,2021

"I want to bang my head against a wall, it will hurt less than reading about another dumb MC","I'll admit that the book I read before this had a main character that probably couldn't add one and one and get two.  This main character isn't quite that bad, but.... he's stupid.  Worse this story used the ""I'll deny my child critical information in the hope that he'll never need it"" trope and of course, he ends up needing it and freaking out because he's now completely unprepared for the magical world he's in.<br /><br />Combine the lack of knowledge of the shifter world, with a character who is dumber than a box of rocks and who gets lost in his own thoughts constantly.  (Seriously, authors do NOT allow your main characters to think to themselves for pages on end.  Actions by the character are interesting.  mental soliloquies, especially angsty ones, are excruciating to read.)<br /><br />Honestly, I did not expect much from this tale.  I've read a number of Eric Vail books and his main characters tend to be less than impressive and often openly unheroic.  These stories appear to be about finding ways to get hero A to put tab P into multiple women's slot V.  If that is what you are looking for, this will almost certainly pique your interest as Eric does work hard to try to make those scenes interesting.  (Sorry Eric, I've read too many erotic tales and I don't read for those scenes, so you need to offer me real characters).<br /><br />But clearly that is me.  Its not a story I can say is objectively ""bad"", but it definitely did not offer me the quality characters that I am looking for.  I think those wanting the typical mindless harem tale where the MC gets vast quantities of low quality zipless sex with women who fawn over him, but never offer him a true challenge, will enjoy this immensely.",3.0,0,2021

Taking advantage of a person with dementia - a sorry premise for a story.,"I cannot believe that anyone could write a story about a woman with dementia with anything but compassion and caring, and yet, this author seems to think it is just fine to write a light-hearted tale about a sick woman who loses everything because of actions driven by her illness.  Imagine if you were ill with dementia, and because of your illness you lost everything in the world that you once owned -- no one cared enough to help you.  That is this story.  The very, very sad story of a sick woman who loses everything she owns because no one cared to help her.  The main character is allowed to sell everything she owned for pennies -- no one stops her.  Her worldly possessions could have been legitimately sold to fund her care, if that was needed, or someone could have appointed her a guardian to help her, but no.  This story does nothing more than make fun of a woman sick with dementia, and that is disgusting.  Where is the author's compassion?

DUBIOUS THESIS,"I am an unstinting admirer of Richard Overy and have learned much from him over the years. This book contains a lot of interesting things about WW2 But the interpretative schema is not informative<br /> The claim is that the war was the last gasp of imperialism. But the definition of imperialism is so broad as to be useless.The British Empire and Hitler Germany are both the offspring of a colonialist mind set which, it  is<br />alleged ,inevitably leads to war. But the British Empire had at its heart  four self governing states--Newfoundland, Canada, Australia and NZ. This Hitler would never tolerate  in his ""empire"". India was not self governing but began to move slowly in that direction as early as 1900. Yes ,the British resisted this at times with force but gradual progress was made up to 1947. It is impossible to imagine the Nazi ""empire"" doing any such thing. And so the  the ""colonialist"" model is non explanatory. Its just too much of a stretch to  plug such wildly disparate  regimes into a colonialist model and proclaim it to be explanatory.",4.0,1,2021

"A Fantastic Rock and Roll ""Memoir"" From the 60's and 70's","I. Absolutely. Loved. This. Book!!!<br /><br />If Opal Jewel wasn't real, she damn well should be. She's like if you took Memphis Minnie, Rose Stone, Poly Styrene, Gladys Bentley, Tina Turner, Nona Hendryx, Nina Simone, Merry Clayton, Janelle Monae and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She's rock, punk, soul and everything.<br /><br />This was more than a book. It was a love letter to rock and roll. You know, the genre that Black folks invented only to be edged out and also edged ourselves out of? We NEED an Opal Jewel to come along and shake rock up because it desperately needs it. When asked why I'm a rock/metal fan, I merely point out that without the Blues, jazz and Black gospel, there wouldn't have been a British Invasion, much less guitar heroes as we know them.<br /><br />Thank Sister Rosetta Tharpe for the latter.<br /><br />This was a human story, of not fitting in and still making a place for oneself. Opal refused to bend or break simply because the rest of the world hadn't caught up to her sheer awesomeness, a situation many Black women can relate to. And yet, the book challenged me as a reader to discover just who Opal WAS in her own words and not as some mythical icon. She's complicated and messy at times. Her story read a little like Nina Simone's in that she was ""too Black"" for both Black and white worlds. She went bald after discovering she had alopecia. She wore colorful clothes thanks to her best friend and personal stylist, a gay Black man who was as unapologetic in his presentation as she was.<br /><br />Yes, there's Nev Charles, the red-headed lad from Brummie who saw Opal as his version of the iconic Merry Clayton (and if you don't know who she is, shame on you, lol. I mean she literally steals the spotlight from Mick Jagger on the classic 'Gimme Shelter'. She's also the background lead on 'Sweet Home Alabama' which is just so very fitting when you think about it. Watch '50 Feet from Stardom' on Netflix to see her and other amazing background vocalists of so many hits whom you may not know by name). Nev sees Opal as his muse, which of course never works out well, especially one as driven to carve a niche for herself as an equal.<br /><br />I really loved the format of the novel, written as both memoir and article. Sunny Curtis is the journalist/protagonist with a complex and uncomfortable tie to her subject, Opal Jewel. Sunny, like her subject, is a Black woman in a highly visible position that sometimes causes her to dim her shine or question herself. Another thing that made this novel stand out was how real life musicians/producers were interwoven into the narrative - I'd like to think Henry Rollins really would have admired Opal as a performer and provocateur.",5.0,1,2021
Educational and supportive,"Dr. Ramani is amazing.  I bought this years ago, when I was beginning to suspect what I was dealing with.  It was educational -- and terrifying to get a clear picture of what I had only suspected, because these people are dangerous in so many ways.  Unlike most authors and experts, though, Dr. Ramani understands that there are valid reasons that people may not be able to leave, or at least not be able to leave now.  I was one of those.  But she gave suggestions on how to prepare to leave.  I spent years prepping so that when an opportunity opened up, or if I had to flee suddenly, I could leave with more than the clothes on my back.  I finally got out in my 60s after over 30 years of marriage.  Thanks, Dr. Ramani, for helping make that possible -- and thanks to my support system for helping me find the courage.<br /><br />Additionally, and so importantly, Dr. Ramani tells you how to stay in the relationship, if you must.  It isn't ideal, but if you're going to stay the only way to avoid being destroyed is to do what she advises.  And even if you don't think you ever will be able to leave, force yourself to take some safe measures to do so.<br /><br />It's a slog to get through a day in a narcissistically abusive relationship.  But you've made it to here.  You are still getting up and functioning.  The N hasn't destroyed you yet, and you have developed coping skills and strength.  You are surviving!  Keep doing whatever it takes to survive until you can break free, even on days when you don't see that ever happening.  Probably the only positive to come from a N relationship is when you realize how strong you are, how brave.  But you are a Warrior!<br /><br />Good luck on this journey, from one survivor to another.",5.0,1,2021

"Review of audiobook version of fun, G-rated, New Adult, ""best friend’s brother,"" romantic comedy","Abby and Zane are both 23 and have known each other for years, because he is the twin of Zoey, her BFF and roommate since university. Though Abby has had a crush on handsome Zane for years, she has never done anything about it because she doesn’t want to risk her friendship with Zoey. But when Zane hires Abby, who is a computer-programmer whiz, to fix a glitch with his startup’s software, she begins to develop far stronger romantic feelings for Zane than she can continue to resist. Especially when he seems equally attracted to her.<br /><br />This is a really fun, fast-paced, New Adult (NA) romance novel. It is billed as a romantic comedy, and it does have a lot of humorous moments, but it also has an entertaining, light-drama subplot of a mystery to be solved as to who is sabotaging Zane’s startup.<br /><br />It is quite enjoyable to experience an author who writes a G-rated, NA romance without the crudely detailed sex scenes that tend to overwhelm the romance in typical NA romance novels. In addition, there are no drunken parties, no drugs, no smoking, and no foul language.<br /><br />I’m a very jaded romance reader, and these days, more often than not, I tend to skim big sections of romance novels. Not so with this book. I was fully engaged all the way through and read every word. Abby and Zane are sympathetic, compelling characters, and though there is no more than kissing in this book, there is plenty of emotional and sexual chemistry between them. I fully believed they are made for each other and deserve their well-motivated HEA.<br /><br />In addition to reading the Kindle version of this book when it was first released, I recently had the chance to enjoy the newly released audiobook version of this novel. It is narrated by two very skilled voice talents, Melie Williams and Kevin Eiger. Both narrators do a great job portraying male and female characters of all ages, and I really enjoyed the convincing job they both did acting out the parts of all the characters.<br /><br />It is a true test of the quality of a novel if it can stand up to the glaring spotlight of being performed by a voice artist. When a novel is experienced being read silently to oneself at 350-450 words per minute, many problematic issues can slide by unnoticed. This is not the case when listening to a book narrated at 80-85 words per minute. In that situation, every flaw in a story stands out. I am happy to report that this adorable novel passes the audio test with flying colors, making this recording a keeper for me, which I will be happy to listen to many more times in the future.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />I rate this book as follows:<br /><br />Heroine: 5 stars<br />Hero: 5 stars<br />Subcharacters: 5stars<br />Romance Plot: 5 stars<br />Hacker Mystery Plot: 5 stars<br />Writing: 5 stars<br />Audiobook Narration: 5 stars<br />Overall: 5 stars",5.0,1,2021
Avoid any cookbooks by this author,"SL Watson has a large number of cookbooks here in Amazon that sell for just a few dollars each. I made the mistake of buying a few of them and now I write this review to try and save you from my mistake. These books have no pictures at all inside and after looking at a handful of recipes I understand why. The author seems to just be packing these books with any and every crappy recipe and likely without ever trying them. I’ll give you a for instance. There is a shrimp fried rice recipe in this book that calls for you to start with precooked shrimp and then cook the shrimp for 8 more minutes at medium heat. You can cook frozen raw shrimp in half that time. If you cook already cooked shrimp 8 more minutes you are going to wind up with tough rubbery garbage. SL Watson then riffs on fried rice with a series of other fried rice recipes. The “Chinese fried rice” which includes only 7 ingredients: meat, oil, mushrooms, rice, green onions, eggs and soy sauce. Now these ingredients might be common in “Chinese fried rice” but anyone who has had great Chinese fried rice knows you want to include much more than this. Sesame oil, yellow onion, bean sprouts, oyster sauce, garlic, peas, carrots...just a host of possibilities to make rice better. The bottom line is this: no matter how cheap these cookbooks are they aren’t worth it. These are uninspired, likely untested recipes from an author that is churning out low quality cookbooks at a high pace (just look at the poor white balance on the cover photos). You will find vastly superior recipes online complete with videos, user ratings, and tips from people who have actually tried the recipes for FREE. And don’t get me wrong, I love buying cookbooks, I have well over 700 on my kindle alone. But the thing is you only want to buy them from people who are selling genuine trusted recipes and who can teach you how to improve your cooking.

If you want anything supported by science you should look elsewhere. It comes down to who you want to pick up when you make a 911 call. If you want a medical professional then avoid this book.

"Loved this friends to lovers, sports romance set in England & Scotland!","5/5 stars<br /><br />I absolutely loved this gem of a story! I can't remember the last time the characters felt so real in a story. Mac, a Scottish football player in England, and Freya, a curvy virgin seamstress, were so good together and believable as friends and then as lovers. I really enjoyed the bickering and banter that just highlighted their amazing chemistry on page. I laughed out loud on several occasions and a few due to Freya's cat Hercules. I loved the 'love coach' aspect of this story as well that starts with Mac giving dating advice to Freya and then evolves into something more. This beautiful romance also has the best virgin sex scene I've ever read! It was sweet, sexy, funny and real. Every moment and steamy scene between these two characters was beautiful to read and I can't wait to re-read this story. This was my first romance by this author, but it definitely won't be the last!",5.0,1,2021
Good biblical encouragement to be your unique self God designed,"Why do we try to be like other people, Meyer asks, when there is so much value in our uniqueness? She suggests it is because we fear others will not accept us. She encourages us to believe that God made each of us with unique traits and abilities and that one aspect of the freedom Jesus came to offer us is the freedom to be and enjoy who we are.<br /><br />Unlike many other books on being authentic, Meyer grounds her teaching in the Bible. She establishes the foundation that God loves us. We need to learn to love ourselves. That doesn't mean we love everything we do but we love who we are in Christ. It is the answer to our desire for approval. And in case we have difficulty accepting God's love for us, there is an Appendix with confirming Scriptures.<br /><br />Meyer helps us understand who we are in Christ and helps us avoid the trap of focusing on what other people think. She gives practical suggestions for developing a new mindset and overcoming fear, helps us understand we are to aim to please God, not people, and much more.<br /><br />The teaching from Meyer that had the most impact on me was that I can be guided by God. God has gifted me to fit into His perfect plan. I cannot let other people tell me what to do with my life. And even if I miss it, God will find me and lead me on.<br /><br />This book is grounded in biblical truth and is a great one for people who want to accept their uniqueness, be the person God wants them to be, and have the courage to follow their heart. As Meyer says, you owe it to yourself to be the best version you can be of yourself.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",5.0,1,2021
Great insight,This book really dives into the facts of what's going on now and how we got here. I'm a California native and what's been going on has baffled and disturbed me greatly. I live in Southern California and Los Angeles is suffering many of the same ailments as San Francisco. I used to take the train downtown but it's not walkable any longer. Michael has some excellent information and suggestions. There is much food for thought in this book. I recommended it highly if you feel puzzled about what is happening in a progressive state like California.,5.0,1,2021
Great introduction to a fascinating historical character.,"Not sure how The Flower Boat Girl showed up in my search for an ebook copy of War and Peace so I could make my umpteenth attempt to read Tolstoy’s work, but I am so very glad it did. I’d never heard of Zheng Yi Sao, aka Ching Shih, (Shek Yang, later Cheng Yat Sou in the book because author Larry Feign uses the Cantonese versions of her names rather than the transliterated Mandarin which is standard in the West)  but she was sold into prostitution, captured by pirates, forced to marry one, yet became the most successful and powerful pirate who ever lived. No, seriously: Blackbeard, Captain Kid, Sir Henry Morgan… rank amateurs compared to Madam Cheng. This book covers the time of her capture and first, forced, marriage to pirate captain Zheng Yi (Cheng Yat).<br /><br />Feign, who has lived in Hong Kong for years does an excellent job of bringing her story to vivid life with evocative prose and a lively narrative style. He’s done his research and seamlessly creates the world of the pirates of the South China seas in the opening years of the nineteenth century in which to immerse his readers. The novel hits the ground running, opening with the raid in which Shek Yang is captured. She is no wilting maiden or damsel in distress: she’s a scrappy fighter which attracts Cheng Yat’s interest, and has him instantly declare he’s taking her to wife. The fact that she’s beautiful doesn’t hurt. More importantly, she’s also very smart, and something of a visionary. She’s not thrilled with this marriage, but does come to terms with it and develops some affection for her husband. Better: their relationship develops into a partnership of mutual respect. Not without its arguments and rough spots, but still. By the end of it all, she has made her husband a rich man, and supreme commander of a federation of pirate fleets.<br /><br />I enjoyed The Flower Boat Girl a lot. As soon as I finished it, I signed up for the free copy of an omitted chapter. I eagerly await the sequel about the next years of Ching Shih’s life which, according to the histories I've searched out since buying this book, were even more exciting than the ones detailed here.",5.0,1,2021
"Too real to western readers, too fake to Chinese readers and people who know the real China","It is sad that literature can be very powerful in both positive and negative ways. When it is powerful in the wrong way, all of us pay a price for it. I welcome the ugly truth about our world artfully and honestly depicted in fiction, but disdain nitpicking some human pains and problems to paint them as a common life for a people and hint at the helplessness and evilness of the greater society.<br /><br />I can clearly see the writer's years of experiences as a western journalist (WSJ) based in China give her the materials for her stories. The problem is, western media have more or less always focused on the negative sides and problems of China, which is what she did, and by doing so she willingly or unwillingly misled the reader into a mindset of the western mainstream media. So, what do we learn from these stories? They boil down to all things negative - lack of freedom, repressive government, people being beaten by police, people wronged by the army/government/boss, and youngsters fight for freedom, etc. Oh, that hopeless feeling - sure, the roads and malls are fantastic but what is the point when they don't have freedom and human rights? Chinese people are wonderful people, we like them and feel for them. We just don't like the government and the system.<br /><br />Mind you, the government has the support of 90%+ of the people.<br /><br />The real China is quite different - it is vastly more complex, dynamic, and uplifting. Unfortunately we don't see from this collection of stories the uplifting part . Why is that important? Number one, that's the main trend and dominant theme in everyday Chinese lives. Number two, if all the books about China are like this book, then there will be more misconception of China amongst westerners and the ultimate price might be a nuclear war between the U.S. and China.<br /><br />The first story, Lulu, reminds me of the writer's limitation in her real-life experiences with everyday Chinese families. There are small details that are not believable. For example, in China people don't go out to buy flour and bean paste on the first day of Chinese New Year. They would have prepared everything before New Year's eve and spent the first few days of the new year visiting with relatives and friends or celebrating via endless meals and partes. There is always enough, or often too much, to eat during the CNY, so no need to go out to buy cooking materials.<br /><br />Another example is that the majority of Chinese netizens who use VPN to bypass China's Great Wall of internet are usually shocked by how biased, negative, and distorted western media's reporting on China is. As a result, they become a stronger supporter of the government of China if they were not one to begin with. Lulu using VPN to see more of the outside world and then turning into an staunch activist against the government is too unbelievable, and does not represent the reality.<br /><br />I don't deny that there are youngsters like Lulu in China. However, she is an odd one out; the young generations are nothing like her. Lulu might be one in a million, which does not automatically make her story worth-reading. Yes, everyone wants a more prosperous and free society, but they don't try to achieve that by rebelling and protesting. Instead, they try to change society for the better through hard work with real results. They think the country is in the right direction and the government has been doing the right thing for the most part in the last three to four decades. For people who have never been to China, they read this collection of stories and feel sorry for Chinese people's repressed lives and may even be inspired to do something for them. What do they do? They want to blame and change the CPC, which is counterproductive and dangerous when the government and the system is supported by 90% of the people.<br /><br />Let me leave you with what the protagonist said in Lulu, ""If this country were a vegetable, it would be a rotten, bitter melon."" Now you really feel sorry for Lulu and for the Chinese people, don't you? Don't be, because what you have read is only fiction. The real China is so different...",2.0,0,2021
Huge plot holes. Still a fun read,"I could have just loved this book for several reasons. It was pretty well executed, moves along at a nice pace and the story sort of defines ""summer beach read"". It's a interesting plot concept for sure. It's basically a fast read for a relaxed weekend. Unfortunately, the HUGE, glaring plot holes irritated me from the first chapter. And they got worse as the book rolled on.<br /><br />This adult woman is so useless that she doesn't understand that her dead husband's body has to picked up from the morgue??? Or a funeral home must be contacted. Nor does anyone know about survivor benefits for her minor child. Worse, this main character fails to even try to do these very basic things for herself. Then she allows her 16 year old child to dictate the future for them both with nary a second thought.<br /><br />Let's not ignore the fact that just 6 months after the death of the ""beloved"" husband, the main character is flouncing off with a new man. I just wanted to slap everyone in the book. Fortunately, I didn't waste money on this.",3.0,0,2021
Where would America be today had these warnings been heeded?,"The warnings from the Founders contained in this volume astound me for their vision that have been proven so correct hundreds of years later, and this just decades after forming this nation.<br /><br />These writings here are not for casual reading but to be read and re-read, highlighted and memorized.  I find myself yelling HA out loud as I read another nugget to my liking. Chapter 7 Tyranny was my favorite and sadly, true for these days.<br /><br />I like having all these quotes available in my arsenal for future reference.  My only negative and reason for my one star deduction is for the layout. I don't care for the Bible type verse numbers for each author and think they should be deleted. I would also have preferred that each writing be on a new line and then followed by the authors name.<br /><br />Sadly, the wisdom in this book has been around over two hundred years but has fallen on deaf ears. I wish for the America that was framed but with human nature being what it is, no one with power will voluntarily give it up for the good of our nation.  In a free society corruption is bound to breed by the selfish.  So here we sit reading these pages with heartache and frustration wishing the Founders Republic could have stayed the course.  I weep for my country but will fight to preserve our liberty until the day I die.<br /><br />PS<br />I would encourage you to read Our Sacred Honor by William Bennett. I found it had many more nuggets that this book but with it being much longer that was logical.  The writing of our founders are beautiful but difficult to comprehend since we don't read or write like that anymore.  After a while it's easier to understand but borders on being long winded compared to today.  Fortunately there is a comment written by Bennett preceding each letter.",4.0,1,2021
"More Dark and Less Abuse, Please","Let me say I had great hopes for this book. I read the blurb, I read the reviews, both good and bad. ""Dark"" to me means dub/con or non/con but written in a way that it is redeemable. BDSM means following the tenets of BDSM in a sex club. End of story.<br /><br />This book? Had none of the above. It did have abuse. It had public forcible sex and public humiliation.  And none of those things are defined as dark.  That's just abuse, plain and simple.  Since I've had this site refuse to post this review twice, I've had to clean it up, lol.<br /><br />The first 30% of the book had promise.  Then it fell apart at the wedding and honeymoon and never got it back. It was as if the author was saying, 'well she bit off more than she could chew and let me show you what will happen now.'  Despite the fact that it contained hot steam that is necessary for erotica, more than half of the book fell through.  If someone actually thinks that the actions in this book are performed in any sort of BDSM club, they are wrong. Yes, there are public scenes in BDSM clubs, but never without the knowledge and consent of the submissive, which this girl was NOT. You can't be a submissive if you never get a chance to refuse. You cannot be a submissive if you are never asked to consent. Someone needs to get a different view on things really fast, otherwise you are misleading readers into thinking that THIS is the BDSM lifestyle and it is not.<br /><br />The author first needs to try and redeem Soren because even to the end, he was a jerk. Then the other two need to get a backbone and stop following along behind his abusiveness, which they both acknowledge a dozen times in the book.  Then because there are people out there who are into public humiliation, public sexual activity, and other things that comprise a teensy corner of the BDSM community/alternative lifestyles, she needs to clearly define that abuse is non-consenting public humiliation, especially when the victim is crying her eyes out and will do anything to make it stop. I was truly wanting to strangle everyone in this book, both heroine and hero for the way she was treated, for no other reason than he was mad at someone else. WTG.<br /><br />The plot had a lot of potential. This could have been an MMF with lots and lots of fun goings on. Instead, it left a bad taste in my mouth and I hope the author is looking to re-write it.  Those of us who love dark know the differences and really want to have a book that goes dark and stays there, for a reason other than the H is ticked off and needs someone to take it out on.",2.0,0,2021
Unbelievably powerful stuff for my male gaze,"This book is a fun, incredibly well researched look at what drives our relationship problems, and provides a wealth of information on some possible solutions.<br /><br />This book showed up after looking through some books on parenting, and I was hooked by the title so I bought it for myself. I didn't know exactly what to expect, but our relationship was summed up pretty neatly right there on the front page.<br /><br />Folks, I could not put this book down for the life of me. My wife and I are going through a rough patch right now, and I saw a lot of our issues reflected back at me in here. There were some parts that really hurt to read, but sometimes I need to hear the hard truths.

Do NOT get the audible. You'll regret it.,"I was told by another author he had to try out to read his own book for audible.  Clearly, this was not the case here and it should have been. The author has an unapproachable demeanor about her and her voice is very stoic, flat and bored sounding and absolutely horrific to listen to. I can't attest to the book because I couldn't stand listening to her one more second and returned the book. I hope the publisher has someone professional redo the audio. What I did get through sounded like all the rest of the self help genre in this area with the author trying to push her own ""spin"" on how things should be, in a very deadpan and annoying narration. Again, in didn't get far. Please listen to a sample before grabbing the audible you'll think us later. I say us because I'm not the only one that couldn't stand the sound of her voice. there's a very good reason why some authors do not read their own books. It's just not a good idea.<br /><br />***Update: I read a good majority of the Kindle after returning the audio book. The Kindle went back too. Why? This book is filled with other people's research basically copy and pasted. She gives credit but it's most of her book. What she's teaching people about their childhood is dangerous and what she's writing is complete junk in between all of the studies that have been done by respectable people in the industry. I think this book could be dangerous if in the wrong hands. She has a lot of social media followers that make up the majority of these reviews and her new holistic teaching as she calls it is just outright dangerous and manipulating. And what work is there to do there's a couple sentences here in each chapter. Her writing is bad The only decent writing between again is what I assume was copying and pasting studies and other people's quotes. If you need a self-help guide this isn't it.

One of King's Best Novels,"I'm going to start of by saying that I think it's a real shame that the ""top"" (meaning having garnered the most ""helpful"" clicks by other reviewers) 4 reviews of BILLY  SUMMERS are all extremely short and strongly negative, criticizing, once again, the author's well known anti-Trump feelings. Many of the negative  ""reviewers"" state that they didn't even finish the novel, but quit reading and asked for a refund (That is a weird concept to me - I'd never consider returning a book because I didn't like it).  These are also highly misleading as ""top"" reviews, since in total, 1 and 2 star reviews comprise only 3% of the total, with 5 and 4 star reviews making up a remarkable 93% of over 11,300 reviews to date.  OK, enough of that.<br /><br />As is easily deduced from the professional (newspaper, periodicals etc.) excerpted reviews on the Amazon page, BILLY SUMMERS is very different from the usual horror/science fiction/fantasy that King is so well known for.  This one is a crime thriller about a paid assassin, the eponymous BILLY SUMMERS who is doing one last job before retiring for good at the age of 44.  A highly decorated Gulf War veteran who became a sniper in the Marines, Billy only takes on jobs where the intended target is a really bad guy.  He's still a murderer of course, but his complex moral code, made very clear in the first half of the novel when acting as his undercover identities for several months, he becomes incredibly popular with his new neighbors and their kids.  He's invited to dinners, hosts cookouts and becomes a monopoly legend, while waiting for the signal from his employers that the arrival of the target is imminent.<br /><br />One of the narrative devices that King uses is to have Billy's main false identity be that of a writer.  Eventually Billy decides to do it for real, and starts to write his history, from a horrible childhood through his time in Iraq.  This story within a story (sort of) was one my favorite pieces, as Billy slowly realizes that he is actually quite good at writing.<br /><br />The second half of the short (for King that is, around 520 pages) novel turns into a kind of road trip-buddy-love story that is quite beautiful, suspenseful and unputdownable. Enough synopsis, as the several twists and turns of this crime story that becomes a mystery as to why this target and who is really behind the hit is hidden until very near the end and deserve to be totally unspoiled.<br /><br />There is a brief and repeated callback to one of the creepiest happenings in one of King's most famous and popular novels in there somewhere, but aside from the nods to that older work, there is not the slightest hint of anything of the supernatural or occult, which is one of the reasons that I waited so long to read BILLY SUMMERS  in the first place.  My bad.  This is an outstanding piece of writing and plotting  all the way through.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended.<br /><br />JM Tepper",5.0,1,2021
well written,"Character-driven teen/preteen story about angels. Christianity is definitely in there, but not pushy, just as the ground of Sheena’s life. Sheena is an interesting person, at once strong for justice and caring about others, while also flawed and human. Her relationships with other kids are also outside the usual mode: she sees the cliques at school very clearly but also feels she shares something with all of them. She has few friends but lots of people she interacts with, and cares a lot for the little boy next door, while also sometimes wishing he’d leave her alone. It’s a more balanced portrayal than most, and her emotions and reactions  feel age-appropriate and right for who she is. The author walks a fine line very skillfully. My one con is the book feels a little slow. The mystery is introduced around the halfway point, which is a little late, and Sheena doesn’t really get much further than understanding there are unusual spiritual forces interested in her. I wish we’d gotten a fuller picture than that of what was happening before breaking for book two. I’ll read another one because I enjoy the author’s portrayal of Sheena, and hope that more happens in the next entry.<br /><br />A very small niggle that has nothing much to do with the story:<br />A Vow of Purity ceremony (a promise by a young girl to stay chaste before marriage, made to her dad) is mentioned early on and I thought, as I always do: “Why don’t evangelical boys take the same Vow of Purity to their moms? Isn’t a boy’s purity expected to be just as much a part of his faith as a girl’s is? And what better way to help remind a boy to respect women than by having him make a vow to his mother?” Doubt it will happen, but I really wish those expectations and promises were more balanced. . .",5.0,1,2021

Ups and Downs,"The ""ups"" first.  I always enjoy my visits to Nantucket courtesy of Ms. Hilderbrand. Having been to the island, I can visualize so many of the lovely spots she describes so well.  It truly is a trip to the beach.  I also find her characters engaging and memorable.  Their relationships, also, are complex and cause the readers to immerse themselves in the lives of her creations.  Vivi's family is a joy to meet and to travel with them through the troubles they face following Vivi's death. The major ""down"" for me was the vehicle used to tell the story - the Vivi and Martha thread. It seemed derivative to me, and I almost didn't read the book after the first chapter. But then I persevered and was captivated by the story. Another ""down"" was that everything turned out soooo rosy, and there were few surprises along the way. I still enjoyed my island visit, despite some negatives feelings about the book as a whole.",4.0,1,2021
"some interesting insights , but unnecessarily drawn out","If the book was edited with the safe amount of care that went into editing the preface, this could have been a much more enjoyable read.  Instead, the book jumps around various topics with no clear ""golden thread"" to tie these observations/interpretations.  This lack of narrative arc is made even more painful due to lack of a discussion focusing on ""so what?"" and what exactly is the ""sweet spot"".<br /><br />The premise is well articulated - some chosen types of suffering can lead to pleasure later, life with ""meaning"" is better lived than one of pleasure, and some suffering is necessary to attain higher goals.  The subjectivity in all these statements is self-evident, but the author manages to explain that well.<br /><br />The initial chapters discuss various aspects of happiness/satisfaction/motivation using mostly other studies that have been used in the behavioral economics genre.  Discussion on motivational pluralism is particularly useful.  But the reliance on predominantly Western research and literature (and some of them from late 1800s) becomes very apparent in the discussion on ""opponent-process"" theory.  (Even secular readers of Eastern, particularly Buddhist literature, will be very familiar with the antidotes to various mental hindrances etc.  No reference is made to the Eastern philosophies rather than a few nods to Western interpretations of Zen and a pretty useless joke of a Buddhist vacuum without attachments).  From there, the author jumps to various kinds of fiction, allure of imaginative experiences like porn, effort etc.  While these chapters tend to provide some interesting observations, it takes quite a painful effort to plod through the second half of the book.<br /><br />In the end, a reader will still be searching for the sweet spot and will be not any wiser for knowing how to even find it.  3.5*",3.0,0,2021
"Lots of fun shops and interesting characters, I just love all those dogs they have","I'd recently read the prequel to this book and was eager to get into the series. I really enjoyed hearing about the small town, and along with her friends she already had from San Francisco, Harvey made a lot of new friends among the other businesses in St. Marin's...including a handsome mechanic. I thought it was so sweet of Walter and Stephen to come for the grand opening. They'd already experienced Harvey investigating one murder back in California, so they were super protective of her after this murder, as were Mart and Daniel. The sheriff in the town seems really nice and was very patient with Harvey. I like that he never yelled at her or made her feel that her info wasn't appreciated.<br /><br />I think I realized whodunit just about when Harvey did, but you know how cozies usually go when the sleuth names the killer, so I wasn't quite sure I believed her. But without anyone else in mind, I went with it to see how it played out. That was some showdown, gotta love that sweet dog Mayhem.

Mine between and among Caltech and the combined scientific communities and disciplines brought together under Jet Propulsion Labs projects just down the I-210 from where Lightman may have resided.<br /><br />I share 80% of Lightman's reflections and experiences. I do enjoy revisiting the domains of incomprehensibly large and small. It's a beauty best left inconceivable. Lightman's observation and a book meme that humans are positioned between nominally comprehensible powers of ±30 between atom and sun is an interesting metaphor. But let's be frank, man straddles the quantum, vastly smaller than the relative scale of the atomic and the universe, not simply our measly solar class.<br /><br />Alas, the gap is at least twice again the powers of vast large and small. Light from the universe hasn't yet reached us from 14-some B years ago. The universe will get larger in millions of years at the speed of c. Then again, I've not seen a better elucidation in layman's terms of vast than Lightman delivers. Kudo's to Lightman<br /><br />Lightman harkens back to Pascal frequently through the narrative. I imagined that Lightman might go the distance and embrace the scientific/philosophical Pascal universe. But, no. Lightman uses Pascal as a foil by the end. Lightman seems trite, announcing an error in Pascal's philosophy of science. His opinion. Many modern cosmologists won't mention Pascal for the reason. Lightman's universe is materialistic. That's shorthand for god-less. There is no room in Lightman's universe for another domain that many of us sense in our being.<br /><br />My favorite aspect was Lightman's firm belief that the Plancks are solid and unchanging. Just what I've been saying for years! So, I agree with Lightman. However, Lightman explains that unchanging Plancks in some concept supports the end state of multi-verse and string theory.<br /><br />Oppositely, I regard the Plancks unchanging existence as the very reason that multi-universe theories fail. However, all the propositions are untestable. No matter, multi-verse/string propositions 'yes/no' is moot in our existence. The propositions I've explored implicitly require the Plancks to metamorphose within the underlying mathematics to birth another universe. That's incomprehensible. Science rule #257: 'If it can't be imagined, even a tiny bit, on deep consideration, it can't exist. Oppositely, all that can be imagined could exist.' #257 has served me well.<br /><br />Though nearby in location, Lightman and I circulated in different circles. Lightman believes that only a slight minority of cosmology brethren discern a God among the irrationals and transcendentals. I'd guess far more have quiet regard for the otherness saturating the gap between science and perception of other and, unfortunately, I believe they do so for job security reasons. No matter again, God appears unmoved by popularity polls. I once supposed that mathematicians might be the most materialistic among the sciences due to precision, but I decided I was wrong after a deep discussion among them. Mathematicians must imagine and consider the transfinite in high order mathematics … Ω, ω, אּ. More than 'shorthand', there is a mystery here in the philosophy of mathematics despite materialist counterarguments.<br /><br />Lightman's godless universe feels incomplete. It's simply not satisfying. I liked it less and less as Lightman elucidates. Materialism answers none of the minds unique in all of known nature, human intuitions. ""Is there more to it?"" Lightman's search for proof of God will be fruitless. The transcendental nothingness of Buddhism is no shelter. 100-and-some-thousand Hindu gods are no help. No man can find God. God finds men, and men believe. It is an irresistible call. It's not a mystery at all.<br /><br />From 'Probable Impossibilities,' ""Spirituality does not require belief in miracles.""

Cliffhanger ending  :-(,"In this 9th installment of the Outlander saga, it is 1779, and the extended Fraser family is reunited on Fraser's Ridge in North Carolina. The action shifts up and down the Atlantic seaboard, as characters from past volumes reappear, die, are kidnapped, or are healed by Claire's medical knowledge, while new family members are born or adopted.

Trauma doesn’t excuse wrongfully convicting a man,"Her most popular book “The lovely bones” got a movie adaptation and earned Alice much praise. It also glossed over some weird & incongruent bits of the same book.  Her less popular book, “Lucky” , was going to do the same. Riding in the coat-tails of the success of “the lovely bones”, “Lucky” caught the eyes of netflix. This new adaptation was announced in 2019 but has probably been scrapped, for good reason. Most of the cast has dropped out. As it turns out, Alice Sebold wrongfully accused Anthony J. Broadwater of rape. He was exonerated November 22, 2021.<br /><br />  One of the producers, Timothy Mucciante, butted heads from the beginning. It began with disagreements in casting, specifically the assailant,  but grew with finding inconsistencies between the author, her book and what little information he could find online about her case. Eventually he was booted from the project. Timothy M., being trained as a lawyer had had previous experience with evidence as well as sexual assault cases, delved deeper into the holes in Alice Sebold’s stories. Not disbelieving her horrific experience, he wasn’t convinced that the court room proceedings had been fair or accurate. He hired a private investigator which got him in contact with Mr. Broadwater’s lawyer. The project was a catalyst for clearing a man’s name.<br /><br />Fastforward to now, its clear that many factors led to destroying the potential of one man’a life; The botched police investigation (rushed in nature), a traumatized young woman’s psyche, junk science and a lack of equity in the legal defense system. Mr. Broadwater lost more than time in prison. He lost employment opportunities. He was ostracized from society. He felt the need to forgo having children because of stigma, a regret he shared with journalists with his wife at his side, whom had always believed him. Unfortunately, as he said, it is now too late, the time for kids has passed.<br /><br /> Mr. Broadwaters has a go-fund-me and plans on suing Alice Sebold. She may have shared her own trauma but in doing so victimized a man and profited off his trauma. She slandered his name. She contributed to the suffering of an innocent man. She had even made a comment on the fact she didn’t want to be judged for being a white woman panicking at seeing a black man on the street, a statement now ironic in retrospect. This case highlights the inadequacies of all the levels our social justice system and our ingrained biases. Alice Sebold  has yet to comment at all.",1.0,0,2021
Read and set yourself free,"What a year we have had and there is still no foreseeable end to the insanity.  Several years ago I removed CNN from my station list. This year I terminated my decades long subscription to the Naples Daily News which is just a division of USA Today.  Local news is useful, to a degree for weather and the odd personal interest stories but the mute button is essential for the over-coverage of national and regional senseless crime.  If you want to stay connected to reality you would be well served by disconnecting from the MSM indoctrination.  God forbid if you have a child to send to college because, with few exceptions, these “institutions of higher learning” are nothing but socialist, Marxist and communist indoctrination centers.  So how does one stay sane surrounded by this compete insanity?  READ and research sources that will give you information that is unvarnished by political and philosophical bias.  My personal assessment of the vast majority of our nations residents is that we have become “fat and lazy” and prefer to have our information spoon fed without taking any steps to find truth.  Turn off your TV, listen to reputable voices who have earned your trust through verifiable research, and pray.  Our country is in deep trouble and we are less than 100 days into the farce of the Biden presidency.

Another example of the world's dumbest human being as a character,"Good lord, another Isekai/harem tale about a barely functioning mouth breather who would lose a game of tic-tac-toe against a dog.  This guy isn't just a little dumb, its very clear that if he tried to sit and chew bubblegum at the same time he'd fall out of his chair due to inattention.<br /><br />He's just that bloody stupid.<br /><br />But of course, that seems almost necessary as once again he's more powerful than the entirety of the Norse Pantheon as a group.  He could defeat Superman with just his pinky.  Well at least that's implied constantly without there being any good reason to back that up.<br /><br />Yes, I'm bashing this book.  One thing that I desperately want the authors of these Isekai/harem tales to do is twofold.<br /><br />First, smarten up the main characters.  Stop with the guys who do beyond stupid things without thinking about what might happen.  In this book after already getting sent to a new world because he touched an object in a room he had been repeatedly told not to enter.  [and I won't get into the stupidity of his janitorial job at an archeological site, that's a whole different idiocy that this author inserted.]  But after that, and having multiple people get on his case for things that the person in the body he was swapped into did before he arrived, he then attempts a magic spell without having any idea what it might do.  In a crowded cafeteria.  Using a magic source that he had no training in using.<br /><br />Can we say massive disaster?<br /><br />And that brings up the second major issue with this and so many other Isekai/harem tales.  Why is this guy so bloody powerful.  I put in a recent review that part of why people like a movie like Die Hard isn't that John McClane is some uber-human capable of great feats.  instead he's an everyman who struggles and is bloodied throughout the movie, but in the end is able to win thanks to grit, determination and a little bit of luck.  Here, the main character Jake shows no grit or determination, and his successes seem to be based on the fact that he's got access to so much power that he'd have to try to fail.<br /><br />And I hate to say it but that's boring beyond belief.  This guy isn't going to have challenges to meet, but some speed bump type obstacles and then the clothing will go flying.  Its readable, but its nothing that I really enjoy or find interesting.<br /><br />And yet, I keep trying out stories in this genre, because the few good ones are amazing.  Sadly, this tale and author are one and done for me.  His inability to break from the trend of poorly written Mary Sue type characters who are stupider than your average worm and yet more powerful than they need to be just left me saying.  ""I read it.""<br /><br />I give it 3 stars for being decently edited and flowing fairly well, but I'd say that unless you like the genre, its not worth your time.",3.0,0,2021

"Fun, refreshing, sexy Urban Fantasy","Look, this isn’t going to be a long review or a particularly in-depth analysis on character arcs and plot. Why? BECAUSE THIS REVIEWING MALARKEY IS KEEPING ME FROM BOOK TWO!<br /><br />Alexis is a tough cookie. Not particularly powerful (yet)…no secret ninja abilities. No vomity Insta-love with hot n sexy Kieran, the demigod. She’s REAL. A diamond in the rough. She’s poor, fashionably challenged (due to lack of funds), and she’s foster mom to two freaking hilarious teenage wards, one of whom is a sickly shifter by the the name of Mordecai. She’s fluent in sarcasm—my kinda woman—and sharp as a tack. The dialogue alone was 5 stars! Daisy, though, ward number two, has to be my favorite character. That bish is a prickly little spitfire with a potty mouth that’ll make a sailor blush. I love her!<br /><br />The plot, though. Hmm, not much of one, to be honest. But it’s still a fun, refreshing, unique read. Book One is mostly just setting the stage and gives you some insight to the characters. From what I’ve heard, the preceding books are where the real action and plot development happen. I don’t care, though, it was still super fun to read! Can’t wait to dive into the next installment.",5.0,1,2021
Victorian soap opera,"It’s hard to know what to say about a book when the author creates well developed characters that fall on the scale from unlikable to loathsome.  Such is the case with Hooks & Eyes set in mid-Victorian era England, where women are little more than chattel to be acquired, ordered about, used to whatever advantage, and then alternately adored or ignored as the father, brother, or husband sees fit.<br /><br />Such is the case with the female protagonist, Mary.  I can honestly say that I have seldom disliked a female main character as much as Mary.  To me, she seems very weak of character with ideas of what she wants but clueless about how her actions sabotage her own happiness.  There were a couple of times that she developed a backbone but those were fleeting.  Indeed, with the exception of a couple of spinster aunts, all the female characters are much like Mary.<br /><br />Mary’s husband William Weathers is also a piece of work as the stereotypical Victorian husband.  He is controlling, conniving, unfaithful, and manipulative. His wife, as with all women, are there to cater to his needs.  However, the author also has him engage in periodic self-reflection and symbolic self-flagellation.  This seems to have little overall effect because he very soon goes back to being an ass.  I got whiplash from it.<br /><br />Bottom line, this book reminds me of a sudsy, soap opera version of Andrew Wareham’s beautifully researched Poor Man at the Gate series.  The difference?  Wareham’s characters though flawed, are much more driven and relatable as they deal with the pitfalls of changing life and society beginning in the late 1700s.  Author McBeath’s characters are almost cartoonish in their deviousness and I had great difficulty whipping up much in the way of sympathy for any of them.  To reiterate, this is a Victorian era soap opera and like modern televised soap operas, I frequently find myself wanting to ask the characters, “What the hell is wrong with you?”",3.0,0,2021
I'm struggling to get into this,"Well.  I think I've noted in another review that cultivation stories have a nasty ability to dehumanize every character.  And.......<br /><br />This book does that at a level I really had not expected.  The ""hero"" is not heroic at all, and actually does some things that I'd say are outright villainous.  But the plot and the world force him into that situation again and again.<br /><br />Worse, even though there are other characters, they don't really matter except as plot devices.  Our hero barely talks to anyone and has no real close relationships due to the nature of the sect he is forced to join.<br /><br />Its not a story I can rightly label ""bad"", but I already know that I have little to no interest in continuing to read the series.  I want characters.  I want heroes that are heroic, not ones who set up what amounts to a snake oil shop in the middle of a combat zone and plays fighters against each other just to gain power.<br /><br />Just not my cup of tea.",3.0,0,2021
Wonderful book that might well help me create an album or other works of art:),"I am very fascinated with understanding the school system and the potential to create satire from a deep and thorough felt understanding along with my own experience. Thomas's book is wonderful at showing me simply and factually what I recall from my childhood. There is a memory of me trying to tell my parents that the school system was crazy and them being completely resistant towards my plea.<br /><br />After graduating and doing a couple years in college, the feeling of this system being mad has only increased. I've now been on a journey, reading many books, watching films and looking at others art who all find the system to be the definition of insanity and in a world where none dare call out the 'angles' who all run the system. What am amazing opportunity we have to acknowledge this unconscious circus of misery that we thrust all the youth into without being able to talk of its origins or how it functions. This is an artists dream come true...although we all had to go through the nightmare to recognize it as such.<br /><br />Thomas brings a most wonderful and thorough look at the deceitful system which is now harming our most precious responsibility, outside of our own enlightenment; the wise guidance of our children.<br /><br />I am glad that there are enough of us to take heed this inner call to find just how perverse this wicked torture instrument we have allowed to grow, like a weed, from a system that was once much more honest and simple and that churned out many more entrepreneurs, artists and self sufficient people with values, critical thinking ability and wisdom;...instead of hipsters, troubled kids and often at best mediocre people who will slave for comfort and safety without ushering forth that unique spark that is in each of us which alone is fulfilling. We have kids looking to be hero's now because they are taught the collectivist jive that the loser professors, like the parasites they are, brought with them. But I think there is a silver lining and we can all have a huge laugh as we each begin to recognize this and create an artistic explosion in a world that tries to censor and condemn anything that is not PC. All of the books and talks Thomas gives helps me to be a better artist and enables me to make mind balm from his very insightful deep looking at vital issues that are falsely handled by the entrenched elite and a legion of hipsters who are just looking for something to give their all to...but who are misguided to the extreme; I was one of them:)",5.0,1,2021
Nubia as a Young Black Girl,"As you can see from my avatar, I'm a huge fan of Storm.

Also being a fan of Wonder Woman, discovering that Diana had a twin sister who was Black just cemented my lifelong love of comics. #Representationmatters beyond the box of ""accepted"" ideas of Blackness.<br /><br />With that said, what would life be like for a young Black girl with superpowers in this day and age of police brutality, sexual harassment and racism. How would a gifted and caring Black girl navigate life while everything she does is viewed and misconstrued through the lens of race?<br /><br />Nubia just wants to be a normal teenage girl but knows she isn't. She has powers she doesn't understand and in using them for the most benign reasons causes people to view her with even more suspicion. She and her mothers have to relocate in order to avoid unnecessary attention. However, the moves and the rules her parents have set for her brush up against Nubia's desire to help, especially when it comes to her friends. She has moments where she gets to be a typical teenager with friends and a cute boy crush.<br /><br />I'm hoping this will be an ongoing series.

Can not explain the melancholy...,"It was a good book. Well written, edited, story was cohesive and well developed but for whatever reason it left me incredibly sad.<br /><br />Spoilers to follow:<br /><br />The amount of hurt that Cat held could only be explained by a couple of scenarios. The fact that Kellan is still alive only left a failed marriage/elopement to cause so much anguish that many years later. To have him show up, out of the blue, ready for her to just take him back (with a tosh of angsty hemming and hawing on his part) irritated me. Really?

Didn't interest me enough to get anywhere near the cliff-hanger ending.,"As the beginning of a story, this one ends in a cliff-hanger. Despite the stranger breaking into Isabelle's home at the point of a knife, there was little intensity projected by the author. At no point did I feel that Isabelle was in danger, thus how could any angst have been experienced? I was soon skimming through the story in boredom, and because it didn't hold my interest, deleted it at the 35% mark. Author execution includes quite a few short sentences presented in sequence as if each represented a separate paragraph.  This artificially extends the length of what is a partial book to begin with (parts of a story presented in a series rather than providing an entire story in one book---one having a beginning, a middle, and an end).  This ""book"" lacked both depth and an engrossing story, and seemingly was just an author attempt to quickly get the beginning of the next story published to continue the income chain.  Where are the well-crafted, complete romance novels, which many, many authors did so well in the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's?",2.0,0,2021
"Good certainly, but far from comprehensive; boron does much more for us!","It's true the mineral boron is a Godsend, but it's just not researched or studied nearly enough because there's no way to patent a natural mineral (no massive profits via exclusivity from a patent). This good book provides a glimpse into how important boron is to humans, but it's just too short to earn my full praise. There's a reason for this though, the pharmaceutical industry has made 110% sure that helpful info on boron is scarce. I take a healthy dose of boron daily in my water and via multivitamin-multimineral daily, and I can tell you, it's made a world of difference over the last five years.

For example, although the ""ley lines"" were disgustingly covered ad nauseum in the last book, again the reader is bored to utter frustration by another discourse of such.<br /><br />A second chapter that I definitely didn't want nor need to be subjected to was a very lengthy discourse on Catholicism. Again, great for word count, interesting only to those who want a Cliff's Notes version of the Catholic church and religion. I wanted to read an interesting storyline. Instead, I just got bogged down until I again ended up just skipping the entire chapters.<br /><br />This book dragged on and on, going off subject too often.

"Books With Timely, Profound Messages","In this charming book by Sara Nisha Adams, a mysterious benevolent presence has left elegantly handwritten lists of eight books in seemingly random (but maybe not) places where the notes might be found by persons who are going though rough patches in life and who might find just the appropriate and timely messages of encouragement in the titles recommended.  From ""The Life of Pi'"" a person might find courage. From ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" a reader might find wisdom and empathy.  From ""Rebecca,"" someone might find how to move on from past relationships.  Each of the eight books could help a different reader in a unique way.  The characters are intriguing.  A beautiful friendship develops between a 17 year-old girl working a summer job in a local library in the United Kingdom and an elderly widower. Both are working their way through challenging life events.  The man's wife has only recently died, and the girl and her brother serve as caretakers for their mother who suffers from mental illness. I love the way author Sara Nisha Adams made the lessons in the books so relevant to the needs of the readers.  Although it was heartwarming to read, I must admit I have never experienced books in such a visceral way as do the characters in this book.  It made me feel like I am missing something special.

Another part of the book compares what happened in a tv movie about Gloria Vanderbilt vs what really happened.  I don't care what happened in the movie.

A mix of metaphysics and management consulting disguised as science,"The book presents a new explain-all concept, “frame”. The authors do not present a formal definition of this concept, but following the examples in the book, it seems that in many cases frames refer to theories about the world and in some other cases they refer to patterns of behavior.<br />The authors claim that robots cannot implement frames since frames are based on revealing causes, considering counterfactuals, and considering relevant constraints, tasks that robots cannot do. I failed to find a convincing argument for these claims. Indeed these concepts are under dispute, mainly among logicians and philosophers of science, but it is possible to program the theories in this field, such as Lewis or Stalnaker accounts of counterfactuals, and to implement them in robots.  And on a higher level of argumentation, since people understand the concepts of causes and counterfactuals, and since our brain is a physical machine, then the idea that robots cannot implement these concepts leads to the conclusion that we have a non-physical soul on top of the brains. Welcome to 17th-century metaphysics.<br />The second part of the book lists suggestions about creating successful frames. The book recommends that people and companies increase the diversity and the pluralism of the ideas that they consider, but the book ignores the practical problem: how should we filter out stupid ideas when we don’t have enough time to consider all the ideas that other people suggest.<br />One minor additional point: the authors keep quoting Yuval Noah Harari. For example, on page 79 they praise his idea: “You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey haven.”  Obviously, this idea is trivial. And indeed, most of Harari’s ideas are either trivially true or trivially false. And when The Economist reviewed Harari’s Home Deus (and referred to Sapiens as well) on Sept 15th, 2016, it was one of the few journals that criticized Harari’s books: “Mr. Harari has a tendency towards scientific name-dropping—words like biotech, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence abound—but he rarely engages with these topics in any serious way. Instead, he races along in a slick flow of TED-talk prose. Holes in his arguments blur like the spokes of a spinning wheel, giving an illusion of solidity but no more. When the reader stops to think, “Homo Deus” is suddenly less convincing, its air of super-confidence seductive but misleading.” Now, the first author of the current book, Kenneth Cukier, is a senior editor in The Economist. Perhaps, he used the current book to “compensate” Harari (but in my opinion, The Economist’s original criticism of Harari was quite valid).<br />Still, the book is well written and includes many stories about interesting scientific experiments and decisions taken by various companies. I enjoyed very much reading these case studies.",3.0,0,2021

Mind numbing amount of detail & TMI on physical attraction,"The author has really REALLY fleshed out this world & her characters. I was only slightly aware of the fairy tale this is based on, but it turns out it's exactly the plot I thought it was, with the main female being really irritating & being pig headed the whole time she continues in the path of stupid, so I don't really see how this is anything but a retelling, just with more & I mean MORE details. Details about dresses, food, naked goblins running about with thier man parts dangling (while she eats dinner every night)-Ugh! TMI. Then there's her dress making & exploration of the FAE land. Mind numbing. The story swings the other way when the lead female starts lusting after the shadow man-wow-I so don't care to hear about that in detail. I pretty much felt dirty when she started seducing him & just skipped to the end & oh! surprise the story ends with her deciding she's going to try to save shadow man. Ho-hum-why do I care ? I mean YES someone save him, but can we have her just leave the story already ? whatever he paid for her, she's not worth it. in a nutshell: Tedious in that it kept the original storyline. Too much details & unpleasant female lead character. Waste of money",2.0,0,2021
That Mona Lisa Smile,"Leonardo da Vinci’s Renaissance masterpiece is the most recognizable piece of art, worldwide. A portrait of the wife of a wealthy Italian silk manufacturer would become an icon, both famous and infamous. What is it about this particular portrait that stirs us so? Is it the skill of the brushwork of the artist? Is it her enigmatic smile? Something more?<br />Laura Morelli’s book,  “The Stolen Lady”, a work of historical fiction, begins in Renaissance Italy, with Leonardo Da Vinci. We learn about many of his inventions, ideas, and his dreams of being remembered. Then he is contracted to paint a portrait of the wife of a wealthy silk merchant. The artist would work on this one painting for the rest of his life.<br />Next, in a split-timeline narrative, it is 1939;  Paris, France. We meet Anne, a typist within the Archives of the Louvre Museum. In details taken from real life, we follow Anne and a group of employees of  “Musée du Louvre,”  we see- decades later -how the priceless works of the Louvre are carefully kept out of Nazi hands. And what a journey this would be! Six years. Six separate moves. Will they be found (or worse) by German soldiers? Will they be able to hold on to the art? Will they survive??<br />This is an exceptional read, particularly if you’re interested in da Vinci; the Renaissance; the Mona Lisa; WWII & the Resistance. I loved it!!!",5.0,1,2021
I guess this is fiction now,"Sad and disappointing to the end. I heard such great things about Reid and this book, and I'm left wondering where the rest of this book wound up. As a book exploring a woman's sexuality, its not very sexy. As a book about a longtime actress, it spends a lot of time talking, not showing real life for an actress. As a book about a woman with seven husbands, the chapter titles as punchline ruins the point of the chapter about the husband... if you're just going to reduce the character to a punchline, you don't need them in your book. Was this book supposed to be about Evelyn? An annoying conceit in the book were the tabloid excerpts. It really took me out of the rhythm of the story just as it was starting to build some energy. As a book about a murder mystery, it very easily glossed that over without a second thought. I wish the author had put all of the focus on trying to survive life in the closet for decades for these characters instead of adding six more plot points to flesh out the book. I think a huge opportunity was missed just unpacking the harrowing journey so very many LGBTQIA+ people have experienced, especially what life was like for so many men living and dying during Reagan's tenure of denial. Even Stonewall was glossed over, and Harvey Milk's life and death wasn't even mentioned. I had hoped that there would be more than a mention of these high profile events in the LGBTQIA+ community because they have led to some progress over the years. There was no mention of why Celia told Evelyn she could lose her daughter in the 90s, which I think was a very important point to mention if you're writing about life in the community. If an author is bridging a gap, they should certainly pay tribute to the people who lost their loves and their lives fighting for rights today...but there was no mention. There are still people fighting against the LGBTQIA+ community and their right to exist RIGHT NOW, but that wasn't mentioned either. What a colossal disappointment.<br /><br />The truly sad thing about ""new"" fiction is that it feels so sloppy and disconnected, like a tweet thread instead of a story with heart and guts and real soul. I'm convinced that all one has to do to be a writer now is phone it in. The editors aren't tough, the publishers are desperate for content, and the story doesn't really matter cuz you'll get published anyway and most people read at a fifth grade level anyway.",2.0,0,2021
Charming cozy mystery,"First, an extra big thanks to the author for offering the Kindle edition free right now. I love being able to sample new-to-me authors' works this way. This book was a winner — so much so that I immediately bought the second book in the series as soon as I finished this one.<br /><br />The clever title caught my eye immediately. This is a charming cozy mystery, well crafted (including that oh-so-essential quality editing), set in a lovely small town where everyone not only knows your name but also what you had for dinner. The characters were nicely developed (I'm sure I know several of them), and the who-dun-it kept me guessing. I really appreciate the way the author wove history into her setting, and I loved the list of suggested readings she included as an afterword.<br /><br />The dogs (and Aslan the cat) were strong supporting characters who naturally nudged the humans out of the way and basked in the limelight themselves a time or three. Being a dog person, I was delighted to see that the author knows her dogs! She wove their personalities into the story seamlessly, providing an extra layer of comfortable reality to the experience.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.",5.0,1,2021

Loved Sophie and Cox,"I am a long-time Claire Kingsley reader, so I know that I can always expect a high-quality rom-com with some serious laughs, but even readers now to Claire will know that they are in for a very funny read when the book starts off with the female lead accidently going commando in a short dress and then meeting the male lead mid-bedsheet-dangling-getaway from a second story balcony.<br /><br />Marrying Mr. Wrong is the 3rd book in the Dirty Martini Running Club, but each book is a standalone so you do not need to read them in order. I suggest you do, though, because they are such great characters and close friends that appear in each of the books.<br /><br />We met Sophie Abbott in the prior books, and she is an accident-prone bundle of positivity and sunshine. I've loved Sophie since we first met her, so I'm glad that she gets her HEA here. Cox, her soul mate, is actually known to her, but she hasn't seen him since they were kids. Sophie does NOT have fond memories of Cox, but he has very fond memories of her. Classic boy-likes-girl-but-shows-it-by-pulling-her-pigtails behavior. From the minute Cox is reunited with Sophie, he is enchanted. She's sweet, sassy, beautiful and so genuine. Cox is a confirmed bachelor with no plans of marrying ever, but he can't resist Sophie at all.<br /><br />Claire gives us so much heart and humor on the road to their happily-ever-after that this is just a pure joy to read. Fun, flirty, plenty of heat and tons of humor. This is the kind of rom-com that stays with you, and has you coming back for re-reads because it's just such a pleasure to read and enjoy.",5.0,1,2021
A fun classic cozy mystery novel,"I enjoy mystery novels, mostly classic mystery novels but also some police procedural mystery novels, especially those from other countries. (It is like traveling the world without making horribly long airplane trips. ) I enjoyed this one very much.<br /><br />I like the main characters. Tommy and Evelyn are a sweet couple who clearly love each other and incorporate a sense of humor in their marriage. Despite previously serving in the police,  they are amateurs and not trained in detective work. They both exhibit believable puzzle solving logic ability. Aunt Em is a likeable crusty spinster, also with a sense of humor.<br /><br />I figured out that  someone was killing the inheritance line to the Earl's title but not the motive for the killer...I was expecting something more like the movie ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and not the motive in this book. (Even though there were ample clues. I must have a blind spot or be rusty at solving mysteries since not reading very many the past year.) This is not as complex as an Elizabeth George ""Inspector Lynley "" novel or a Louise Penney or Charles Todd novel.<br /><br />I know editing is hard work. I do not go hunting for editing errors but I do stumble over them when reading...they cause me to stop reading because I do not skim, I read every word. I have to metaphorically pick myself up off the floor after stumbling. I have also noticed lately, mostly in ebooks but even in paperbacks and hardcover books being published in recent years, more typos and other errors than I find in older books. Maybe today's editors are being severely unpaid per book and rushing through manuscripts they edit. Or maybe working with digital copies makes errors more common than working with traditional paper manuscripts (handwritten or typewriter pages). So yes, there were errors in the text that I hope will be corrected in future editions and future books in this series.",4.0,1,2021

"Go in blind, they said","I hate when reviews say to go in blind, because here’s the thing: I like spoilers. Love them, in fact. I want all the details so I can know if a book is worth my time.<br /><br />However, after reading this Little Lies, I can honestly say the blurb is all you need to know. If it doesn’t pique your interest, then you probably won’t enjoy this book. The only ""spoiler"" I found in the review was that this was paranormal. I know…not much of a spoiler.<br /><br />Hints were sprinkled here and there throughout the book, but it wasn’t until 85% or so that I caught on to the big reveal. Maybe I’m slow…I don’t know. I was correct in my early assumptions about some supporting characters, but that’s for you to figure out on your own.<br /><br />I like dark books, but the violence in this one kinda turned my stomach towards the end, if the grimace on my face was anything to judge by.

Not the complete series!,"This is a good story, though not as good as the author’s Alpha Plague series.  The main issue I have, and the reason for the 2xstar review, is this isn’t a complete series.

Excellent,"Some authors have the winning recipe for writing great thrillers. The stories are gripping and keep the reader intrigued and turning pages. The twists when then they come are surprising but not implausible and the pace of revealing information is on point. Freida McFadden remains one of my favourite authors for ticking all these boxes and Do Not Disturb, her latest thriller does not disappoint. Quinn arrives home early and surprises her good-looking, super rich but equally cruel husband who was expecting to meet up with someone else in their home. They get into a physical altercation and she stabs him. Without thinking things through she goes on the run during a very bad snow storm and thus begins a fast, fabulous story. 5 Stars.",5.0,1,2021

*Twenty-something Wunderkind Genius Jack’s Britannic-esque Space Naval Adventures*,"“Violent Graduation: Jack Foster Space Opera Series,” Book 1, details at length, wunderkind genius Jack’s ‘adventures’ entering his Britannic-esque space naval career, starting with his troubled travels to a Hogwarts-type pseudo naval (sans ‘magic’) space academy, his troubled times there, and his troubled times following his graduation.<br /><br />‘Trouble’ is the underlying plot device throughout for young man Jack’s storyline. Being from a wealthy, connected family, a genius, and the upper class VIP connections made along his way, saves Jack time after time after time.<br /><br />It’s not horrible, it’s not very good either, and somewhat surprisingly, not a teen/YA story.

Reunited and it feels so goooood!,"The gang is back and all together at last! I have missed Reagan, Penny, Charity, and their guys so dang-a-lang much! I know I’ve raved about each of the books in the series, and it was deserved, but this book brings it up a notch. I didn’t think it was possible.<br />In this book we get to visit the Brink to see Reagan's super secret training island, travel the Realm to visit the Warrior Fae and meet the Elves, and an insightful peek into Lucifer's underworld.<br />When I say the gang is together I truly mean every single character we’ve loved (and hated) is in this book!! Reagan is in top form, funny, feisty, and fighting. Darius is dreamy and uber protective. Cahal the Druid is a freaking rockstar and I’m so glad we got to learn more of his story. Penny continues to amaze us with her ability to make up swear words. Emery just loves and supports her, and he definitely cracks me up. Karen and the Red Prophet meet, now that’s a team I would NOT bet against. Red is hilariously crazy and should not be left alone, especially with Reagan's neighbors! No Good Mikey may never recover LMAO. Callie and Dizzy are quite the troopers, and are going strong. Vlad is still playing the roll of Creepy Stalker #1. There are demons everywhere. Charity and her dad get it done! Romulus needs to see to believe but once he does he’s all in. Reagan is at her finest when in the Flush, I’ve never laughed so hard. The Warrior Fae are BACK! Devon and his expanded pack are there, backing up Charity and kickin' butt furry style. Roger, whom I love, finally picks a side.  We meet the Elf Royalty, and as you can guess it went really well LOL. Ja makes a quick but important appearance. And last but not least we get a peek into Lucifer's head. We now know who Reagan got her attitude from!<br />We get POVs from multiple characters which is awesomesauce! Because of that we got to experience what was going on throughout, there were no blanks to be filled in later, we saw it all firsthand. I was never confused as to who's POV it was. They all definitely have distinct ways of thinking and speaking!<br />I cannot stress enough that you need to read these books! You get laugh out loud humor and all the feels. It’s a modern take on an epic fantasy series. They are so well written, I get completely immersed in the world KF Breene has brought to life. Each book is a needed escape from reality. It is, hands down, my favorite series.",5.0,1,2021

Insightful & Inspiring.  Women Strong,"I view Jennifer Rubin as brilliant and a fierce patriot trying to ensure that fascism does not take hold in our country.  Her breadth and depth of knowledge are astonishing.  How did she learn this much about history and politics and the human condition?<br /><br /> I, too, am an American woman who did not sit by idly while Donald Trump and his ilk tried to pull down our democracy.  In my little ways, I fought back, apparently along with millions of other American women, including African American women who similarly see through the glass clearly.  I realize now, proudly, that we are part of the resistance intent upon saving democracy for our children and grandchildren.  The Resistance.  Yes, that is us, no matter how small our contribution--votes, attitudes, conversations that espouse our values.<br /><br />The author reaffirms what we know:  If our democracy is replaced with an authoritarian form of government, our children and grandchildren will live impoverished and without freedoms we take for granted.<br /><br />Democratic rule has its corruptions but the good generally triumphs before too much evil prevails.  Authoritarian governance begets more evil than good.<br /><br />I especially appreciate Rubin’s insights, historical perspective, and understanding of how  governments work.  She grasps to the bone the dangers posed by authoritarian rule driven by fascist ideology.  I love her interviews of women with power and intend to re-read to savor sections I breezed through.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this book:  The title itself, because America has not actually been saved from Trump.  The 2020 election merely gave us a reprieve from his dominance.  We did good, collectively, in 2020, but our work must go on, as Rubin duly notes.  Our country still needs us.",5.0,1,2021
"In a word, horrible!!!","I have never read an author of history worse. The first 40 pages are telling the reader what you will read, how you should read it, and why you really can’t comprehend world history as taught by anyone else. It goes downhill from there. A good editor should have caught the multiple ‘as we said in the last chapter’ or ‘as previously stated.’ The royal We is used everywhere. It is condescending and overblown. The author spends pages on The Big Bang after explaining ‘we’ (I am unsure if he means the reader or humankind) just can’t comprehend what happened. But he pulls some lovely graphics from NASA exploring it nonetheless. After almost 100 pages, I quit. I try very hard to give any author at least 1/3 of a book to get his kinks straightened out but this was not worth the brain cells I was frying.<br /><br />Btw, before anyone tries to defend this mess, my degrees were in History and English. And while it has been many years since grad school - if any professor I took had tried to pass this pile of dog  ****** off as a text book, the students would have left in mass after just attempting to read the prelude.<br /><br />Poor writing, way too wordy and rather unsure of the subject. Not worth your time. But the graphs are excellent.  Lol.",1.0,0,2021
My least favorite of the series so far,"This is Hattie and Axl's story, which I was anxious to get to.  I have really enjoyed the first two books in this series, and at the end of the last one, Axl witnessed Hattie self-harming while dancing, and that set up this story beautifully.  Hattie is a dancer in Smithie's club (which is now a revue rather than straight stripping), and Axl's is one of Hawk's commandos.  Nobody writes sexy and appealing badasses like KA, and Axl was no different.  Also typical of a KA book, the heroine realized quickly that she was messing up royally with the hero, and she pulls her head out of her ass quickly.  That said, there were a couple of major problems I had with this book.<br />1. Axl dated another woman while he was into Hattie, and they are still good friends.  One of the first things he says to Hattie when they begin dating is that he hopes she isn't the type of woman to get jealous of women friends.  Hattie also mentions later that they text a lot.  Okay, first off, this is not a woman friend.  This is an ex.  Big difference.  One of Hattie's girls even says ""He's probably been inside her.""  I mean, ugh.  It just made me uncomfortable.  He even mentions another woman he's had sex with that occasionally texts him.  No.  Just, no.<br />2. Hattie has an emotionally abusive father (he called her a whore and actually backhanded her once), and she goes over to his house every night to make him dinner.  Axl goes over with her, has this big epiphany that he loves his daughter and is just expressing it in an f-ed up way, and he and Hattie begin taking her dad places and spending time with him (I guess in a non-dysfunctional way?).  And poof!  It's all better!  I'm sorry, years and years of abuse is not justifiable in any way, and a toxic relationship like that is not changed miraculously overnight.  Once again, no.  Just, no.",3.0,0,2021
Total garbage,"I have read many of Stephen King's books and enjoyed them.  This book, however, would have made it in the trash had I purchased it.  Fortunately, I downloaded it from our local library.  This was slow moving and boring.  Furthermore, I am sick of Mr. King shoving his political views down our throats.  I don't care what they are no more than he cares what mine are. He hates Trump.  The whole world knows it by now.  He seems to think it is all right to insult the 70 million people who voted for Trump.  That's it.  I am finished with him.  I'll never read any more of his books.

Deeply cathartic little trot,"I was really interested to see Chuck Tingle departing from the usual fun, lightweight levity that makes all of his erotica so enjoyable and veer into horror. And I wasn't disappointed! This story still has Chuck's relentless sense of optimism, faith and love for all queer people, but also doesn't flinch away from openly being exhausted and frustrated with the ugly side of oppression. There's a lot of catharsis packed into seeing an author who normally makes loving, fun, lightweight work describe his protagonists' lack of guilt for bashing back. It's a short read, and incredibly transparent about its themes, but that's enjoyable, too! I'm so glad I picked this one up, thank you Mr. Tingle for proving love (and also that we're allowed to Be Angry)",5.0,1,2021

"There's not much ""there"" there...","First, I didn't finish the book. I stopped after JFK was brought to the hospital and died (and was essentially dead when he got there).  What I didn't like: Useless content about surgeons acting like college BMOCs, e.g. they were Gods and they knew it, and acted like Frat Party jerks. Second, the endless listing of supposed ""facts"" that were never proven, and just don't add up. The authors cited numerous accounts of supposed fake FBI agents milling all over the grassy knoll, yet ignoring eye-witness at the scene sightings of men with ""rifles under their coats"" and even seeing ""rifles pointed toward the limousine"". All of which were ""strangely"" ignored. If the area around the grassy knoll and the Book Depository building were full of that many clearly suspicious people no amount of FBI ignorance or malicious intent could have prevented it from coming out. Also, the inference that this was an inside job across a large segment of the President's own staff and appointees, some of which were on a plane overseas and magically someone forgot to put the ""Presidential Emergency Phone"" on the aircraft. And of course bringing in the Mob connection via Jack Ruby, and Kennedy's personal protection personnel getting drunk and staying up late the previous night while LBJ's team was in bed early.  Bottom line, there is clear intent by the Authors to turn this into a a sensationalized conspiracy account when there never has been, and never will be, conclusive evidence on that point. The point is, we as a country went through this ""conspiracy"" perspective for many years following JFK's assassination, and nothing has ever come of it, and at this point never will. Maybe he was killed by the mob, maybe LBJ played a part, but the fact is we'll never know. As another reviewer cited, I'm not sure I believe the Doctor's claim that the President was ""clearly shot from the front"", and that ""the autopsy photos were doctored to make it appear he was shot from the back."" After all that, I concluded that there was no use reading any more. The Doctor's only value-added was that he was ""the guy"" that was in the Trauma Ward when Kennedy was brought to Parkland, but his comments regarding those moments were nothing more than what any Trauma surgeon would reveal, and this headline on the cover is what sold the book. All the rest is either superfluous or questionable sensationalism.",2.0,0,2021

No happiness in the Midnight Library,"I purchased this book due to the amazingly high number of ratings. I began this book & remained open-minded to the initial chapter which began with “Nineteen years before she decided to do die.” Then it flipped to “Twenty-seven hours before she decided to die.” The next chapter began again with “Nine and a half hours before she decided to die.”It was a countdown… 8 hours, 7 hours. This wasn’t a great experience in reading a new book but I continued. I even went back to the beginning to scan the initial beginning to see if I missed something that led to these continuous headlines. The main character Nora in her 30’s lost both her parents, she ended a relationship that was close to marriage, she didn’t pursue dreams she had skills to achieve & to top it off to the current her cat was killed by a car (cats aren’t meant to be outside creatures if they have a home to live in), she was let go from a job she wasn’t even happy at & learned her Brother was in town who never bothered to contact her because their relationship was estranged. She perceived her life as a total loss. One night she took 2 anti-depressant pills & looked at the rest of the pills in the bottle & finished off a bottle of wine. She then decided to write a letter addressed to “Dear Whoever.” The clock struck midnight & the reader was left to believe Nora ended her life & where could this book possibly go now? Where did it go? Time stood still & she found herself in a library encountering her old school librarian who ultimately handed her a book. This book was filled with all of Nora’s life choices & ultimate regrets & what could have happened if she made a different choice. At this point I stopped reading. I, myself, regretted the time I invested reading this garbage. The author totally dismisses the severity of depression & took suicide with stride instead of the seriousness of it. With the way this book is written it leads the reader to believe that once you end your life there is a time between actual life & death to examine what went wrong with the opportunity to go back & change things. This isn’t reality & I find it disturbing this was a top selling book with an enormous amount of high ratings. In managing to get through the initial chapters how could people do it to actually get to the thick of the book which from reading from other reviews, is loved the most. The opportunity to look at your life, the choices made & the what ifs. More people are diagnosed with a mental health disorder currently & suicide rates are at their highest ever. To write a book of this nature is again disturbing. For so many people to have been moved & touched after reading this book is disturbing. I seriously can’t believe an author wrote a book that began the way it did. To get to the thick of the book, to have a main character find themselves in a library to learn about their life could have been written differently. For someone who suffers from depression and has contemplated suicide this book could be disastrous. For anyone who doesn’t but is familiar with mental health, it would be obvious this book wouldn’t be a could pick for them. It’s an utter shame this book is a top seller.

"Dark, Grim, and empty","Like so many stories I seem to find this story lacks any characters I wanted to cheer for.  The main character had potential, but tropes ruined that.  First despite her mother knowing that her daughter should have inherited great magical power there was a deliberate attempt to keep her daughter from truly knowing any magic.  Of course this ends up becoming the usual major plot point that was clearly designed to prevent cries of ""Mary Sue"", even though the trope of a child orphaned and never knowing the truth about who their parents are and what their inheritance might be is a clear sign that a Mary Sue character is likely.<br /><br />But not satisfied with that, the main character proves to have feet of clay and a perfect ability to stall her own actions long enough to fail time after time.  It was such a comedy of errors that was just not funny.  It was clearly thought to be a way to build tension, but for me it just generated a lot of boredom.  This kind of writing tends to remove a lot of the character and relationship development, and this story lacked both of those completely.<br /><br />Sadly that is the big thing I took from this tale.  It was just not what I was looking for and in the end I have to say that while some readers will definitely enjoy this, I cannot recommend it as I feel that the story does not live up to the promise built into the idea.",3.0,0,2021
Not at all convincing,"I read this with an open mind. It's not at all implausible that CIA + Mafia hitman were responsible for the murder of President Kennedy in 1963.  After reading this, however, I do not think that James Files was one of two hitmen he claims were recommended by Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana to the CIA. Nothing about his claim rings true.<br /><br />There are little things--like his saying Charles Nicoletti (another Giancana hitman) was firing from Dal Tex and Files was on the fence behind the grassy knoll--the only two gunmen in the plaza--that doesn't seem consistent with what several others observed in that fence area, including seeing a man with the false SS credentials who -wasn't- Files. He insists he was the only one involved in front of the car, in the ""grassy knoll"" (hillside with fence).  Also he didn't notice that SS driver Bill Greer slowed the car to a stop or near stop after the first shot, even though it would have made Files' shot so much easier.  And Files doesn't even remember seeing any shot to the President's throat--the first shot from the front, coming from the grassy knoll (i.e. from ""him"").  But these aren't the biggest problems.<br /><br />Files' description of interacting with Lee Oswald doesn't sound believable--and we know Oswald didn't drive, though Files has him zipping around in a Ford Falcon.  He barely mentions Jack Ruby--clearly mob-connected, including to the mobster Files was allegedly close to, Sam Giancana.  Mob-connected Jack Ruby murdered Oswald in the middle of police at the police station.  Kind of significant, when looking for mobster involvement.<br /><br />Yes, he mentions Johnny Roselli.  But we all already knew about Roselli's connections with Giancana and the CIA from the HSCA investigation.  However, Files says nothing about the OTHER two mobsters linked to Roselli and Giancana and the CIA's attempt to kill Castro--i.e. Santo Trafficante (Tampa) and Carlos Marcello (New Orleans).  Nor does he say a word about Joseph Civello or Campesi, two top Marcello mafiosi-buddies in Dallas (and both Dallas mobsters were close to Giancana and Marcello. They were angry to have been kicked out of Cuba by Castro, and hated Bobby Kennedy who was fighting organized crime--and deported Marcello who was fuming to find his way back to the U.S. from the Bolivian jungle.  Frank Ragano, Trafficante and Marcello's lawyer, wrote a book about how Trafficante admitted to him that they had conspired to kill JFK).<br /><br />So Files leaves out some very important criminals connected to the CIA (if Giancana's in it, no question about Marcello and Trafficante as well--and Campesi making sure it all went smoothly in Dallas--seems likely, too).  It can't possibly be as he says--just Giancana and the CIA.  And that leads to another problem.<br /><br />Files talks a lot about all his time spent with David Atlee Phillips, whose name often comes up--just like the mafiosi above--as a suspect in the plan to kill JFK in Dallas (Phillips' home town).  But in 1963, Phillips was based in Mexico as the CIA's chief of operations for the Western hemisphere.  Antonio Veciano (founder of the anti-Castro paramilitary connected to the CIA, Alpha 66), said Phillips had been in contact with Oswald, using the alias ""Maurice Bishop"".  Whether that was true or not, who knows?  But the point of an alias (and Phillips has been pretty soundly identified as Bishop now) makes sense for a high ranking CIA official engaged in a highly covert operation.  It defies credulity to think the head of the U.S. spying operations in the entire hemisphere is using his real name and personally spending lots and lots of time chatting up some low-level hood like James Files, whether or not he could be useful to the CIA. If Phillips had actually been involved in a conspiracy against the President, you'd certainly assume he'd have used an alias and covered his tracks, as Veciano and others said. The idea that Phillips had anything at all to do with Files just reads like a fantasy.<br /><br />Far more convincing than all this, are E. Howard Hunt's revelations to his sons before his death.  We know that Hunt--one of the ""former"" CIA agents arrested for the Watergate break-in--was defijnitely of the intelligence agency pedigree that he claimed (unlike Files).  Hunt named names and they made sense (unlike this book)--Frank Sturgis, William Harvey, LBJ, Cord Meyers, and David Sánchez Morales.  Hunt said the man on the grassy knoll was a French assassin (many people have assumed it was Lucien Sarti, the kind of meticulous professional assassin that one could expect to be contracted to carry out a murder of this magnitude.  James Files doesn't seem anywhere near that league.)<br /><br />And, yes, he mentions Nicoletti, but assassination researchers have long speculated about Nicoletti, Giancana's hitman--this isn't anything new.  (One of the most interesting things about Nicoletti is that he was supposed to testify to the HSCA but was ""hit"" himself--three bullets to the back of the head--before he could do it.  Coincidentally, it was the same day George de Mohrenschilt (rumored to be Oswald's CIA ""handler"") received his own notice to appear before the HSCA--and died that afternoon of a shotgun blast to the head.  His death was ruled a suicide.)<br /><br />Of course, it's also well known that Giancana and Roselli were also murdered apparently connected to their HSCA testimonies.  Giancana was in protective police custody at home before his testimony when he was shot multiple times around the mouth and died on his kitchen floor.  Roselli -did- testify, which is why we know about the 3 mobsters working with the CIA to kill Castro.  When the HSCA called him back for more, he couldn't be found.<br /><br />A few weeks later, his body was found dismembered and floating in an oil drum in the Gulf of Mexico.  These connections -- CIA and Mafia and the JFK assassination -- often proved deadly, beginning with Oswald's murder in the police station.<br /><br />The ""lone gunman firing two fatal shots (causing 7 wounds) with his old Carcano rifle from the book depository window"" has already been so thoroughly debunked.  That doesn't mean that everyone who disagrees with it and claims his own involvement has anything factual to offer to the discussion.  (Also, what's wrong with all the people asking Files questions and thanking him for his ""information""?  Even if one assumed he was telling the truth--and I don't--why would you show any respect to a man who is claiming to have murdered an American hero and robbed the country of a great president?  And, also, deprived those who loved him of a great father, husband, friend, son, etc.? (And his daughter Caroline's birthday was 3 days later; son John Jr's birthday was two days after that. Every November 22 for the rest of their lives, they would be reminded of how tragically their father was killed)<br /><br />John Kennedy was a great leader, a great man, who gave his life for his country.  Don't thank some (fill in adjective) who's claiming ""credit"" for shooting him, and obnoxiously answering ""What would you say if you met him in heaven?"" with ""I'd say 'It was nothing personal, just business'.""  And this is his answer -after- Files supposedly ""found God"" in prison (sentenced to 50 years for attempting to kill two police officers in 1991.)<br /><br />I didn't even mention the weird anti-Catholicism of the co-author of this book and her expressed hatred of--of all people--Jesuits.  (Oswald was chosen as the assassin ""because he was a Lutheran"", don't you know.)<br /><br />Not good. Not credible. Not recommended.",1.0,0,2021

She's an amazing writer, she adds comedy and quirky characters, they are always a wild ride and a great read. However, there is something special about Jessie and her team of misfit bad***es.

Austin is like a dream come true, I mean a man that cooks for you? Hell to the Yes! I have been waiting for Elliot to his now and I was not disappointed.

"So cliche in the harem fantasy way.  OP hero, oversexed girls who ""need"" him.  OP villain.....","When I first saw the description of this book I paused.  A super wizard who somehow gets an elf magess, a female werewolf and a female vampire to be his harem?  And the descriptions of the girls made it seem like they'd be the usual oversexed but otherwise poorly developed harem fodder.<br /><br />Well, I hate to say that when I finally decided to risk trying this book I found that my instincts were perfectly aligned with what I found.  The OP is a typical milquetoast loser who through some completely ridiculous coincidence discovers that he has PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER!  And as part of that power he needs training that is coming from 3 women who should be just fine  without him, but who discover that with him they are even more powerful.  But even with all that power, they might LOSE!<br /><br />I know many reviews praised this, but as you can tell with my previous paragraph I wasn't impressed.  There is nothing unique or new here.  The hero is everything I dislike about harem heroes and the women were cliche.  That doesn't include the fact that I dislike the use of vampires as heroes unless its well done, and in this story I can't say I found it to be well done.<br /><br />Lovers of harem fantasy tales will probably really enjoy this story, but sadly, for me it was just another example of everything that makes independently authored stories a bit of a roulette game.  The excellent ones just make it clear how much more a tale like this could be.<br /><br />Its not terrible, but not for me, and unless you truly enjoy harem fantasy tales I think you'll find it to be no different than any other harem tale out there so I dub it a 3 star tale.",3.0,0,2021

I had real hopes for this book,"A woman astronaut, a space expedition in danger, a pink planet - what potential! What a slog! I guess what upsets me the most is that the story would suck me in and then let me down, over and over. Niggling inconsistencies, from a society that trains astronauts from youth but houses them in a Dickensian boot camp, to permitting a multi-year expedition to launch with equipment  people knew was faulty but no one cared because the inventor died. Add to that the nod to Jane Eyre with a one-night stand and LGBTQ lit with a passing mention of what might be a lesbian couple.

Waste of time,"Wanted to like this book. Clearly, the author is intelligent. Early warning signs in the first couple of chapters when far too much of the narrative were claims that ""consilience"" transcends science because of vaguely described limits of scientific endeavor. Well, okay, science may not be able to discover everything that is real, but it wasn't necessary to knock down science to support his ideas. Rather than recognizing science as a set of methods and techniques to winnow truth from empirical data, despite any preconceived ideas we have, he knocks it as merely an abstract social construct that apparently cannot actually touch *his* idea. Of course. And having seen this argument a million times before, it inevitably builds up to huge claims with no evidence to support them, but they're true because 'this is beyond science.' Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. You can't argue your way out of that.",1.0,0,2021
I can't think of how to title this review.  Is that a problem?,"Trying to put into words what I think of RPG Apocalypse is hard.  I didn't hate the tale, and there are no real points I can point to and say, ""That's what I didn't like.""  At least not to the level that justifies a truly scathing review.<br /><br />I did have issues with a few scenes, but none were egregious.  They were just authorial decisions that I did not exactly agree with.  There were characters who I thought could have been used much differently.  Not that they were bad, just disappointing in a vague way.<br /><br />But that probably explains my issues.  There is nothing amazing in this tale.  It is.  There is a main character who I can't really hate, or love because he's so blandly painted.  I can't put myself in his shoes and feel ""wow, I'd love to be him"" and watching over his shoulder I can't even dislike him in a fun way.  He is a passenger in the book just like the reader, and I had no connection to him.<br /><br />The plot was equally bland.  The author went for a lot of tension by having the obstacles usually being too powerful for the main character and his friends, but that mostly meant that the characters don't feel organic and are pushed along by the plot while enjoying their plot armor when its needed.<br /><br />If you like this kind of tale you'll like this, but its nothing special and gets just a 3 star from me.",3.0,0,2021
Details of What Hell is Really Like!,"If you don't have the time to search the Bible for every verse on hell, this book will be very useful for your education. Reading this book is however terrifying when you think that souls can't get out of hell once they are sentenced there.<br /><br />Most of this book is about Christians who were shown hell, but a few unsaved people died and went to hell and then got saved because of their near-death experience.<br /><br />The realities of hell are horrifying. You would not want your worst enemy to go there and experience the torments. This book explains the details of what hell really is like and it is worse than even Jesus spoke of it.<br /><br />This book is a wake-up call to people who think they can get to heaven with unforgiveness in their hearts. In comparison to what you might suffer there it is no problem to forgive and let God deal with the person who has offended you.<br /><br />The message in this book is basically that you are not safe from hell under certain conditions. I think the Christians who ended up in hell were in name only, not practice or belief. I suggest readers of this book also read their Bibles, especially Jesus' words in the New Testament.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",4.0,1,2021

A “Jack Reacher” Novel Authored by Andrew Grant,"Too bad that I didn’t read the reviews before buying this book, BETTER OFF DEAD.  It’s supposed to be the latest Jack Reacher novel, but it’s written by Lee Child’s younger brother Andrew (aka Andrew Grant), who doesn’t really “get” the Jack Reacher character.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  The novel uses the cheapest trick in any writer’s bag to capture the reader and make him/her continue reading. In the opening chapter, he appears to have killed off Jack Reacher.  Then the second chapter begins with Jack’s narrative, beginning “2 days earlier”; and it is not until Chapter 14 that the reader finds out for sure that Jack is only playing dead in the opening scenes.<br /><br />This is far too long to make the reader wait.  And the ruse supposedly carried out by Jack and the doctor/coroner isn’t even believable by the usual “Jack Reacher” novel standards.<br /><br />I absolutely hate novels that hold the reader hostage with this kind of flashback device, and I refuse to waste time reading them through to the end.  It always seems to me that a writer who must resort to beginning a story with an exciting scene from the middle of the story is simply a lazy writer.<br /><br />And another thing:  it’s totally unfair to the readers of any established series (e.g., the “Jack Reacher” series) for the real, best-selling author to quietly farm out the writing of “the next book in the series” to a relative. (This is usually a son or daughter who can use a jump start to his/her writing career.)

This series has been life changing for me. It also pulled me into a book world that I didn’t know existed.<br />The author knew what we needed to hear to gain closure but I will be mourning them for awhile.

Beautiful story - my favorite book of 2021,"ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:  A beautiful story of an imperfect life: love, marriage, home, children and forgiveness.<br /><br />BRIEF REVIEW:  Eleanor had never known love, as the only child of alcoholic parents who were married twenty years when she was born.  Her parents were wrapped up in each other and never seemed to want her around. She was sent off to boarding school and it was while she was at school at the age of sixteen that she learns her parents were killed in a car crash returning from a ski weekend in Vermont.  For Eleanor art, as a form of expression, was a way out her loneliness, her early passion turned into a way to earn a living.<br /><br />With a little money and income from her illustrations and later children's books, she falls in love with a farmhouse with lots of land and even a brook in New Hampshire. She purchased the house complete with furnishings, housewares and tools and so much - it was a house with a history.  She is immediately in love with her home.  A few years later she meets handsome Cam at a craft's fair in Vermont where he was selling his wooden wares, there is instant passion, and before long three children make them a family.  Their Bohemian lifestyle and family makes Eleanor one of the happiest of women in the world.  She even overlooks the fact Cam isn't exactly the most hardworking, helpful or responsible partner but, they have built a life together and the children seem happy and their life is everything she ever wanted.  So when something terrible happens, Eleanor is beside herself and soon life as the family has known it has changed.<br /><br />Count the Ways is a story that spans decades. Eleanor is a wonderful, fully fleshed character that women who have experienced the trials and tribulations of motherhood and marriage will be able to relate to (at least I did.)  I felt her joys, her disappointments, and her sadness. She experiences possibly more than her share of life's disappointments and difficulties but, she finds a way to cope and keep going.  There are a lot of things that happen in this story and yet most everything is still vivid and etched in my mind. I don't want to say too much, I was happy I went into the memorable story without reading what the book was about beforehand. There was so much nostalgia in this story for me as I was raising my children during the same time period: the music, the movies, the news events and more. Everything about this story felt realistic and I don't think it could have been improved upon.  The author covered it all - life, family and all the detours along the way that sometimes make our lives turn out different than we imagined when we were young.  I felt like I was a close friend of Eleanor and of this family when I turned the final page. I didn't want this one to end. The book is sure to make my faves list for 2021. Highly Recommended.",5.0,1,2021
Fun but flawed,"This is not a bad book overall but it has some not so great parts.

The action scenes are good and the side characters are interesting. The writing style flows well and is not overly filled with exposition and dies not get bogged down in trying to explain itself.<br /><br />The not so great. The MC is fun until he is not... every so often the MC gets up on his high horse and becomes preachy about society, economics, religion and their wrongs.

"Would make a beautiful gift for baby showers, birthdays or Kindergarten graduation","""I Wish You Happiness"" is a book full of beautiful illustrations.  There is one sentence per page, each beginning with, ""I wish you"" followed by two words in different colors.  The book and words remind me of greeting card expressions.  Where I can see this book being most useful is for a replacement for greeting cards for things such as baby showers or birthdays.  I could even see this book as being a nice keepsake for parents to give to their children for things such as Kindergarten graduation.<br />There is not a story to this book, so it might not make a good read aloud for young children.  The word choices in the book are way beyond the comprehension of young children.  For example, aspirations, tranquility, and resilience would be very difficult to explain to young children and they probably would not sit still long enough to understand the meanings of the words.  It would be a nice tool for teachers in classrooms for some vocabulary words.  There are also famous people listed in the back of the book to show children different characters that were represented in the book.  There is also a section on the different dogs pictured throughout the book.  So in this way, there is an educational aspect to the book that would be beneficial to teachers as well as homeschoolers.<br />I would recommend this book as a replacement for greeting cards for baby showers, birthdays or for Kindergarten graduation.  Teachers and homeschoolers in early elementary grades may find the book useful as well.",5.0,1,2021
The magic wasn't there,"Ok, I think I mentioned power creep in my review of book 4, if I didn't.  POWER CREEP WAS A HUGE PROBLEM HERE!  (Hopefully that will get to any authors thinking of writing a tale like this one.)<br /><br />Seriously, Allistor gains power faster than most people can gain weight.  Levels flow to him from on high, and yes, he shares with his followers, but it results in some of the worst villain antics I've seen in ages.<br /><br />Yes, Loki and Hel continue their non-sensical plotting.  When I got through this book and thought about the results, I found I had to ask why they plotted at all.  There was no real benefit to them except for feeling they had ""one up"" on the humans and on Odin/Baldur.  But the stakes for them were extremely high, and I just never could figure out why they found it so necessary to play there games.  But, without them this story has no real threat.  Allistor and the people of Invictus are so powerful that no other human force can face them. (something that is made very clear in a few scenes in this book.)<br /><br />There is some tension and a couple of very unnecessary deaths.  (sorry, but while I can accept that the author liked having who he killed die, it did not work for me at all and felt like a case of ""oh, this character is making it hard to move a plot thread forward, so let me eliminate them in a bad way."" - and it was a very unheroic death.<br /><br />Its not a bad tale, and I was interested enough to lay there and read while recovering from CoVid shot #2, but I really felt cheated in so many ways.  The character ""growth"" wasn't there.  The villains seemed to be almost stormtrooper-esque with their wild attacks that might kill secondary characters, but only made Allistor more powerful.  And as I already said, I really, really disliked the fact that Loki and Hel don't have any motive other than the fact that the author wrote them that way.<br /><br />Its worth 3 stars.  Its not really worthy compared to the first 4 books, but its readable.  I'm seriously debating not picking up book 6 should one ever come out.",3.0,0,2021
Pretty silly fast read,The characters were good but the story was superficial without depth. Didn't  care for the secret she was keeping and continued to keep after they hook up. He had a right to keep his secret wheras she did not.  Second problem was the epilogue.  By definition the purpose of the epilogue is to bring closure to the story and/or wrap up loose ends.  It's not supposed to be used for setting up the next story. I find this happening more often than not in series books and wiil knock off a star for it every time.,3.0,0,2021
Misses the Mark,"I loved the first two books in this series and so looked forward to Hattie and Lucien’s story. Unfortunately the Hattie in most of the book is whiny! The spirit of Hattie went poof as soon as she was forced to marry. Lucien’s back story was more interesting, but he uses her to gain entree into polite society, and then takes off with Hattie to Scotland, where the book drags on and on! I guess I just expected more from Dunmore considering her first two books were layered in both plot and character development. This book unfortunately didn’t hit the mark. I know others will love this book, but Hattie can’t make up her mind of what she wants just grated on me. Lucien deserved a better heroine than this flittering idiot. The author just added angst for the heck of it to twist the plot.  But assuming pre sales were high, it is still bound to be a best seller.<br />The audiobook narrator was fabulous, and gave each character a uniqueness all there own.",3.0,0,2021

"A heartwarming, speedy read","I knew that this story was about a rockstar romance, and so I had my expectations set a little lower than for a heavy piece of literature.  The 5-star review reflects the type of book it is.  It's not pretending to be Don Quixote, it's a breezy beach read type of book.  For that genre, it is excellent.<br /><br />It's true that there are a lot of swears in this book, but if you've walked out on a public street for more than five minutes, you've heard it all already.  If you flinch and clutch your pearls every time you hear a curse word, this isn't the book for you.  (But neither is that a reason to give a book a one-star review, IMO.)<br /><br />The story line is great.  Not overly unbelievable (again, considering it's a rockstar romance), and the character development was very good.  My eyes got misty at several points in the book, and the emotion felt genuine, not overly manufactured.  My only complaint is that there are a handful of words that the author apparently loved to use (smirk, for example), that are wayyyy overused in the book.  It was kind of distracting.  I wish she had branched out a little in her descriptions to avoid overuse of the same handful of words.  But the story was great, the characters were compelling, and I was drawn in so much that I finished the book in a day, despite work and everything else.  Nice work, Ms. Cherry!  :)",5.0,1,2021
DNF,"I fell for the nearly 5-star ratings, the writing was awful, nearly impossible to like the main character. She’s supposed to be in her twenties but reads as though she might be in the early stages of high school. I could not for the life of me get absorbed in this book and I’m a horrible sucker for paranormal alpha males and that whole trope. The emotions the author was trying to convey for her characters did not flow for me whatsoever and the amount of exclamation points was absurd, unnecessary, and took more away from the story. The way the main character came to conclusions to important parts in the story was disorganized and really the whole first book read like a fanfiction, I skipped whole chapters of this book and then skipped towards the end just to see how it played it and was also disappointed.

In this brief 6 month separation, of course the heroine hasn’t slept with anyone else. There is no chemistry, and of course the heroes “love” is just not believable. One of the worst books she has every written as far as quality. Completely and utterly pointless. Everything you love about the author is just missing here.

From Pillar to Post to Successful Writer,"This stunning memoir by Ashley C. Ford touched me in many ways. Writing of her earliest years, Ford spoke about the total lack of fairness she experienced at home with her mother. She dealt with a mother with two distinct personalities.  When her mother was nice, she had the personality of "" Mama.""  When she got mad and aggressive, she became ""The Mother,"" who doled out arbitrary and painful punishments. Ashley endured mental and physical abuse from her mother and mother's boyfriends.<br /><br />A part that resonated deeply with me was her experience living with a host of relatives and mother's boyfriends.  Moves to other households were usually precipitated by some disastrous occurrence involving her mother. Ford captured the voice of a preteen or teen who had no say in where she would live or go to school.  Her happiest times occurred when she lived with her grandmother.  Ashley's grandmother was reliable, but hypercritical, frequently schooling Ashley in the lessons of what Other People would think if she acted, dressed or did certain things.  According to her grandmother, what Other People thought was paramount and should drive decisions.<br /><br />Very poignant episodes in  the book dealt with Ashley visiting her father in prison and just making it to the hospital before her grandmother died of cancer. Even as her relationship with her mother grew better over time, life brought unwelcome changes, some of which motivated her to become a successful writer. Ford's triumph over poverty and domestic upheaval is a remarkable story.",5.0,1,2021

Awful,"Who wants to read a three book series where the characters are out screwing other people? And this heroine? Reallly, I think she is probably my least favorite ever. She is selfish and has narcissistic tendencies. She only cares for herself. I hated every bit of success she gained. She did it by breaking the heroes heart in book two. She deserved to be sleeping on the streets not mega successful. I like string alpha men and she mad he look so weak seriously. Plus they both had lined in with other people. Who wants to read about that in book 3?  Just so poorly written. I expected better from this author. I really did. I have heard a lot about how they both needed to grow up... No the author just needed to write them better, like maybe not having them be major douches? I don’t know about everyone else but I would never have picked up the first book if I knew this mess spanned 10 years. Probably the worst trilogy that I have ever read and I won’t be wasting my money on the this author anymore. So sad I used to love her. But this mess ruined me.",1.0,0,2021

Every time I thought it couldn’t get worse it did...,"I’ve been in a book slump lately and have been looking for recommendations online. I have read a few other Brooks by this author with loyal heroes so when someone in a Facebook group told me this was their favorite and I had just “had” to try it, I thought “well why not, everything else hasn’t worked lately.” I don’t understand why people lie to get you to try a book. I really don’t. The person who told me to try this greatly downplayed his betrayal. They explained that the hero/heroine weren’t really married and that the hero had only every been with prostitutes in a blind stupor. NOT TRUE. This “hero” flat says that he never got bombed enough to forget a condiment and it’s not like he found back ally prostitutes and only did it once like he implied to the heroine. No he joined a sex club, was a frequent visitor and had favorites that he specifically requested. He lied to the heroine and said he couldn’t remember faces and names because she always pictures the heroine. But that’s a flat out lie to her. He remembers the ow specifically when one of them shows up claiming he had a child with them. He remembers his favorite positions etc. And again (not that it would have made it better but still) if he pictures the heroine and couldn’t remember the ow, then how/why would he go in and request specific girls?  I was told that the hero makes up for his mistakes and had tried to take care of the heroine and his child. But no that’s not true either. Every time the hero had a chance to do anything right by the heroine he didn’t. Good lord just the amount of money he blew on women and drugs when he could have helped her makes me want to vomit. The heroine is a martyr who never once slept with someone else. She constantly forgives him and he never earns it. When the woman shows up claiming to have his child, she makes her a bed and says she’ll stay with him even if the newborn is his. So how does he make up to the heroine? By demanding anal, in the room next door? Are we serious here? It’s not like the entire plot wasn’t one step too far but how were we ever supposed to forgive this hero when until the last page stuff like this is going on? He says more than once to her and her “boyfriend” that he would not have came back if it wasn’t for her letter asking for a divorce that his friend opened. He said at one point that he didn’t know if he wanted the heroine and the baby. Then at another says that had loved her since the first grade. He says he treated himself like he thought he deserved, like he was neglecting himself. No he was partying it up spending gobs of money on high end sex clubs. He liked it, he enjoyed it. He had favorite women. Literally at one point the heroine refers to him having sex 50 times (which is what I was told and that was bad enough, but I only gave this a try because I was convinced that it was like dirty back ally dealings while out of his mind on drugs) Do not believe anyone that tries to tell you that. THATS NOT WHAT THIS WAS! It was 50 women, not just 50 times (even though he never once tells the heroine the truth about that) that he specifically chose over and over while he makes sure to tell us himself he never got bombed enough to not remember. How does this make any sense? What was the author trying to prove here? If she was trying to make a redeemable male character who has made a few mistakes. She was so wrong here. Over and over again. The heroine always chose him, and at the very end it’s like this author thought we should find him forgivable because he chose her 1 time. And no it wasn’t when it came to the prostitute. He waited it out with her. 1 time, he made the right choice (but truly it should never have been a choice) when he decided not to take a job back where he just came from. This is more of a romance novel for a chauvinistic guy. I am<br />Convinced the good reviews came mostly from bits etc. and it must have been recommended by a pa.

A story with considerable plot and character built into it.  Wonderful tale.,"I picked up this book when it was on a ""try this for free"" offering.  Honestly, I have a bit of a trepidation about dungeon core tales because many end up leaving out the character building I feel is necessary to develop a good story.<br /><br />Shadowcroft Academy for Dungeons (SAD, the rest of this review), is about the characters.  Our Hero Logan is a injured/retired US military veteran who lost a leg to an IED [warning, this is so common in recent tales that I thought it a trope that snuck in, fortunately its quickly made irrelevant].  He is unwillingly drafted into the academy where his background and place of origin makes him by far the weakest new student at the academy in years, if not eons.<br /><br />He ends up with a team of other misfits, who all have ended up at the school for the wrong reasons, and who are looked down on by several of the teachers.  And yet, through realistic development of the relationships and skills they have, and a power leveling system that doesn't make them immediately OP, but rather allows them to eek out several hard fought and emotionally satisfying victories, they take on their freshman year at the academy.<br /><br />SAD is a good book, the editing is strong, the idea is top notch and supported by well thought out characters.  The story builds smoothly with interludes that allow the reader a short emotional rest and recovery before building to the next climatic scene.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't really find anything to complain about.  I'm actually going to do something I almost never do and give this a full 5 stars.  Its probably the best dungeon core story I've read since 2018, and it manages to meld dungeon core with magical academy in a way that is greater than I expected considering the usual offerings in both genres.<br /><br />Worth the read.",5.0,1,2021

This one fell flat for me. Here's why...,"I've been putting off this review because I just wasn't sure what to say. I have adored pretty much every other book Sundin has written and been personally impacted by some of them. Her books have been companions in some hard places in my life.<br />I felt like this one fell flat, and I wasn't sure why until other people started writing reviews. So here is my summary:<br />While the writing, historical research, characterization are still up to Sundin's usual level of brilliance, some of the things that have made her one of my favorite authors just weren't there.<br />Spiritual ~ While both characters come to some conclusions about political and personal change, it is not deeply rooted in the Christian faith as in the other books. It isn't like faith doesn't play a role, but it's just one of many players. They seem to be more impacted by events and politics, than seeing God using events to change them.<br />Romance ~ Sundin usually has more kissing and whatnot than I usually like in books, but it's an aspect I'm willing to tolerate because the books are so, so good. This romance was not that way. There were a lot of awkward moments, a lot of tension that felt forced instead of natural, and things got more steamy than I really felt they needed to be.<br />Healing ~ One of the things that has impacted me the most in the past by Sundin's book is how each of the characters finds emotional and spiritual healing from God often helped by their love interest. Both characters have some insecurity and fears, but they don't push each other toward healing in God, they accommodate each other. Now, I know full well that this can be perfectly healthy and normal. Yet, Evelyn basically is the same person, only without fear of romance and glad she doesn't have to give up anything. Peter changes politically, but other than that also didn't grow a lot.<br /><br />This isn't a bad book, it just fell short for me.",3.0,0,2021
Just Too Short,"Interesting story that is barely similar to Rising of the Shield Hero. About the only thing that is similar is the four hero summoning, betrayal, and acquiring a slave girl. Otherwise it is it's own story. I find I like Lutz. He is willing to stay in that world even after the betrayal and torture since he finds the world so interesting and exciting. He develops into a quiet hero that travels around and tries to be the better person.<br /><br />I like that the other three heroes are doing their own thing and really don't care about the kingdom that summoned them. Since they are from that world itself and not from another world, they seem to have the same mentality of those at the top of the hierarchy.<br /><br />Overall it's a good solid read with an interesting story. I'm curious to see how Lutz turns out and if he will ever encounter the goddess in some way.",5.0,1,2021
"PG-rated version of The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang, with hero as heroine’s sex therapist","Harper and Chase are both 23 and have been best friends for six years, since their freshman year in college. Chase’s family is extremely wealthy, but his entire childhood was made miserable by his hyper-critical father constantly telling him he is not good enough and attempting to control Chase’s entire life. In contrast, Harper’s family is wonderful. Her mother tragically died of cancer when she was only seven, and she was raised in an all-male family. But even though, on the surface, her father and two of her brothers are huge, muscled, alpha-male, ex-pro football players, with Harper they are classic “metrosexual” males. She has never received anything but protective tenderness and compassionate understanding from all of the men in her family.<br /><br />As her best friend, Chase has been adopted by Harper’s menfolk as one of their family and, for years, he has spent a great deal of time hanging out with them, with and without Harper, and has avoided his own family almost entirely. He loves his younger sister and his mother, but he can’t see them, because they are a package deal that includes his awful father.<br /><br />Harper has never dated, other than one utter failure of a date with Chase in the very beginning of knowing each other, that ended with her slugging him for attempting to kiss her. And other than during the first few months of their friendship, after his botched date with Harper, Chase has not dated either. The reason Harper has never dated is that she can’t stand to be touched by anyone but family and very close friends, who include her five best women friends and Chase. But the only touching Chase does, in spite of how much Harper trusts him, is occasionally giving her foot rubs. The sole reason that Chase has not dated for the past six years is that he doesn’t want any other woman but Harper, and even contemplating dating anyone else feels like he is cheating on her.<br /><br />Though Harper has turned a blind eye to it, it is no secret to her family and close friends that Chase has been in love with her for the past six years, and all of them, especially Chase, have been hoping that Harper and Chase would eventually marry. Unfortunately, Harper has firmly convinced herself that anything more than friendship is impossible with Chase, or any other man, because she believes she is irretrievably flawed due to her issue with touching and a tendency to sensory overload in general.<br /><br />Other than the lack of physical affection and sex, the long-standing BFF relationship of Harper and Chase contains every other essential constituent of a committed, romantic relationship. They spend virtually all their free time together, are extremely comfortable with each other, and can talk about anything and everything. Except the most important issue of all: why Harper doesn’t date anyone, including Chase.<br /><br />This story contains one of my favorite features in a contemporary romance—romantic protagonists who realistically earn their gorgeous physiques through exercise and healthy eating habits. Harper is a personal trainer who consumes a very healthy diet, and Chase has gained his gorgeous, ripped physique under the tutelage of personal-trainer Harper and also shares her healthy dietary habits.<br /><br />Similar to the romance novel, The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang, this novel explores the psychological journey of a woman on the autism spectrum with high-functioning Asperger’s as she seeks to achieve an enjoyable expression of her sexuality. In the case of TKQ, the author chooses to offer R-rated sex scenes, with on-stage sex therapy provided by the romantic hero, an expensive courtesan. In this book, given that this author writes G-rated stories, Harper’s sexual awakening only gets to the point of a few kisses on stage. But what both books share in common is the same female romantic fantasy: a male lover who lives to serve the female protagonist, both inside and outside of the bedroom. The heroine has nothing to do in the relationship other than be served and cherished by a slavishly doting hero.<br /><br />I must confess that the trope of hero as sex therapist—which most typically occurs in romance novels where the heroine is a survivor of sexual assault—is not one of my personal favorites. Nor is the trope, in general, of a self-effacing hero exhibiting doglike devotion. I certainly enjoy Beta heroes, but Chase is rather too far out on the extreme end of the Beta continuum for my own personal taste. I tend to prefer romantic relationships that are much more balanced and coequal in the emotional dynamics of sacrificial giving.<br /><br />Having said all that, as an example of the trope of subservient romantic hero, who devotes himself entirely to healing the heroine’s damaged sexual drive, this is an excellent version of that type of story. Judging it on its own merits, and not just my own preferences, I feel comfortable rating the story with 4 stars.<br /><br />Update 11/10/21: In addition to reading the Kindle version of this book when it was first released, I recently had the chance to experience the audiobook version of this novel. It is narrated by two very skilled voice talents, Melie Williams and Kevin Eiger. Both narrators do a great job portraying male and female characters of all ages.

This book offers more practical advice that was easy to understand and I like how the author made an emphasis on feeling good/better and having patience as opposed to looking for a quick fix. It seems more straightforward compared to some of the other books I have read thus far on the subject, though those books are also worth a read and also have good advice for anyone interested in learning about the law of attraction. I do recommend giving this book a read as well.",5.0,1,2021
Great Family Thriller,"I am a great fan of thrillers, action, law etc. This series and author are my first venture into psychological thrillers. i recently read all three books by this author. Fascinating work by an author new to me. This particular book was interesting on so many levels. The complexities of the interpersonal relationships and the different factors that affected each character was extremely creative and a pleasure to read. A friend had suggested I look at these books and I am thrilled to add Claire Amarti to my list of authors that I will follow, along some great authors like Baldacci, Grisham and Patterson. If you are a thriller fan or a fan of strong women characters you will be equally pleased to add her to your list of can't miss authors.",5.0,1,2021
Way too familiar --- same old formula,"I've read the entire series to this point. Unfortunately for me this is the end of the road. Even though our hero is 12 years old he's still the same old character. Along comes the old wizen tribe elder who does his impression of the riddler and gives probably the worst advice he's ever given if you believe out hero is 12. Like why does anyone ever ask Henry anything is beyond belief.  As Dad as he's known in this one -oh please, he's a one dimensional robo doll with a persecutions complex. His angst over the ever nutty tribes feelings for him is boring nonsense. Gee they don't like me cause the don't trust me? What, why? Its tiring. Its all so ""well their Indians so...blah blah blah."" This is probably too harsh since I'm really sad the series is obvously at an end with the author phoning in the thin rehashed plot lines and characters. I would not recommend this one to anyone. The first 16 books, hell yeah they were great. This ""yawn"". Or as Henry would say ""Book is wood, look deeply in the grain to learn the truth, wood and paper are one grasshopper.""  No wait that was Kung Fu. Henry say ""Check out the loose ends 12 year old. You go find out who murdered him"". Has Kent ever met a real live 12 year old?

Every adult in the book failed Sooley and the author failed us all,"I'm a huge Grisham fan, and have read 99% of his books, but I have to say, I disliked this book on so many levels. I gave it only 1 star because I know he can do better, and his writing is still better than most--but--This was so politically correct--so corrosive to what America stands for morally--that I just had to speak up.<br /><br />--Spoiler alert--<br />First, the main character is wonderful and deserves our admiration until--the end. The fact that we don't tell our kids what drugs actually can do to you--maybe because we don't even know--Sooley went blindly into the lion's den with no protection what so ever.<br />His agent let him down by assuming Sooley knew, maybe his friend let him down because maybe he knew how bad drugs in America are, maybe the school let him down because they didn't teach the chemical make up of the drugs kids think are as harmless as aspirin, or maybe his coaches let him down--all I know is that I was disappointed in every adult in this wonderful kid's life.<br />He avoids death in a country that puts the profits of their oil over their citizens, only to end up in a country that puts it's pharmaceuticals and their money over the lives of our kids.<br />I'm disappointed in the music executives who put money over the lives of our kids by promoting the worse kids of music that glorifies drugs and immortality.<br />The adults fail Sooley in every single aspect of his life. And at the end, Murry's mother is complicit in breaking our laws to allow Sooley's family into the country illegally, showing that if you have enough--money(again)--you can basically do anything you want. What is that teaching our children?<br />What is that enforcing in the people who read a famous author like Grisham?

"Writer may have talent, but jumping between multiple focal characters made it impossible to tell.","I can make this review extremely simple.  The author provided a summary that made it seem like the tale would be about a specific character in a starving feudally run mining town and his efforts to survive in the cruel unrelenting world.  That sounded like an interesting idea.<br /><br />But in the first 7 chapters we had no less than 5 different point of view characters.  It jumped around so much that there was no flow to the tale.  Worse in my opinion, the character we were told would be the main character was only in one chapter before the story jumped away from the mining town to go to the academy where ""keepers"" were trained and raised.<br /><br />Well, I didn't sign up to read that tale.  And while it might have jumped back to the mining town, I wasn't going to struggle through the jumping POVs to find out if I ever cared about a character.  Especially as a couple of them were far more villainous and venal than I am willing to read about.

Disappointed,"I’ll admit that I probably hyped up this book so much that my expectations were too high, but this wasn’t the book I was hoping for. I’ve loved Zac since he first showed up in the Guild Codex and couldn’t wait for a book with him as a main character. Honestly, though, it just didn’t feel like him. Maybe he’s still recovering from events from prior books, but he was missing the mystery, swagger, and tall dark and handsome thing here. Instead, he seemed pretty weak the entire story.<br /><br />Saber Rose was a good main, but I struggled to connect with her like I have with this author’s other leading ladies. She acted like she was this dark character that had to fake being nice, but I didn’t see what exactly made her a “bad guy.” Instead she just seemed like someone who wished they were tough but aren’t. I didn’t understand why the side characters were scared of her.<br /><br />The story is still good and I plan to read the next, but I’ll limit my expectations this time around. Hopefully Zac toughens up and Saber loosens up for it. Rikr was my favorite part of the book so I’m looking forward to seeing what happens next with him.",3.0,0,2021
The first two thirds of the book were incredibly depressing.,"I read fiction to enter other worlds, but I have to say I really didn’t enjoy this one that much. The first two thirds is pretty much devoted to the protagonist dealing with a sudden, life changing crisis. It’s a difficult one and I managed to catch on to that right away. The author rather hammers the point home, however, possibly in an attempt to give her character depth. As Merle struggles with her thoughts and feelings, so did I. So much so I almost gave up on wallowing in them with her.<br /><br />The last third of the book is where the mystery really begins. A lot gets squeezed into this part of the story, including endless struggles with the language barrier. As the mystery finally starts to unfold, I found myself having trouble keeping up with the sudden number of characters involved. Many of them are related and, so, have the same last name. I’m still not clear about Merle’s father-in-law’s convoluted marital shenanigans and why, exactly, beyond her need to understand them, they were so important to the mystery. Beyond her initial discovery, they seem to have little to do with French inheritance law and more with her personal curiosity. By this time, I have to admit I had kind of stopped caring about that.<br /><br />I acquired this book through Freebooksy, where you can find free or low cost, limited time offers on Amazon Kindle books (a great way to find a new series or authors you might like, btw), so I may take up the next in the series to see if things improve. Perhaps what appear to be superfluous incidents and facts are the groundwork for a better, second book.",3.0,0,2021

Certainly nothing that provided deep insights into the lives of these players.  The book as also repetitive using the same comment or story in multiple chapters.  It also seemed to be written partially to promote the authors documentary of the same name.  There were very few chapters where I wanted to keep turning the pages to see what happened next.

Finding racism where there isn't any.,"One of the authors Ibram Kendi became news when he accused Judge Amy Barrett of ""cutting their parents out of the picture of humanity"" because she was kind and loving enough to adopt two black children from Haiti.  I doubt he would have said that about her if she was a black woman.  This pattern of finding racism where there isn't any is repeated throughout the book.  The motive behind creating white guilt is to get concessions from whites, to make sure that whites discriminate in favor of blacks when it comes to positions of power, money etc..

Disappointing. Shallow plot. No romance or character growth.,"This book lost sight of the romance. It's so disappointing. There was no character growth, almost everything in the first 50% was a rehash of a friendship we've seen well established in previous books - nothing new there, and worse there is so little romantic intimacy.<br /><br />This book was so shallow. I'm noticing this more and more with Singh's Archangel series and her Changeling series. The couples have lost their spark and instead the plots seem phoned in and the romantic relationships are completely lost in that mess and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Specifically speaking to Illium and Aodhan's book, I wish she had just left them as friends because she wrote them like she couldn't quite wrap her heart around them as a couple, so she kept putting it off in this story until the very final moment. These characters deserved so much better. I love a good M/M romance along with M/F and harem - I love well done romance in almost any sex pairing and trope - but this book can barely be called that it was so lacking in relationship development and passion. I skimmed through over half the book, the revelation of Aodhan's past didn't begin until near the 60% mark and it was severely limited to a brief flashback. I was so disappointed in that because I wanted to know everything, do a deep dive into trauma that has been teased over multiple books as such a defining moment for Aodhan's character, but we barely got more that the Cliffs Notes version. Worse than that, the spark of sexual interest didn't come into play until 80%, which made the idea of a sexual relationship between them seem disingenuous - forced, and even that was barely a flicker. What kind of romance novel waits until the end to even indicate the two main characters find each other sexually attractive?... it was ridiculous and it all culminated into a boring book.<br /><br />Singh can do much better, but over the last few years, she just hasn't. I might be done reading her work at this point.",1.0,0,2021
"White male scientist is the only hope for humanity, and some bad biology","What I loved about the Martian was the “realistic science” involved.  I didn’t fact check the Martian and have no idea how accurate the science is in that book, and I'm not an expert in living on Mars or space travel.  I do know some biology, and Project Hail Mary focuses on a biological organism called Astrophage which presumably has come from another solar system to wreak havoc on Sol (our sun) and deplete the amount of light we receive here on Earth.  Whether an organism traveling back and forth from the Sun to Venus could actually diminish how much light we get on Earth is up for debate and I still have questions … and if it is absorbing vast amounts of energy from the Sun, would that even be reversible?  In the short term, the Sun and sunlight is “renewable energy”, in the long term, it has a finite amount of energy and once that’s used up, it is done.  Nothing lasts forever, not even the Sun.  If it’s not absorbing/diminishing the sun, why is it affecting how much light gets to Earth – it’s not like the position of Venus is in line with the Earth and Sun all the time.<br /><br />This book is (probably unintentionally) hilarious.  Main character, Ryland Grace, is teaching junior high science after kicking himself out of academia by publishing a (clearly non-peer reviewed) diatribe on why extra-terrestrial life can exist without water, disparaging his colleagues in the process. He seems entirely out of his depth when asked to evaluate a potential extra-terrestrial life form.  He describes a lab this way: “All the top-of-the-line equipment was ready for whatever I wanted to do.  I’d never seen a lab so well stocked.”  This clearly shows us Ryland doesn’t have a clue on the depth and breadth of equipment in research labs.  I’ve been in several research labs and there is no way possible that a single lab can contain equipment for “whatever he wants to do”.  Labs often contain highly specific equipment for what that particular lab studies.  For example, a genetics lab that studies circadian clocks in Neurospera is going to have very different types of equipment (including very particular glass tubes) than a lab studying prions which is going to have different equipment than a lab that works on mouse models (most universities have dedicated animal research facilities separate from the lab) which would be different than a lab that does human cell culture (biohazard cabinets, incubators) which would be different than a lab studying zebrafish.  Some basic molecular biology and analysis equipment would be the same (centrifuges, incubators, gel electrophoresis, etc.), most will have a 4 deg fridge, -20 freezer, -80 freezer (or multiples of those), possibly liquid nitrogen storage.  Some labs have very large microscopes (TEM or SEM), or equipment for mass spectrometry.  In order to do “whatever he wants to do” would not just involve equipment but highly specialized reagents and chemicals.  This can be anything from enzymes that cause a specific reaction to occur (for example, PCR needs a polymerase, a primer to bind to the DNA, and all 4 nucleotides, as well as buffers so the reaction occurs under the right conditions).  Some reagents and chemicals in labs are so dangerous or reactive they need to be maintained under lock at all times and regulatory agencies need to be aware of which labs possess which harmful chemicals or biological organisms.  Molecular biology labs that study a specific organism or specific protein are going to have even more specialized reagents, and often “doing whatever you want to do” involves ordering in a lot of reagents from companies who manufacture those reagents at a fast pace: primers to amplify and clone a particular gene, antibodies against a protein or interest, etc.  A chemistry lab would have very different types of equipment than a biology lab (all I remember from organic chemistry lab courses were a lot of different, highly specialized, very expensive glassware for separating different chemicals, a lot by distillation, and having low “purity” scores based off low melting points.  I’m not a chemist).  Presumably a physics lab would have different equipment as well, but I have no clue what goes on in physics labs.<br /><br />What would have been more indicative of Ryland Grace’s enthusiasm for the lab and how much equipment was there would be if he started naming names.  What microscopes?  DNA sequencer? Ultracentrifuge? Mass spectrometer?  He barely uses any of the equipment and since most of it isn’t named, I still have no idea what really was in the lab (and possibly neither does Ryland).  It would be like asking a researcher what their field is or what they study, and they answered “science stuff” instead of the most basic information like ""cancer biology"" or ""cholera"".  That would raise alarm bells for me.<br /><br />And why just one person in the lab?  I know he’s supposed to be the hero of this book, but research publications frequently have many coauthors, some papers have hundreds of authors.  Science is collaborative, the more scientists from different backgrounds you have involved in a project, the more creativity emerges, especially when looking for answers to very difficult questions, like I don’t know, a dangerous single celled organism that might kill off half the human population.  Instead of working as a group for a mutual goal, something humanity is good at and the international scientific community is frequently very good at, we instead get white male mediocrity which is apparently all you really need in this book.<br /><br />The fact that he has to construct his own microscope room in the lab with all possible lab equipment indicates the lab actually isn’t that well stocked, despite what we’ve just been told.  I’ve worked in at least four different labs that each had their own dedicated microscope room, which (surprise!), is basically a little closet with a door so you can do microscopy in the dark.  It’s actually very common if that lab does any fluorescent microscopy (one lab even had two little dark rooms).  That’s something a “well stocked lab” would already have, in my opinion.<br /><br />“Dozens of little black dots each about 10 microns in diameter.”  These 10 micron sized dots are referred to as “tiny single celled organisms”, but they’re huge compared to bacteria (average 0.2-2 microns, mycoplasm infections show up inside mammalian cell culture cells as tiny specks), which is a tiny single celled organism, or even big compared to most yeast (average 3-4 microns).  In a microscope, 10 micrometers is actually pretty big, depending on what objective you use.  For example, the mitotic spindle in human cells is about 10 microns.  A rounded up mitotic cell is about 20 microns.  Mitotic cells are easily seen under a 40x objective in most “basic” biology laboratories, and very good detail can be acquired at 60x (this is 400X or 600X magnification because eye pieces are 10x).  If 10um looks like a tiny dot, you are using a pretty crappy microscope, IMHO.<br /><br />At some point, someone mentions a horse being more efficient than a truck, which is outside my realm of knowledge, but luckily the internet exists and this is something I easily looked up.  Just because one is biological doesn’t necessarily mean it is more efficient.  And it’s not.  Horses need to eat and sleep to live, even when they’re not running or carrying people across land.  Cars (and presumably trucks) are much more efficient burning gas for fuel than horses are at eating a ton of grass and converting that to usable energy.<br /><br />The success of the Martian and its realistic science made me think that Andy Weir bases his books on scientific facts… this book, however, which focuses more on biology than the Martian, makes me think the author (or Ryland Grace) is one of those people that think they know a lot about a lot of different topics and use scientific jargon to convince people they know a lot, when in actuality, they don’t know much and don’t know enough to know what they don’t know.  Many scientists will say things like “I don’t know a lot about this topic”, or “I need to learn more about how X and Y works before I can answer that question”, or “hypothetically speaking, what I think might be going on is…” if asked something they don’t know, while people who have no idea what they are doing dive straight ahead with confidence and claim things that have yet to be proven/are unknown.  This is what Ryland Grace does to the extreme for this whole book, pretending to be an expert in biology, physics, and chemistry (and since he’s the main protagonist, it works well for him).  He talks down to Rocky, an alien, who has less biological expertise (but certainly more materials science) than Ryland.  This is not how science works, and rarely is someone an expert in a very specific field (exozoology) and also an expert in all other scientific fields.  That’s not to say there aren’t some brilliant scientists whose breadth and depth of knowledge is astounding, just that that is rare and they are usually not teaching 8th graders.<br /><br />Ok… back to the Astrophage.  The Astrophage (and other creatures in this universe) all share common traits including mitochondria, DNA, RNA, the Krebs cycle, and ATP, indicating a common ancestor.  In our current understanding of how eukaryotes arose, mitochondria are actually thought to have once been bacteria that lived symbiotically inside an archaeal-derived host cell, and most evidence points to mitochondria arising only once, all eukaryotes share a common ancestor.  Mitochondria DNA is thought to have once been a bacterial genome, and has since first being enveloped by the archaeal host, has shed a lot of unnecessary genes since the eukaryotic host had homologous copies of many of those genes.  Why am I mentioning this?  A common ancestor for humans, Astrophage, Rocky, and Taumoeba must be a eukaryotic precursor, but the Earth is full of bacteria and archaebacteria that have no membrane bound organelles, and don’t have mitochondria.  You don’t actually need mitochondria for the Krebs cycle, bacteria do it all the time in their cytoplasm.  So in this book, presumably archaea, eubacteria, and eukaryotes would have had to all came to Earth independently (bacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes all presumably have the same ancestor since all use the same DNA, RNA, and genetic code for determining amino acids and many proteins across all three domains, and yet eukaryotes exist in far off places like Tau Ceti or Erid), because if all eukaryotic species in the galaxy (or universe) are related, they all must arise from a common ancestor, which diverged from Archaea and Eubacteria before coming to Earth (in this book).  I have no way of knowing what happened, I’m just surprised that all the alien life forms mentioned are eukaryotes.  Have viruses not arisen in any of these extraterrestrials?  Not everything alive has mitochondria.  (I’m not sure the author knows this though.)<br /><br />Avoiding spoilers, I’m just going to say that a biological organism passing through a material that is impervious to even small gas molecules seems extremely unlikely, and suggests the author has no idea how molecules interact with each other atomic level or what a van der Waals radius is.  We are challenged to believe that something that contains DNA, RNA, and ATP can pass through a substance that single gas molecules which are much smaller than any of those molecules cannot.  I can’t get my head around how that would be physically possible.<br /><br />Why doesn’t Ryland Grace care about anyone on Earth?  He claims he doesn’t have friends, he doesn’t have a love interest, but does he have family?  A mother, a father, siblings, nieces and nephews?  He claims he cares about his students, but ultimately does not seem to care all that much.  Is he a sociopath?  Not once does he have a thought like: “Oh, I guess I’ll never see Dad again.” or “It’s so sad both my parents died when I was young”.  There’s nothing about his family at all.  I know this makes it easier for the author to have him act in an altruistic manner to attempt to save all humanity without him constantly thinking “I need to save my 2 year old nephew, he means the world to me”, but… it seems lacking in humanity there.  If at the end of the book, we were told, “Surprise! Ryland was a robot the whole time”, I would have laughed but then thought that makes total sense.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed parts of this book.  I wasn’t expecting the science parts to be really bad, but that’s what got me annoyed with this book early on.  I have no idea how accurate any of the physics is including space travel at 1.5xg or the centrifugal design of the ship to simulate gravity, but I can speculate that that part too is riddled with errors and inaccuracies (once the illusion that this is in any way based of science has been stripped away, the whole premise starts to fall apart for me).  A lot of this book though, reminded me of someone who thinks they know a lot about science and are trying to use terms to sound smart and knowledgeable, when in fact, they don’t know a lot and are making it up as they go along.  It is always best to acknowledge when you are out of your depth/do not know something.  Scientific papers have a discussion section where authors frequently acknowledge drawbacks or alternate explanations for findings, how their findings conflict with previous publications, and things that still need to be discovered.  I find it really strange that Ryland Grace is seemingly an expert on all sorts of fields (physics, chemistry, biology) and just plows ahead to the right solution every single time.  Did he have a biology lab when he was an exozooologist (because before Astrophage there were zero alien life forms for him to study)?  I’m assuming that was more philosophical than wet lab based, but then, when did he learn all his lab skills?  As for the characters, I assume we’re supposed to like Ryland since he is often the only character, but I found him uninteresting as a person and a bit too egotistical and self-centered about his own knowledge.  He has all the published works of mankind at his fingertips, but I can't remember him looking up answers or how to go about solving anything.  Rocky was an enjoyable and interesting character.<br /><br />Finally – the entire idea that the future of humanity depends on one research mission light years away and that everyone is going to sit around eagerly awaiting results for 25 years is just not believeable.  Astrophage is a biological organism, with DNA, RNA, mitochondria, and ATP and the Krebs cycle (it’s repeated many, many times throughout this book).  There are thousands of scientists who are experts on how cells work and we’re supposed to believe that the whole world just puts their hopes on not starving to death on one space mission and wait around for 25 years?!?  A difficult problem can be addressed in different mechanisms, and there can be multiple correct solutions to solve a problem.  Sure, finding out what’s happening in the one solar system that doesn’t have diminished light might solve the problem, but so can engineering a virus that kills off astrophage, so can altering the makeup of Venus’s atmosphere so it no longer contain CO2.  Ryland Grace even proves this point for us when he figures out how Taumoeba become nitrogen tolerant, it wasn’t just one mechanisms.  I’m just tired of the white male savior trope in science fiction books, and especially this trope of this one guy saving all of humanity.  Research and efforts of thousands of people went into coming up with a vaccine for Covid quickly, and of understanding how cells work and the basic biological principles of how proteins are made (DNA - mRNA - protein), and how the immune system works.<br /><br />I was not surprised in the least to find out that Andy Weir consulted someone on astronomy, stellar sciences, planetary and atmospheric science, exoplanet detection, neutrinos, and chemistry, but apparently no one is basic biology who could tell him not all single celled organisms have  mitochondria.",2.0,0,2021
I'm baffled by so many 4 & 5 star reviews (and I was duped!) :(,"I had such high hopes for this read! But, although there was potential for a riveting story, this one was so implausible as to make me cringe.<br /><br />The circumstances, the events, the characters and the atmosphere were all one-dimensional and, sometimes, nonsensical. The story was supposed to alternate between 18th century London and present day. But, save for the chapter headings, the past London could have been present, given the vagueness of the descriptions. The dialogue was anachronistic to the point of being ridiculous. And the relationships were totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The premise of the plot held so much promise! Too bad it was wasted by poor writing.",2.0,0,2021

Good beginning and end; tedious middle,"I did a lot of underlining in the first chapter; the author's comments about our culture's discomfort with pain and struggle resonated strongly with me. However, the further on, the more tedious the reading grew. Pages and pages about  things related to winter from history and the life of animals - which were very well written, but (I felt) didn't make a significant larger point, or move the story forward. They felt more like the author intellecualizing the topic so as to keep it at arm's length.<br /><br />(To be fair, I have already been on a self-care journey for several years. Maybe if this were all new to me, it might have been more meaningful.)<br /><br />Part way through the section called January, I couldn't take it any more, but I thought _maybe she reaches a helpful conclusion at the end_  so I skipped ahead to the last chapter. Finally, in the epilogue, I found some useful words again.<br /><br />I may quote from those two chapters of this book, but I probably won't recommend it to friends.",3.0,0,2021
Well written but depressing,"This is a well written chronicle set in the 1950s about Mathilde, a woman from Alsace, France,  who marries Amine a Moroccan soldier. She moves to his country with idolized visions of what her life will be like but all too soon discovers just how far removed reality actually is. The dusty hot weather, scant existence, racism and cruelty she experiences at the hands of her husband, his family and others left me with a feeling of sadness and despondency. The story was best summed up with this paragraph<br />""After quietly closing the door and walking into the hallway, Amine thought about how the fruit of the lemange tree was inedible. Its pulp was dry and its taste so bitter that it brought tears to his eyes. And the world of men is just like the world of botany, he thought. In the end one species dominates another. One day the orange will win out over the lemon, or vice versa, or the tree will once again produce fruit that people can eat. 4 Stars.",4.0,1,2021
A Life’s Work For Only $0.99,"“Once upon a midnight dreary” I was having trouble sleeping and was doing some reading on my iPad on the living room couch. A whim struck me to read some Edgar Allen Poe-try, and rather than disturb my wife getting one of my thickest books off my bedroom nightstand I thought I’d take a look and see what was available on Kindle. I was both pleased and saddened to find the Complete Tales & Poems instantly available for the lowly sum of only $0.99. Seconds later I was enjoying my favorite, Annabel Lee, without having had to move more than a finger. This is a great collection that includes some very informative footnotes and a very good, readably short biography at the end. Don’t let the low price fool you into devaluing either Poe’s works or this Kindle book. This is probably the best value I’ve found in the past year — and I now have a bit more space on my nightstand, too.",5.0,1,2021

sorry I kept reading,"on the good side: liked the dragon culture, the Korean magical races and beings and the Philomena’s backstory.<br />on the bad: excessive use of ‘awesome’, Philomena is a total Mary Sue and the characters spend more time talking about where to get food than planning to defeat the bad guys.<br /><br />Too much of the book was used to describe getting coffee, takeout or going out to eat, gaming, discussing hospitality issues and various characters going back and forth between South Korea and the Pacific Northwest. Oh, and also on boring interactions between characters (they were probs meant either to be funny or to balance out the magic parts, but just didn’t work for me.) The world-building wasn’t, there were almost no meaningful conversations, there was little struggle or hardship involved in solving their allegedly dire problems, and all in all too much of the text just didn’t matter. A better editor would trim out all the ballast, add tension and try to make everything more real . . .<br /><br />. . . Including the characters, who were perfunctory. Philomena’s in-laws, the Muirs, were cardboard bullies; the rest were one-dimensional placeholders. There was no effort spent making anyone complex or interesting—even Philomena was barely sketched in. It felt almost like the author was creating hashtags instead of people. Kwan’s father Hwang, for instance, might just as well be introduced with #grumpydad #patriarchalbully.<br /><br />Between Philomena doing supposedly impossible things with just a wave of her hand and all the time spent reading about coffee and meals, this was a very unsatisfying book for me. You’ll have to decide if you want to spend your time and book budget on it, or pick something that sounds more entertaining (as I really wish I had done).",2.0,0,2021

Not at all what I expected,"This book was actually kind of lame. It started out describing the big muscly tattooed ex military special ops wolf<br />shifter bikers calling their penis' ding dongs? I thought maybe I'd bought a book written by a 6 year old. Fortunately they used adult language in most of the rest of the book. The first 75 pages or so are this couple having oral sex. Come on man, I like it as much as the next person, but on and on, it gets pretty boring.  At about page 100 I tried to find out how to return this and get my $5 back. I wasn't able to get a refund so I thought I would try to finish the book. After they stopped licking each other and came up for air the book finally got into a little bit of an interesting story line. Deke even started talking in complete sentences. (eye roll) It was really difficult though to warm up to the characters, especially Sadie. They tried to make her look like an innocent kindergarten teacher by her throwing her hand up to her mouth whenever she was surprised or embarrassed and using the word fudge. Who does that? An eighty year old? But it's hard to be a little church mouse and give a BJ like a porn star (Dekes words).  Finally when the other men in the pack realized they could have women too, it got interesting, but that was at the end of the book. This was a missed opportunity for a really good book.  I have no desire to continue with this over priced series.",3.0,0,2021
Cute and clean,"Cute and sweet, clean romance. This is a short book so everything moves quickly and while it wasn't exactly insta-love, it doesn't take long. I think what I enjoyed most about the book was every time Georgia spoke her mind to Crispin (which was a completely inappropriate way to speak to an earl), he found it amusing. She didn't act or speak like the husband hunting ton and he enjoyed it. His turn around in how he treats his son was quick but like I said, the book is short so there isn't a lot of time to develop everything. I also liked that even though Georgia is essentially the mother to her siblings and she knows she needs to provide for them, she is mature but could still giggle with her friend like a teenager and enjoy some youth.<br /><br />It is a quick read so perfect for an afternoon or evening by the fire.<br /><br />No sex, language or violence",4.0,1,2021

Never did any work growing up, just packed off to camp every summer where he spent most of his time staying in trouble where he was self-centered and his ego was that the world evolved around himself.  How he got hired by FOX with his work record is amazing, but he has made the most of the opportunity, although he stumbled a lot around his successes.  Jesse seems to have worked out his shortcomings and has been very lucky as he matured.  He still seems to be a boy at heart, but must be congratulated as he has pulled it all together rather successfully.",3.0,0,2021
Well written summary of the Western Front.,"This book would make a good summary of the western front in WW1 for anyone, such as myself, who have read histories of segments of of that Great War.  I would have given the book 5 stars if I thought it had lived up to the advertising hype around its publication.<br /><br />The book was supposed to show how the allies and associated powers and the central powers, specifically Germany, adjusted to each other in technology and military thinking over the course of the war.

Wimpy heroine and nasty hero,"I picked up this book and thought, Great! K.A. Is back to her usual!<br /><br />Uh, no. This book is very problematic.  A few of the issues include domestic violence btwn them (forgiven, of course) and a variety of extremely crappy situations/things said to the main female character. Now add to that the main male character refusing to call the cops when his daughter is almost raped bc he doesn’t like them.....his solution? Beat them up but otherwise leave them out in the world to do harm to other women. Now add to THAT a main character who is wimpy beyond belief and is WILLING to accept regular infidelity and a man who will regularly turn her valid complaints around on her.<br /><br />This is almost a carbon copy of other MC stuff  from K.A. - lady in distress, bikers help and also want to lead lives on the straight and narrow, step-children and mean exes, etc. It could be Motorcycle Man but with crappier characters that make it hard to root for them.",1.0,0,2021

I don't like descriptive books and at about 80%, this gets really descriptive.  If that doesn't bother you and you like a romance and story about overcoming odds, I think you will love this book.<br /><br />Content: Rape, alcoholism, abusive parents, and some descriptive sex scenes<br />Language: Lots of f-bombs<br />Religious:  This book has both sides of religion-extreme control and the good of faith and regular prayer.

"Perseverance is important, but there are other things we need to teach our children.","The first thing I have to say is that the illustrations in this book are VERY well done! No child will be disappointed with them. (Or adult for that matter.)<br /><br />As for the story: I enjoyed it, and the rhyme had a steadier rhythm than many I've read through the years. It was also a great lesson in perseverance - something we all need. It is true MOST of the time that we get better at something the more we practice. However, there is another side to the coin that we also have to acknowledge at some point in time or we will do our children a great disservice. In fact this story overlooks a couple of important points.<br /><br />There are some things we will not master no matter how much we practice. I don't care if you make your child practice singing 12 hours a day. If he can't carry a tune in a bucket, (and trust me - a LOT of people can't), he is never going to be a world famous baritone in the biggest opera house on the planet. If he cannot sing, he is only going to be frustrated and depressed AND think you are very disappointed in him. A parent needs to encourage children to excel, but it is also our responsibility to help them understand their limitations and help them discover what their talents and strengths truly are.<br /><br />The other problem with this story is that it gives the idea that winning is everything. It isn't. We need to understand that sometimes we will win, and sometimes we will lose; but we need to learn how to lose gracefully. If we stomp our feet and take back our basketball or knock the game off the table (or make a mess of whatever we're doing), no one is going to want to play with us after a while.<br /><br />This is a lesson a child HAS to learn or he will not have any friends! I know this firsthand. My granddaughter's problem was that no matter what you played with her, she had to tell you everything to do. We use to play Shopkins. She would tell me which character I would be. Then when we played, I would make up something to do with my character like buy a purple hat. Oh, no! I had to buy the green purse! When I said I didn't want a green purse, she had no qualms about telling me I WAS going to get the green purse. She even told me exactly what I could SAY! Well, I am the grandmother, but after a while I flat out refused to play with her.<br /><br />This adorable, cuddly little girl would come home from school time after time absolutely miserable because no one would play with her. I said I didn't blame them: I wouldn't even play with her, and I loved her to infinity and beyond! It took a long time and a lot of work for BOTH of us, but she finally figured out how to play nicely - even if things didn't always go her way. Even when she lost if we played a board game. (In fact, when I won she actually began telling me, ""Good job!"" )<br /><br />Yes, we NEED to encourage children to persevere because sometimes practice does make (near) perfect. However, there is a time and place for honestly explaining that perhaps golf isn't their talent: had they considered hockey? You've seen them on ice skates, and they're pretty good at it. You also know how well they are at hitting the net in soccer. You just might help them find what they were born to do even if it isn't necessarily the first thing that interested them.<br /><br />And don't forget to teach them sportsmanship. Winning honestly isn't everything. Anyone who thinks it is will more than likely have a miserable life. They won't always win the game, get the blue ribbon, or get the promotion that really should have been theirs since they had trained the underling who did get the promotion. Who knows? Maybe the underling had a better attitude and didn't think the world owed him the best of everything. Maybe the underling found out that what the boss really wanted was someone who worked well with others, knew how to delegate, met deadlines, and wasn't just some yuppy ""yes man"".<br /><br />So teach your kids to work hard for what they want but to know they won't always win; and when they don't, they'd better be a good sport about it. Otherwise your unhappy children will grow up to be miserable adults, and you will be part of the reason. It is MUCH better to be part of the solution!",4.0,1,2021

It’s so beyond obvious that she wants to rationalize a mans cheating so that she can feel better about herself. All I thought this entire book, is “honey, no! He just didn’t love you.

I had no hesitation in choosing to read this one first as I recalled what an outstanding writer David Estes is and I was not disappointed. He has the ability to flesh out his characters so that you understand the motivation behind the things they do. Not all of them are likable yet I still find them fascinating as they struggle with hard choices.

Bad ending,"This is one of those books that could have been great if the author didn’t just pretend that the emotions most women experience just aren’t real or that having them would make you less of a woman. I don’t know if it was a “trying to hard to be PC or woke” thing or what, but she really screwed up the story. I have seen other authors do do as well, abd I wish they’d stop. Women don’t have to put the needs of all the women that their spouse has slept with first. They don’t have to be friends with them, to be strong women. If a friendship is organic, great. I wouldn’t have a problem being friendly with my spouses ex. But in this kind of scenario? I’m, no... Just no! in a book where the “hero” literally lives with a harem, it’s creepy and weird to still have the harem live with them afterwards. It doesn’t make the heroine just an amazing person. It makes her look dumb and weak, and also makes the hero look as if he has had no growth. I knew I was taking a risk reading about a hero with a harem, but was assured that it was handled well. I was lied to or the person just has no self respect. I wish I’d have listened to my gut. I wasted time and money.",1.0,0,2021

"Adorable, G-rated, New Adult, romantic comedy, set in a quaint village in England","Daisy Monroe is 26, and for the past six years, she has been in a romantic relationship with a wealthy control-freak named Phil, who is approximately a decade older than her. He calls her by the demeaning pet name, “Goose,” which she has always hated, but somehow she has never quite mustered up the gumption to insist that he stop using it. For the past two years she has lived with Phil in his fancy apartment in a prestigious part of London and has convinced herself he is “wonderful” because he is successful, handsome, and has “a rugby player’s build in a Gucci suit.”<br /><br />Though Daisy was an indifferent student in a formal education setting, in the years since she left school, she has relentlessly studied on her own, in particular, teaching herself computer programming and digital marketing. While working as a temporary employee, she landed an assignment a year ago with a prominent London business where she has gradually become their de facto digital marketing and web person. She has done such a terrific job, in truth, that she has had valid reason to believe she would be given a formal offer of a permanent position doing that same work. Unfortunately, she is dumped from her temp job when the position she sought is handed to a far less qualified man.<br /><br />Daisy stumbles home much earlier than normal in abject despair, only to come upon Phil at their shared apartment, locked in a blatantly sexual embrace with another woman! Daisy backs away in horror, with only one thought in her mind, to get away from her cheating bum of a boyfriend. Phil’s unapologetic, patronizing gaslighting, declaring she should come back into their apartment immediately because she didn’t see what she actually saw, does not stop her from skittering away from him. In a complete daze, Daisy ponders what her choices are and realizes she has no friends, because domineering Phil has, over their years together, systematically isolated her from everyone but him and her mother, who is Phil’s biggest fan. Daisy’s retrograde mother has been constantly urging Daisy to hold onto Phil by employing 1950’s style, submissive, womanly wiles, because she considers Phil a tremendous catch, whom she can’t imagine how Daisy ever managed to latch onto. When Daisy calls her mother to tell her what happened with Phil, hoping for moral support, completely in character, her mother urges her to overlook Phil’s cheating, stating that it’s just the way things are with men of his social standing. Fortunately, Daisy ignores this awful advice and instead wanders in a daze to the nearby London train station. There, she randomly hops on a train, exhausts herself weeping, and falls asleep, until the conductor wakes her and tells her she has to get off. It’s the end of the line. Daisy has arrived in a little village she never heard of before called Upper Finlay.<br /><br />Thus begins Daisy’s adventures involving a handsome bookstore owner, Alex Dean, who is her same age, his lovable Great Dane, and Alex’s colorful coterie of loyal and welcoming friends.<br /><br />I enjoyed everything about this terrific, G-rated, contemporary romance. Unlike a great many British romances I have read previously, which are actually chick lit, in spite of being marketed as romance, this novel truly is a romance. Yes, it is written in first person point of view (POV), which has never been the expected manner of writing novels in the romance genre. They are written in the third person POV of both the heroine and the hero. It is chick lit that is written in first person POV. But unlike chick lit, which is typically about a twenty-something woman’s dating disasters in a city setting and stresses female rejection of romance in favor of BFF relationships with a loyal band of hard-drinking women, this novel is set in a village and stresses Daisy’s growth from a pliant doormat with insufferable Phil, to an independent, self-confident woman and an adorable, “friends to romance” connection with marvelous Alex.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed that though there is plenty of vibrant, exciting chemistry between Daisy and Alex, unlike virtually every other G-rated, adult romance I have read, this author has an extremely well motivated reason for why there are no sex scenes between two consenting adults at all in this book.<br /><br />The setting is also a big plus in this novel. It is very well drawn such that I got such a strong sense of place, I felt like I was right there with Daisy in the delightfully quaint village of Upper Finlay.<br /><br />All in all, from start to finish, this is an extremely well plotted dramedy, and I enjoyed every part of the book.<br /><br />I rate this romance novel as follows:<br /><br />Heroine: 5 stars<br />Hero: 5 stars<br />Subcharacters: 5 stars<br />Romance Plot: 5 stars<br />Daisy Coming into Her Own: 5 stars<br />Setting: 5 stars<br />Writing: 5 stars<br />Overall: 5 stars",5.0,1,2021
"Stolen Idea, wrong conclusion, presented as fact","The most important idea coming out of this book is that there was a groundbreaking study on the Hazda which factually came up with one scientific fact, hunter gatherers that walk around 8 hours a day have, more or less, the same daily energy needs as an office worker in New York. Gundry comes up with a reason for this (the office worker in New York has more inflammation)... but I stress, it is an untested and unproven reason... nor does it make sense with the actual study.  You see the actual study also noted that it is the same for animals. A wild Lion burns as much as a Lion in captivity. Are the captive animals also suffering from too much inflammation? Maybe but seems unlikely.<br /><br />These theories are the life's work of an evolutionary biologist Herman Ponzer. Ponzer actually studied with the Hazda and his theories on these issues are formulated with an evolutionary biologist's perspective. While Ponzer agrees, in part, that inflammation may play a role.. it is Ponzer's theory that energy expenditure is constrained and tightly controlled.  And in his book ""Burn"" he goes through the many reasons that makes sense from evolutionary biology's perspective, ie, energy is the currency of the wild... the more you have the more successful the species will be... thus the tight control of it.  If the Hazda start exceeding their usual TDEE, the body reacts by shutting down optional systems and increasing hunger.  Conversely, the office worker who is getting far more energy that he needs daily - the body adapts by converting the excess to fat -- and wait for it... the body is forced into ""negative energy burners"" to dispose of the excess energy. He suggests to burn off excess energy the body does things that are not good for you, like increase inflammation, increase cell proliferation (cancer), for example.. skin tags, moles, fibroids, ovarian cysts... etc to burn off the excess energy that comes in daily.<br /><br />So you can see how Gundry's explanation is nothing more than a pale and misguided rip off. The remainder of the book goes into some of the worst snake oil I have ever seen. Actually devoting time to an internet rumor that has been completely debunked, ie... that if you chill your carbs after you cook them they will turn into resistant starch. I too fell for that one but it has been completely debunked. Just google it.  He then goes into the pre/ pro biotic snake oil which in 10 or so years has only impacted health in so far as it has stolen money from people's wallets for ""pro biotics"".<br /><br />Eventually Gundry talks about fasting and this is where he will get you to believe he is right. Fasting itself is going to give you more energy. First, it will reduce the daily energy needed for digestion.  Secondly, depending on how long you do it, it can stress your body and release adreneline and cortisol.  Fasting is likely to put you into ketosis and ketone bodies give you energy and water fasting, will give you water and lessen dehydration -- which makes you sleepy.<br /><br />Why is everyone exhausted all the time? It is as simple as can be... we are eating too much. Everyone knows that eating a big thanksgiving day dinner will exhaust you. We now have that up to 6 times a day.  It is my theory that your body makes you sleepy after eating because is wants you to stop using energy so it can use it to digest the food. If you want your energy back just try fasting.",1.0,0,2021

Solid and mostly makes up for the ending in book 5,"I know from reading Daniel's blog that he was a bit surprised by how much vitriol came out over the ending to book 5 in this series.  I was one of those who condemned the incomplete and cliffhanger ending of that book.<br /><br />He tried to make up for it a bit here, and the first chapter is a bit of a recap as well as a way of covering the last few moments of the fight in a way to also move the plot forward.  Its as close to an authorial apology as anyone can expect.  Although he later references the ending to his second book in another series and comments about that cliffhanger ending, promising that book 3 will fix that one.  Honestly, Daniel appears to have a growing problem with this kind of ending where he openly leaves plot threads dangling.  And he doesn't need to do this.  The stories he writes are strong enough to not require that gimmick in order to interest readers.<br /><br />Once we get past the recovery, we have a solid story as our hero works hard to keep moving the various crafts he's been working on forward, while trying to increase the ability of his family to protect themselves.  He's somewhat thwarted by the continuing antics of the cities ignobility who are happy to corrupt guards, engage in open assassinations, and in general openly mock all civilized behavior.  Its entertaining and can generate strong emotions, but at the same time I think that the storyline needs to run its course after this book.  Another book of Sean running around the city trying to complete tasks while the nobles use corrupt guards to stop him will end up feeling very anti-climactic.  He needs to move the story forward somehow.  This book did close off a couple plot threads, but also did so in a way to simply move some of the plot to a new villain with less clear motives.  It works to a point, but felt like an attempt to avoid the problem.<br /><br />I still think this is Daniel's second best series, with only the Aether's Rebirth series being stronger.  He definitely made up for the abortion of an ending in book 5, and he's clearly trying to keep the emotion going.  I'd recommend starting with book 1 so you know who everyone is, but this story is worth the read.",4.0,1,2021
Very interesting read,"I had no knowledge of this historical event and reading it during a huge winter snow fall in Texas with the suffering it brought, even in modern times, was especially touching. I don’t think the writing was especially distinguished; however, I liked that the sisters, Raina and Gerda, did not end up as I thought they would. The author touched on differences between city and country life, between life on the prairie for men and women, and especially about the choices one makes in life: selfish or charitable, and how one choice forever changes life. Mrs Peterson, and her husband, too, surprised me, as did Annette and Tor. Each dealing with life forever changed by the Children’s Blizzard.",4.0,1,2021
Neutral 3 stars,"Like some other reviewers, I had some issues with this series. On the one hand it was very imaginative, the characters were likable, and the plot was interesting, but on the other hand, it dragged on and on and became very dull due to lack of plot progression and tedious bedroom scenes that went on way too long.<br /><br />To be clear, I am a huge fan of smutty books, but after 3 books filled with vivid descriptions, even I was skimming through the details of each sex scene. In addition to that, there were parts of each book where EVERYTHING happened, then longer periods where not much did. The pacing was way off and this series could have comfortably wrapped up in 3 books.<br /><br />What I liked most were the characters, all of which amused me and irritated me at different points. I enjoyed Rans, Guthrie, Nigellus, Len, Edward, and so on. Zorah was an everyday gal who fell into some extraordinary circumstances and I think her view on things would be pretty normal for someone in that situation. She does some really stupid stuff, but it makes sense that she would in the context of the story so it worked for me.<br /><br />I thought the plot was unique and interesting and even though things should have moved way faster, I did want to find out what happened next. Without that intrigue, I probably would have DNFd this series due to boredom (and almost did several times).<br /><br />I will not read Guthrie and Vonnie's books because I'm afraid it would take me forever to get through them like this series. I do love Guthrie, but I can't do it, man. I'm glad I finished this series but I would only recommend it with serious reservations. Be prepared for a long reading slog if you do start it.",3.0,0,2021
Huge let down after Evelyn,"Wow, this book was a big letdown. I adored Evelyn Hugo and really liked Daisy Jones, but this one fell so flat. The characters were so boring, and there were too many tropes and cliches.

There was no true love or dedication or redemption or sacrifice. It was just boring.",2.0,0,2021
Very interesting worldbuilding and flow,"This was an interesting read, with a bit of Glen Cook's 'The Black Company' feel to it, where the protagonist is the person who also keeps the Company's history - the Company (if I recall correctly) is broken up into Dog (heavy infantry), Reapers (shock troops, light infantry), Voodoo (Psyops and dirty tricks, comprised of such characters as Stinkeye, Cook, Nether, and Little Girl) and the HQ group.  The world is a mix of genres, ranging from some Warhammer 40,000 feeling elements to Monarchs, who feel like a cross between the ancient Greek concept of gods on their high mountain and Methuselah's from Altered Carbon.  The story itself follows Reaper Platoon Sgt. Orion through a contract on a planet called Crash/Astralon (forgive me if I misspelled Astralon), and the Company is fighting on the side of the locals who want their planet's independence from the Monarchs.  Over the time period of the book, the first half is moments in the early fighting, with a lot of flashbacks and exposition to expose the reader to this literary universe, while Orion and the Reapers go through what feels like 'same thing, different planet' to them, but as the story progresses towards the mid-point, the asides and worldbuilding fall away as the fighting gets more intense, and the stakes advance from 'get paid' to 'survive to leave this planet.'<br />*Minor Spoilers ahead, stop reading here if that bothers you.*<br /><br />Memorable moments: fighting through a starport under the influence of something along the lines of LSD, to counteract the effects of a more lethal hallucinogen that Cook flooded the area with, including a scene similar to The Shining in a bar - Little Girl (literally a little girl, but she has a connection to another dimension) saying 'he is coming,' and something I can best describe as the 'Doom Soldier' from the Doom Eternal warps in from another dimension to lay waste to anything around him.  The Planet of the Apes on Steroids attackers at the crash site, and other bits through the book, such as the progression from 'new kid' to getting a Name in the company.",5.0,1,2021
"Fond of this series, but this one isn't as good as earlier books in the series","It’s almost Easter, and Hannah Swensen is busy getting ready to fulfill the many orders that have been received at her Lake Eden, Minnesota bakery. Hannah loves her business but nothing is more important to her than her close friends and family. Therefore, Hannah drops everything when her sister Andrea calls her in a panic. Andrea has returned to Mayor Bascomb’s office to apologize after a heated argument, but finds his dead body. Andrea becomes one of the top suspects in the case, so it’s up to Hannah to find out who really killed the cantankerous politician and prevent her sister from going to jail for a crime she didn’t commit.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book. I have such affection for this series. I like the setting and most of the main characters. The plot of this book is very interesting and when Hannah is questioning witnesses and potential suspects in the murder, I really enjoyed it. I also like that there are some scenes of Hannah working at The Cookie Jar instead of just saying she owns a bakery/coffee shop to add to the atmosphere of the book. However, there isn’t a lot of substance to the book. There are so many scenes of Hannah talking about recipes she’s going to try and then the recipes themselves, that there isn’t a lot of the book dedicated to the actual plot. There is so much filler in the book and the dialogue in this book is so stilted and unnatural especially between Hannah and her mom, sisters, and long-time friends and it takes away from the story. It’s better when she’s gathering evidence or talking about the case.  Another unfortunate device used in this book is Hannah’s internal dialogue between the rational and the suspicious parts of her mind. If this were done a couple of times to show that Hannah is starting to recognize what a great guy Norman is but is finding it hard to trust herself after the debacle with Ross. However, this happens over and over throughout the book on a variety of subjects and starts getting silly and distracting.<br /><br />I don’t want to give up on this series since I’ve been following it for a long time. It is a quick, clean, cozy mystery with some touching moments and interesting amateur sleuthing. However, I would recommend readers new to the series start with the books earlier in the series that had more content with stories that flowed better. I have hopes that the quality of these books goes back to what it used to be with more detailed stories and less filler. I also hope Hannah is able to quickly heal from her past heartache and find happiness in the romance department.<br /><br />I received this ebook from NetGalley through the courtesy of Kensington Books.

"An Engrossing Page Turner About Race, Class and Bullying","Granted, I've never been a fan of Gossip Girl (both books and the series), and while I enjoyed Get Out, it isn't amongst my all-time favorite films. However between the incredibly awesome cover and the premise, I really wanted to see just how these two disparate elements could possibly work together.<br /><br />Well...it's a lot. Racism, bullying, homophobia, class issues...a LOT.<br /><br />I'm still trying to gather my thoughts, so bear with me here.<br /><br />I'd say this novel has more in common with Selah and the Spades, than Gossip Girl but that's just me.<br /><br />***<br /><br />""In this kingdom, the queen doesn't inherit the crown. To get to the top, she destroys whoever she needs to. Here, every moment is crucial; there are no do-overs. One mistake can have you sent to the bottom of the food chain with the girls who have imaginary boyfriends and wear polyester ironically. It sounds dramatic, but this is the way things are and the way they will always be.""<br /><br />Chiamaka Adebayo is the Nigerian-Italian American, overachieving and scheming student at the prestigious Niveus Academy aka the prep school from hell. Chiamaka is wealthy, smart and on her way to Yale through sheer will and grades. She's the proverbial queen bee and while not a bully herself, doesn't suffer fools gladly. What friends she has (and I use the term ""friends"" loosely) are merely there as accessories, a fact they know and resent.<br /><br />""Maintaining popularity at a place like Niveus is not about how many friends you have. It's about looking the part, having the best grades, and dating the right people. You have to make everyone wish they were you, wish they had your life. I know to an outsider, it seems horrible--making people self-conscious, feeding off their envy, destroying anyone who gets in your way--but I learned early on that it's either kill or be killed. And if I had to stop and feel bad for every instance I've had to step on someone's toes to keep the crown, I'd be very bored.""<br /><br />Seriously, this book really didn't need anything else because as unlikeable as Chiamaka tries to be, I couldn't help rooting for her. She knows who she is and what her goals are. She knows the game and has played it fabulously.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she's had to make a lot of compromises in order to fit in the lily-white world she's found herself in, and those compromises are ones that many Black people in such surroundings can relate to. Black people are often told by their family and friends that we have to be not just as good as white people, but *better* just to be considered equal. It's an unfair burden (amongst many) and it's one Chiamaka struggles with even as she feels she's bested the lion in its own den. And though she's done everything a white supremacist system would consider to be ""right"", she's still Black.<br /><br />This is Chiamaka's last year and she's been made Senior Head Prefect, the icing on an already elaborate cake. She's got the grades, the perfect boyfriend, the wardrobe, the hair, the house and wealthy doctor parents. What else is left?<br /><br />""Even though I know I shouldn't care, it annoys me that when girls know what they want and how they're going to get it, they're seen as cocky. But guys who know what they want? They're confident or strong.""<br /><br />While this is the pinnacle of her hard-fought success at Niveus, it also is the beginning of a frightening downward spiral due to forces she cannot understand nor control.<br /><br />Nor is she the only victim.<br /><br />Devon Richards is the only other Black student at Niveus besides Chiamaka and they do NOT run in the same circles. They are opposites in almost every other way, and Devon finds himself shocked at being named a Senior Prefect:<br /><br />""I know things like Senior Prefects are a popularity contest. Teachers vote for their favorites each year, and it's always the same kind of person. Someone popular, and I am not popular. Maybe my music teacher put in a good word for me? I don't know.""<br /><br />Devon is that scholarship student with the good grades, and a passion to do well in order to justify the sacrifices his hard-working single mom is making. He's also from the wrong side of the tracks and he's gay. He feels like a fish out of water at Niveus, surrounded by so much wealth and privilege. His only outlet is music and he's set on attending Julliard. And sometimes to make ends meet, he has to do things his very religious yet caring mother would not want him to do. She needs for him to not worry about ""adult things"" but where he's from, there's really no room for childhood.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the same forces arrayed against Chiamaka are out to get him as well. These two people who only know of each other in passing have to join forces to find out just who's stalking them and why. Suddenly trusted friends have become enemies, lovers turned into strangers and even supportive teachers are showing their true faces and the only people Chiamaka and Devon can rely on are themselves and each other.<br /><br />The bullying takes on a frightening and dangerous life of its own as even the relative safety of the world outside of the claustrophobic walls of Niveus are drawn into the web of deceit and danger.<br /><br />However, revenge is also a dish best served cold...not to mention, outliving the tormentors.<br /><br />For anyone who believes it's impossible for the kinds of racialized bullying to occur that happened in this novel, I highly suggest reading (or watching) The Lords of Discipline by the late Pat Conroy. While it's a fictional account of the targeting of one of VMI's first Black cadets, the fact is Black students - especially in historically white settings - deal with organized bullying in varying degrees.",4.0,1,2021

Not exactly realistic in some ways.,"I’ve read the series. The stories are entertaining. The problem I have is that for hundreds of years in the future, most of the tech isn’t advanced past the 20th century (& I DO mean 20th, not 21st). These people are 100’s in the years in the future. They live with more advanced species. The fact that they haven’t advanced to a more tech advantageous state is downright depressing. You’d think that they would have at least reverse engineered some of the other species tech.<br />Also I wish it was explained how a space zeppelin is supposed to work. There’s a mention of solar winds, but what’s supposed to be in the balloon part? How does it function & what are the advantages?<br />They are using something that sounds like a flip phone.

"Entertaining, G-rated, single-dad-and-nanny, romantic comedy","This cute romcom is written from the alternating first-person points of view of twenty-something, Brooke, and 30-year-old Bradford (Mac) McCoy.<br /><br />After receiving some really bad news (which it would be a spoiler to reveal), Brooke recently quit her job in Los Angeles as a kindergarten teacher, ended her lukewarm engagement, and fled to her best friend and former college roommate, Emi, who lives in the small town of Apple Valley, Oregon. Emi is a librarian at the Edward R. McCoy library, and the only employment Brooke could find, in a very limited job market, is the job that Emi helped her get at her library, as a part-time security guard. Unfortunately, Brooke’s boss is a nitpicky control freak who has frequently threatened to fire Brooke for spending too much time being friendly to the patrons of the library. And he finally does fire her, on the day she meets Mac.<br /><br />Mac’s wannabe-actress ex-wife deserted him and his daughter, Daisy, one year ago on Daisy’s fourth birthday, and their divorce has just become final. The trauma of her mother’s abandonment has caused Daisy to withdraw into herself all this time, refusing to laugh or talk. In addition, Mac is currently struggling with taking over the job of CEO of his father’s hugely successful construction company—a job he never wanted—when he inherited ownership of it after his father’s recent, sudden death. In addition to his sorrow at losing his father, Mac’s mother, who has provided childcare for Daisy for the past year, has just moved, apparently permanently, to New York to care for Mac’s grandmother. Desperately in need of a nanny, Mac is immediately drawn to Brooke as an ideal choice, because the attractive security guard has accomplished a miracle. She has caused Daisy to laugh. Unfortunately, in the process, her boss fires her for the manner in which she has achieved that feat—by playfully tossing tiny pieces of plastic fruit at Daisy and Mac. Mac is determined to fix that issue for Brooke, because it is in large part due to him and Daisy. But he is equally determined to convince Brooke, when he discovers she is a former kindergarten teacher, to become Daisy’s nanny.<br /><br />This cute romance is a quick, entertaining read. The author has a sprightly voice, and all of the characters are vividly drawn. Brooke and Mac are very sympathetic protagonists, and Daisy is adorable.<br /><br />This romance novel is G-rated, with no smoking, drinking, cussing, or sex. Given that fact, it is very impressive that the author successfully manages to convincingly arrive at the hero’s marriage proposal (in the expected HEA of any romance novel) without the couple having done more than share a couple of kisses. Not every author of a no-sex romance manages to pull off this difficult feat, especially when, as is the case of this book, it is a secular romance.<br /><br />I rate this novel as follows:<br /><br />Heroine: 4 stars<br />Hero: 4 stars<br />Subcharacters: 4 stars<br />Romance Plot: 4 stars<br />Heroine’s Personal Crisis Plot: 3 stars<br />Hero’s Personal Crisis Plot: 4 stars<br />Writing: 4 stars<br />Overall: 4 stars",4.0,1,2021
"how root canals work... and dont work. Worthwhile, informative, easy to understand resource","Such an informative read. I have been staying up way past my bedtime these past couple nights as I couldnt put the book down. It reads well, has easy to follow and understand information, and it is eye opening. Plenty of references and other medical science to back up the information. Glad to see some pioneers in dentistry mentioned (Weston Price).<br /><br />The electronic copy is perfectly fine, but I should have purchased the paperback copy. I tend to prefer a hard copy in hand when it comes to reference books, but I wasn't sure if this was something that would be worth adding to my library, so I went with the cheapest option (which happened to be the Kindle option as the paperback was nearly double in price at time of purchase). WOW, I think I need to buy the paper copy too. I say this because it is easier to refer back on a physical book than it is on an e:reader--for me. Figured I would say this in case you are at all like me.<br /><br />I have, well HAD two teeth that had root canal therapy. I had been suspect of the procedure and subsequent presenting systemic health issue/s. When trying to figure something out, I'm one to follow the logic, follow the science, and also follow the money. Sometimes it has been a challenge to find info since most of the time I saw mention of any of this only on blogs and sites that are way too ""woo"" for me. So while I was suspect of the procedure, I have been suspect of the information sources. This book pleases me. I have been sniffing around the long term effect of root canaled teeth for several years now. Part of me didn't want to know too much because I was living with two teeth received this ""therapy"". Not like I was going to be able to just have them taken out. Or would I?<br /><br />This time last week, I had those molars removed. Both on the left side of my mouth, one upper and one lower. What precipitated this is that I had a bump form on the gum at the lower root canaled tooth. 2D and 3D imaging showed shadowing and a crack- so infection and a compromised tooth structure. It was in looking at this tooth, that a similar shadowing was shown in the upper root canaled molar. It was determined in the spot that these teeth would have to come out. OK!! While I wasn't keen on going through this, and I knew I would want an implant in the lower (second to last molar, so more chomping than say the upper which is last molar), and the expense would be nearly $5K, I knew it would be a GOOD thing. I also knew I never want another root canal ever again- extract and put in an implant.<br /><br />So a week later, I sit here with 2 less teeth. Upper was just extracted and given a couple dissolvable stitches. The lower (which will get implant), had a bone graft and stitches to be removed in 3 more weeks. Just finished a round of antibiotics. Healing seems to be going well. I'm amping up my antioxidants, especially vitamin C (and recently ordered some liposomal C).<br /><br />Will I notice any improvement to health? Has the root canal therapy contributed to any of the health issues I have been dealing with since having said therapy? I'm curious! It could be placebo, and it could be the fact that I haven't been eating much (especially sugar), so I am not sure if my boost in energy is attributed to the actual removal or not. I am keeping track. I have other metrics I will be paying attention to (BP, especially), and the timing happens to be around the time that I will be getting lab work done as well as regular doctors visit. I will be letting them know about my extractions. Curious if they will have comment. Medical doctors and dentists need to have more overlap<br /><br />I tend to keep up with my reviews, but I am especially keen on doing so here if I learn or experience anything worth sharing.<br /><br />I think this is a worthwhile read. I truly may try to pick up a paper copy so I can make easier notes and be able to refer back. If I had any suugestions, it would be to include more pics, or greater primer on the physical tooth. But the lack of that is minimal compared to the wealth of info on how root canals work... and dont work.",5.0,1,2021

Disappointing,"I started out quite enjoying this family saga but my enjoyment turned to frustration half way through for several reasons: There were too many red herrings, there were too many incomplete conversations, there were too many unlikeable characters and there were no BIG reveals. In fact, reading in my online Book Club, as I did, many of us had already 20% in to the story concluded the BIG Twist.<br />This book goes back and forth from when Holly was a child and Amy, the child her parents take in, comes to live with them.<br />Holly, as a main character was frustrating to the point that I wanted to shake her. She is married to Jordan and they have two children Marley and BB. Concerned about Marley's sudden change in behaviour, Holly introduces a Worry Box for Marley to leave notes in, which Marley takes advantage of. Unfortunately Holly never clarifies what Marley means by her notes which becomes the main theme of this story. Conversations that start and never end in a satisfactory way. The story was filled with unlikeable characters, at the helm Adam, Holly's father and Amy, not to mention Amy's parents Isabel and Luke, and even Jordan, but this in itself never affects my rating as a really gripping and good story is often jammed with unlikeable people. In this book however I was left feeling deflated. A slow burn.",3.0,0,2021
Meh,"I love the maximum ride books, but after the 3rd it really dropped for me but I still loved all the rest for what they were and the enjoyment of getting to enjoy these characters and their interactions. I was excited when Hawk came out, and I like Hawk in its own ways, its fun to see where these characters are grown up and their daughter. I think the best parts of the Hawk book were seeing Hawk and the flock mix and have those moments and we really dont get much of that at ALL, Max and Fang are barely in this book and the flock is really not there at all except in brief mentions. I know these books are now having Hawk as the focus and not Max or the flock, but I feel like its so empty without them. The characters seem to not give much to be attached to and invested in. There is something missing that these books used to have, I have read all the maximum ride books through Hawk over and over and over, even ones that were not particularly my favorite but this one I don't think I will reread because there is just not really ANYTHING to really want to revisit. Im ok with moving away focus from Max and the flock, but it just doesn't stand up on its own so to not have Max or the flock in it much at all it doesn't have much to redeem it",2.0,0,2021
Logic did not reign in the development of this plot.,"Ok, we have a ""barbarian"" who seems more civilized than the bandits who captured him.  Worse, why where the bandits so far from their own home and so close to the barbarian's to begin with?  I mean the barbarians had ventured into wild territory to hunt and kill a magical being to harvest alchemical ingredients to brew a serum to save their village.  but on the way home they get stopped by a large group of soldiers who capture our erstwhile hero and force him to fight in the arena or die.<br /><br />And the lack of logic spirals from there.  The villains are almost comical in their ineptitude and in their illogic.  Things happen that had me wondering when the villains had removed their earpieces giving them the ""breathe in, breathe out"" instruction to keep them alive.<br /><br />Yes, once again I did not care for the villains, which meant that while the story isn't bad, it had to be carried by the characters and this one didn't manage that.  I just couldn't find them interesting enough to keep me from pondering the plot.<br /><br />Its not bad, but it should have been much, much better.",3.0,0,2021
Darwin was right,"I’m about a third of the way through this well-researched and thoroughly depressing book. I would give it five stars, but it's way too long for the simple message it delivers. A nod to brevity fo such a simple message would be good.<br /><br />I keep waiting for an epiphany, either mine or the author’s. Skipping ahead like I might with an Agatha Christie novel that I don’t have time to finish. At the end of every chapter I’m thinking “Okay...and?”<br /><br />Okay, so we have the politics of resentment to blame, coupled with the cynical appeal—pandering really—to that resentment by the very elite demographic that they so dislike. Not the Cambridge, Berkeley and New Haven elites, but the white, blond, well-educated New York media millionaires that Fox News mints with disturbing regularity. Got it. And?<br /><br />In the final analysis, these people are angry at the “line cutters.”  Which in the 21st century— likely the last century of the planet's failed ""human race"" experiment—makes as much sense as it did in 2nd grade where the concept originates. They vote against self interest out of petty grade school resentments. Oh right. They're also angry at people who aren't white.<br /><br />And that is the fault of “coastal elites?” The angry racists bear no responsibility at all? Got it.<br /><br />Apparently, the angry white male—or at least the Southern angry white male—is sure going to show them. As he slowly—or in some cases, quickly—kills himself and his family, and destroys his entire world out of a petty resentment aimed at, but ironically created by, other angry white males (the wealthy, educated ones) in New York, LA, Boston and Berkeley. Got it.<br /><br />But as we’ve been hearing with some regularity since Covid started, “science doesn’t care what you think.” Neither does evolution. Adapt or die. So much of this white male angry resentment often just seems like the melodramatic death throes of a suicidal monster from a 1950’s horror movie. Pogo said, “we have met the enemy and he is us.” They’re dying out, are mad about it, want everyone to know, and don’t care even a little bit about their impact on the rest of the planet. But don’t, dear reader, lose the plot: The “line cutters” are the problem, and it is up to the rest of us to scale the “empathy wall” and understand that. Noted.<br /><br />Call me crazy, but for some reason, I don’t think that empathy is going to accomplish much. The monster is addicted to its anger and resentment, self-destructively resistant to common sense and appeals to self interest, proud of its stubbornness and-lovingly coddled--ignorance, and doesn’t care what the impact of any of that is on the rest of the human race. Just like a poor, misunderstood, drug addict. Destroying every thing, person, place or event he encounters in his blood lust for what feeds his monster. ""Poor me, poor me, poor me...Pour me a drink and give me back my keys.""<br /><br />The question is how much of the rest of us is this monster going to take down before it groans its final death rattle. Can the best of homo sapiens survive its very worst and most destructive members?  Stay tuned. I’m not optimistic, and I have zero faith that empathy matters.<br /><br />None of which is the messenger's fault or responsibility. Great book. Depressing message.",4.0,1,2021
"Awesome, but…","4 stars *I think*<br /><br />I think this might have been my least favorite of the series, but since I loved all the books that doesn’t mean too much. Here are some of my complaints:<br /><br />I wish we were able to get a satisfactory ending for Vargas, I feel like he was a thread left hanging, an unresolved plot line, a loose end. He’s gotta find a new body? How’s that going to work out? Where is he gonna get a body? How long is this going to take? Will his mate recognize him? I detest when authors do this to readers. It feels like a cheap ploy to get us to read their next series.<br /><br />I don’t feel like the relationship between Fallon and Arden was very well done. First of all, there wasn’t a good resolution to the issue of him disappearing and ignoring her for the last half of the second book and the first half of this one. Arden just got tired of being mad. Fallon never even apologized, he just gave excuses. Also, they were supposed to be mates, but they didn’t have any sort of tangible mate bond, not like she had with Valerian. They just got a little tingly when they touched…?<br /><br />There were a few other issues, specifically regarding the next Prime being the primal sources connected to the sanctuaries…that doesn’t particularly make sense. Especially since the primal sources connected to the sanctuaries don’t seem to strengthen the cadre, only the building itself. How is that going to help the masses? It won’t even help the cadres once they leave the property. This resolution won’t keep the balance between free will and obedience. It makes no sense. Needless to say, I was dissatisfied with that resolution as well. Also, the Primal Source threatens to be watching Arden…why? She’s not the prime, she doesn’t have the prime power…? She refused it and allocated it elsewhere. So why do they need to watch her? This was not well thought out.<br /><br />Will Arden ever learn to use her elf magic? She ignores it 99% of the time and she’s as weak a baby elf. She doesn’t even show interest in learning. Elf magic lessons seemed to be a brief plot devise in an earlier book to give Arden time to bond with Fallon. Once he flaked it was never mentioned again.<br /><br />What’s going to happen to the light elf kingdom? What about the old king? Is he alive or dead? Was there a new king chosen? Nobody knows. That was left unresolved as well. Another loose thread.<br /><br />How about Arden’s dad and the whole dark elf king business? Is Arden a princess now? It was never mentioned. Is she now heir to the dark elf throne? Idk. Is she not ‘elf enough’ to be his heir? Does he need to have more kids? Will the magic choose his successor instead? We get no answers. #loosethreads<br /><br />I think I was dissatisfied with a lot of the resolutions to the  various storylines. There were too many loose ends that weren’t addressed. Several things didn’t seem well thought out or had holes in the reasoning.",4.0,1,2021
"Important but incremental addition to ""Method of No-Method""","Comparison to the earlier work where Guo translated his master's work  (Method of No-Method) is unavoidable.  Both are very pithy explanations and positioning of the Chan tradition.  The directness and simplicity is apparent in both books.  The difference (for a secular person like me) is mostly stylistic and not necessarily new content or interpretations.  The earlier work of Sheng Yen was presented almost as a day by day transcript of a retreat.  Here, Guo takes a different approach but covers almost identical material.  Guo attempts to define the key concepts and the building blocks for a meditation practice very systematically.  Guo expands the central theme of Chan (we are already free; self-referential grasping and rejecting conceals that freedom) in a logical manner with simple analogies and then offers practical instructions on how to incorporate such ideas in daily life and practice.<br /><br />(At the time of this review, the table of contents are not accessible; here is a quick note on the structure of the book.  Part I (7 chapters) provides the key concepts and practice instructionsl  Part II (3 chapters) provides commentaries on a few excerpts from Hongzhi's ""Extended Discourse Records"" and Part III is a translation of excerpts from Hongzhi's classic)<br /><br />This short, pithy book along with ""Method of No-Method"" is sufficient for a beginner to initiate and sustain a meditation practice.  For the more experienced reader, this will serve as an excellent refresher and a quick way to challenge ones understanding of the method.  4.5*",5.0,1,2021

A bit oversimplified,"Don't get me wrong. I'm not expecting an exhaustive, detailed history of a period encompassing a couple thousand years in the span of a couple hundred pages.

Not only were the Balkans referred to as the ""powder keg"" of Europe, Bismarck himself, in speaking of the war he felt inevitable, quite famously said that it would likely be set off by ""some damn foolish thing in the Balkans.""<br /><br />This is but one example, and perhaps some will think it minor.

A PAGE TURNER FROM A WONDERFUL AUTHOR,"I have read other books by Angela Petch and loved them all but this was, by far, my favorite.  It was a nice, long, book - 400 pages that I read on my Kindle and I literally flew through the pages in 3 days.  I couldn't put it down!!!<br /><br />I am Italian and love all things Italian, including and especially books about Italy in WWII.  This book was about Richard, an Englishman who was a pacifist working in the Friends (Quaker) Ambulance Unit (FAU) where he cared for injured on either side.  It is about Fosca, a young woman whose husband was a resistance fighter who was killed by the Nazis.  It is about Fosca's young son, Giampiero, who was cared for by the nuns while Fosca herself assisted the resistance.  It is about the nuns who raised Fosca and cared for Giampiero.  It is about the death of Simonetta, Fosca's best friend, who was a resistance fighter.  The action goes back and forth between 1944 and 1947 in Tuscany where Richard returns to heal his war torn soul.<br /><br />The book is painfully honest about the privations of the Italian people during the war and immediately afterward.  The hunger and desperation are clearly discussed and, as the story progresses into the years after the war, the beauty of the country and the delicious food and wine made me wish that I could return to Italy.  Another thing I loved about the book was the humanness of the characters.  Richard and Fosca were both flawed, made mistakes, had regrets and moved ahead with their lives into a time of peace in the beauty of Tuscany.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book that I strongly recommend.  I also recommend any book written by Angela Petch.",5.0,1,2021

"A thought provoking, pensive, slow-burn, reflective take on what the future could hold..","Ishiguro provides a very unique take on AI - almost humanizing in a realistic way.  While the narrative is slow paced, the vividness with which Ishiguro describes the settings, thoughts and intents of the characters allows a reader to have a very immersive experience.  As the plot develops, Ishiguro is able to develop a very interesting narrative arc that spans a multitude of emotions - hopefulness, innocent curiosity, desire to learn and explore, social connections/friendship and a host of topics related to existence.  Themes on loneliness tend to dominate, though.<br /><br />As the novel began, I thought it could be similar to the movie ""Her"" or even the novel ""Machines like me"" with a sharper focus on teens/child characters.  But thankfully, there wasn't too much similarity.  Some themes from ""Black Mirror"" can also be recognized as the plot develops.  However,  this novel seems to use AI as a impartial mirror to humanity and inviting us to draw our own conclusions about human nature.<br /><br />A brilliant book that will leave you feeling a bit sad, a bit wiser, and more observant.",5.0,1,2021

The Saving Grace is the Plot,"""Here is my dilemma: my passion is, at best, someone else's guilty pleasure.""<br /><br />This book was really hard to rate because I actually found the premise quite interesting. On their graduation night, the whole senior class of this high school competes in this treasure hunt across the city of Seattle, and our two MCs - who're long-time rivals - end up forced into a position where they need to team up. I gotta say, my own senior class absolutely would not have done this but the idea is cool.<br /><br />The plot is, sadly, the only thing I enjoyed about this book.<br /><br />My main issue with the text, and the cause of the 2-star rating, is the POV character, Rowan. I found her deeply unlikeable and not even in that fun way where unlikable characters can still be entertaining to read. She just came across as super self-righteous and self-absorbed. This is a coming-of-age novel, so it would've been no big deal if the character evolved out of these traits through the course of the story, but I didn't really feel like she did. She also has a big chip on her shoulder about wanting to be a romance novelist but people not respecting that type of writer. Maybe I'm just being naive, but considering the Romance Novel Writers of America have stated that romance novels are a 1.08 BILLION dollar a year industry, I don't really think it's like, a joke of a career.<br /><br />Another issue that I had with the text is that the author made it VERY clear what her opinions are on many current political and social issues. And it's not even that I disagree with her opinions -the whole purpose of art is to offer different ways of viewing the world - it's just that they weren't woven into the text in a way that felt organic. It read like ""story, story, story, topical content, story, story, story."" It just pulled me out of the text in a way that I think could've been avoided if those ideas had been woven more deftly into other aspects of the story.",2.0,0,2021
I should have listened to my instincts,"Now, I'll start by admitting that I looked over the reviews of others and was hesitant to try this book.<br /><br />And then I read the blurb about it and saw things that made me even more hesitant to try this book.<br /><br />But I ignored my worries and..... now wish I had never purchased this book.<br /><br />Its not that the book could truly be said to be badly written.  However, it plays to a number of plot tropes that I dislike and which resulted in problems I decry in reviews whenever I see them.<br /><br />And its why I actually avoid a lot of LitRPG books after reading the blurbs.  There were two main ways that the initial plot/character turned me off in a hurry.  The first was the ""terminally ill/dead MC who has his brain uploaded into a permanent VR world.""  This is not uncommon as its used in many series to help set up the story of why someone is entering a LitRPG situation.  However, I compare that to the ones where the person is taken to a new world that doesn't in theory have a computer running it, and the ones that are worlds always seem to have more character and life.  And this story with the very unusual start definitely reminded me of why I have avoided the ""I died and ended up in a video game"" tales.<br /><br />The second was the unbelievable power of the MC.  He starts out gaining poison resistances like they were going out of style.  This and his ability to imprint classes, cultivation techniques, etc, made him far more powerful than even the mostly OP LitRPG protagonists in stories that don't have the ""I died to become an OP character in a poorly plotted self-insert story."" trope hanging over them.<br /><br />And that's what drives my review here.  The main character is too powerful, despite his rocky origin.  The others he meets are tropes on a page, lacking any level of nuance and character that would make me want to read about them.  Heck there isn't really much character development early as the story jumps from the ship where the MC is ""born"" to a dock where an immediate trial for murder starts, to the journey to the top of the cliff where the gods come down to interpose their twisted justice on the landscape.  (Notice that there were no pauses for reflection and character development?)<br /><br />Just not my cup of tea and not what I want to read.  Others might love this, but I found it to be poorly thought out with an MC that I disliked.  Its firmly a ""do not recommend this book"", and those get 2 stars or less from me.",2.0,0,2021

Edge of your seat suspenseful!,"I recently read The Bratva’s Locked up Love: A Bratva Captive Romance by Jagger Cole. For me, this novel was extremely realistic and suspenseful. It literally kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Let me explain a little about my background. Today, I am a retired public school teacher, but I have some educational “experience” with the penal system. For example, when I did my student teaching at a large middle school, part of the co-teaching curriculum entailed taking 100 students on a trip to a large local two year jail. (Around this time was when “Scared Straight” came about on TV.) There we toured the “school” in the jail and the students learned the high recidivism rate of criminals who do not graduate from high school or get their GED.  We walked through one tier of the jail, which was scary as all hell when the incarcerated men yelled all kinds of profanities at the students and teachers. As a college senior doing my student teaching, I had a dress code to follow and wore a suit with matching skirt, below the knee. It was an awful experience for me walking with the students through the tier of the jail that day and hearing the catcalls. I was shaking inside, but I had to act strong for my students. Doctor Quinn Coolidge was brave and naïve to wear the skirt around the male prisoners and guards, especially with her proximity to incarcerated patients. When we arrived to tour the jail, we were warned that if anything happened during our visit, we would be locked in a room for safety. When moving a female prisoner, she managed break loose and the jail went on lockdown; we were quickly ushered into a room and locked in which was pretty scary for middle school students. All in all, the trip was memorable for all students, even the so-called “tough” students who “thought” they were bad-asses.<br /><br />As a young teacher scrambling to make ends meet, I taught several summers in a youth correction center. One summer I taught girls at a maximum security facility and another summer I taught boys in a minimum security facility. The first day on the job as a teacher, we learned self-defense techniques that would save us but not hurt the student. For example, what to do if a student pulls your hair from the back or puts you in a choke hold. The girls were extremely combative with each other. It was very challenging to teach them; I did not last that whole summer teaching the girls. ☹ When teaching the boys, there was more respect for a female teacher, but there were strict protocols that the male students could not get within a teacher’s personal “bubble of space” (measured by holding my hands out straight and to the side). Students varied in age from 14 to 18 years old and some would try to get “handsy.” Pencils were counted and passed out at the beginning of a class, and the same number had to be returned—a pencil was contraband out of the classroom and could be used as a weapon. Guards would be around to assist if needed. I really appreciated when one would hang around my afternoon classes because they were especially rough. Once a thunder storm hit in the afternoon and the facility lost power; we went into lockdown in the school. I am not going to lie, I was petrified. Luckily a guard was in my room thank goodness, because the lockdown lasted over an hour. I know how scared and wary I felt in these experiences, so I can relate to some of the fear Quinn felt trying to maintain her idealism in her profession but walking a fine line of keeping herself safe while helping her patients with medical tools that could be weapons in the wrong hands.<br /><br />When the tension between Quinn and prisoner 5049/Maksim heats up, I was panicking because I really had no idea if 5049/Maksim would harm her in any way, especially with the prison guards’ description of him being an “animal.” So many twists and turns to this plot also had my stomach doing flip-flopping as I agonized over Quinn’s safety every step of the way.

My friends say nonsense that I once would echo and they are probably completely unaware of the great works by Thomas, Dinesh and how they are connected to the spiritual teaching of those like Eckhart Tolle and others who know the collectivist vs individualist struggle which has been covered up and hidden with a massive campaign of misinformation that lures our youth into being animals who have our noises pointed upward based on a egotistic foundation of understanding; hoodwinked into being pawns for the very evil we (millennials mostly) heroically proclaim to be against and privy to...unlike the boomers..., whom we disrespect.

Poor!,"I cannot believe how many 5 and 4 star reviews the book got! It was a painful, slow-burn with a pathetic main character. Tess is an experienced theater sister yet jumps into a marriage after dating a man (Daniel) for two months who she literally knows nothing about. He is a consulting surgeon. She only meets his parents for the first time at her wedding.<br /><br />She also ups from London to Bath two weeks after the marriage without prior knowledge into a seven-bedroom old home. The house is furnished in a style that is unattractive and dated and smells but she is not even permitted to wash the curtains. Most concerning is her tolerance of Daniel bruising, burning and forcing himself on her sexually. He also takes away her phone and blames her for a patient's death for which he clearly was responsible. When she finds a hidden notebook under the mattress that chronicles abuse of the former lady of the house, she chooses to read it bit by bit over weeks. Totally implausible when it's been suggested to her that the former lady was Daniel's first wife!<br /><br />In tandem another story is told of an elderly lady with the onset of dementia trying to warn Tess of what Daniel did to his first wife. I admired my resolve to complete this book but could quite happily have left if early on. 2 stars!",2.0,0,2021
Not for me,"I just couldn’t get past the hero in this book. He was so shallow and basic that I couldn’t stop rolling my eyes. He starts out the book proposing to a girl who just turned 21 (he’s 35) that he knew he wasn’t in love with, because the only characteristic he cared about in a wife was that she was young and hot. He’d known the heroine his whole life and was never attracted to her because she *gasp* liked to read and didn’t throw herself at him. He was every kind of cliche of a bro-dude player type. I kept picturing one of the douchebags off of the reality show “The Jersey Shore” because honestly that’s how he acted.  There was really no character growth. He couldn’t even admit that he “might” love the heroine, and actually want a real relationship with her until the end of the book. Just not an enjoyable read as I was not attracted to this hero AT ALL",2.0,0,2021
"Nuanced, rich, emotional read","Holy crap this guy is good. I just read The Gunkle and wanted more, so I read The Editor, which is the story of a young man (early 30s) whose novel wins the attention of an important publishing house. He's assigned to work with an editor. He doesn't realize, until she comes into the office, that it's JACKIE KENNEDY ONASSIS.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed ""seeing"" the life of this great woman as imagined by the author. The detail with which he describes both ""JO"" (the office nickname for her) and her office and homes is so rich, it's hard to believe he didn't know her. Clearly, he did his research.<br /><br />James isn't any kind of hero, but he's a good person. His relationship with Daniel is a story unto itself as they achieve professional success--James is self-centered, whereas Daniel is a rock, practical and generous, but ultimately he has his red line, too.<br /><br />As James works with Mrs. Onassis, as he calls her, a friendship develops, and she pushes him, not just as an author but in his personal life (because it'll help his writing or because she's a mother, too? The latter is implied), to address his fractured relationship with his mother. The latter issue is the actual story, because Mom has kept a stunning secret for years. Is she a hero or a selfish weakling? The novel is about James coming to terms with his mom, and vice versa.<br /><br />Jackie is clearly a stand-in for James' mother, and when at the end they inscribe their books for each other, it's incredibly moving. As I read the ending, I needed half a box of tissues, but it was a good cry. Thank you, Steven Rowley.",5.0,1,2021
Eighteen year old pheromone generator with superpowers gains a harem.... YAWN,"This is a wish-fulfillment/fantasy tale.  The MC starts out as a 11 year old ""orphan"" with a dying father getting to go to some academy for young men and women wanting to work in space.  Just a few more chapters in and he's eighteen and about to be given a used spaceship so he can engage in a special diplomatic mission.  He's already got two girls who will be stripping off and dragging him into bed (and the shower, and the...) as soon as they have any privacy, and soon a third sex crazed girl will join.<br /><br />But don't think these are mindless bimbos.  Although they are quick to demand sex with the MC each one is highly trained and skilled giving him a great crew and an ability to take a poorly designed cubical trading ship into battle and win.<br /><br />So we have a tale with too much sex (that was about as erotic as watching grass grow.  I'm sorry to say this, but the author definitely needs practice on this - although it was rather standard fare for a harem tale.)  Then it had plastic characters much of the time, and a plot that lacked gravitas.<br /><br />Add in the surprise origin of our orphan MC which of course gives him phenomenal cosmic powers (patent pending), and its just nothing special as a story.<br /><br />As a first ever effort it is not bad, but it is very clearly a first effort.  Sadly, while I see talent in the writing and a certain level of imagination, the experience needed in story crafting just wasn't there.  Good for lovers of the genre, but doesn't really shine as a story.",3.0,0,2021
"Misleading title. Not an eBook version of the original pamphlet ""Welcome Newcomer!"" [K-10]","I was thrilled to see that Al-Anon had finally joined the other fellowships who made their newcomer pamphlet available long ago on electronic platforms. But this is not an eBook version of their newcomer pamphlet. It is an almost entirely new, and much less informative publication.<br /><br />This is not an electronic version of ""Welcome Newcomer! [K-10]"". It has very little that appears in the paper of the same name. Missing is the text of almost all the pieces in the paper pamphlet.  ""What Do You Do About the Alcoholic's Drinking?"", ""So You Love an Alcoholic"", ""Understanding Ourselves and Alcoholism"", the ""Just for Today"" and ""Sponsorship"" bookmarks, ""Al-Anon Spoken Here"" and ""Alateens Share with Adults in Their Lives."" are not included.  Only excerpts from ""Information for the Newcomer"" are included.<br /><br />Edit: October 2021<br />I notice that several of the positive reviews are not verified purchases. It makes me wonder what they are reviewing, since this eBook is not available in paper form. I know that publicity for this publication gave the impression that this eBook was a duplicate of the  complete newcomers pamphlet, so perhaps they reviewed without actually reading this publication. Perhaps they have never seen the actual newcomers pamphlet. I assure them that the actual paper newcomer pamphlet has classics of Al-Anon literature which have proved helpful to newcomers and long time members for many, many years.<br /><br />Anyone who actually compared this to the paper version of the pamphlet would see that this eBook is not at all the newcomers pamphlet that groups have used to welcome newcomers before. Our group found that we can mail a complete newcomer paper Welcome Newcomer! [K-10] for just 78 cents postage.  You can also links to various freely available Al-Anon websites. Those are much more useful than this eBook.<br /><br />If you are newcomer to Al-Anon and want some instantly available Al-Anon information you might consider purchasing the Kindle versions of one of the daily readers (One Day at a Time in Al-Anon, Courage to Change or Hope for Today) or How Al-Anon Works.

Where's the Beef???,Reminiscent of the 1970's Black Belt magazine articles. The photography is very low resolution and not detailed to any serious instructional standards that I am aware of. The Bubishi theory and explanation of techniques is glanced over only in the most basic format. It is a quantum leap from reading this material to application of the actual Bubishi teachings.<br />They used the buzz word Bubishi to suck you in but fail to deliver anything of substance.

Fantastic!!!,Kiersten Modglin posted today that this book released and I knew I had to read it. It had me at Chapter 1 and I never put it down. The story drew me in and had me guessing constantly. The length of the story was absolutely perfect and all the info was important. I hate long books that have a bunch of pointless info in them. The characters were great and the twists were so so good! In some cases I was putting myself in the characters place seeing what I would do in those circumstances. Kiersten doesn’t disappoint.

Still Relevant Today,"It’s the 1940’s.  A young Black man named Fred Daniels is arrested and accused of a double murder.  The police don’t care if he’s innocent.  From the moment they pick him up, he’s their guy. No evidence needed. He’s young, Black, and was in close proximity to where the crime took place. That’s all they need. The first few chapters are a all-too-real tale of racial injustice.  Written around 80 years ago, the opening of “The Man Who Lived Underground” should feel dated.  Unfortunately, it feels a lot like a story ripped from the headlines today.<br /><br />Hours after being taken into custody, Fred is beaten down by the police and forced to sign a confession, admitting to the murders. Knowing he’ll die for the crimes he didn’t commit, he seizes on an opportunity to escape and slips down a manhole into the sewer system beneath the city streets.  Once underground, he tunnels through brick and enters the basements of various businesses, observing people and taking the valuable objects he finds.  What held meaning above-ground becomes merely symbolic to Fred as he adjusts to a new world below.<br /><br />Read by itself, “The Man Who Lived Underground” can be viewed as an existential novel – a man shedding the culture and values of the above-ground world and gaining a new perspective of self.  However, when paired with Wright’s essay about his grandmother (included at the end), the book clearly becomes an allegory for religion and the religious.  While the themes of racial injustice and inequality become more subtle and symbolic in nature after the first few chapters, they’re still present in the different basements he tunnels into.<br /><br />For me personally, “The Man Who Lived Underground” is a stark reminder of how little progress we’ve actually made against racial injustice and how far we need to go. Written almost a century ago, it should be a sad, chilling reminder of our history, yet it’s still relatable. Parts of this novel broke my heart while others angered me, but the story as a whole captivated me.  How could it not?  Richard Wright was a powerful writer, and his stories still carry powerful messages today.<br /><br />Thank you to Library America for the gifted copy of this book.",4.0,1,2021
Boiler plate tale with typically underwhelming MC,"This is so tropetastic that it really left no real impression on me.  Sure the MC starts out as an oversexed, self-indulgent jerk, but don't worry, once he accidentally saves his first girl and ends up controlling a town/castle he morphs into an oversexed caring naïve jerk who's only thought is to go for a super polyamorous marriage since he can power up his wives.<br /><br />Sure he's doing it to save the town (sort of) and to get back at those who exiled him (if he ever finds them), but its still the case where the MC has ""phenomenal cosmic power!!!!!"" [patent pending] and he quickly assembles a group of girls who are happy to fall into bed with him and his other girls.<br /><br />There was almost no character development here.  Sure some things were kept secret at the start, but I can't really think of a character who I felt achieved any real substantial growth.  Instead they all muddle through as they try to expand the village and advance their skills.<br /><br />Its not bad, but I've read this story before, and its just not exciting to me.  Not after 20 or so repetitions.<br /><br />If you love the genre, this story will please you, but I think you'll agree there are far better examples in existence.",3.0,0,2021

With the assistance of a sympathetic rookie she investigates the young officer's tragic death.<br /><br />This book was too long and talky.

A Pearl Harbor Primer with Social Commentary,"“History Smashers:  Pearl Harbor” is a great primer on the “Day that will live in infamy” in particular and World War II (WWII) in general, but someone who is familiar with the events of WWII may take issue with some points in the book.  A friend who is a grammar school teacher posted on Facebook a picture of her son reading this non-fiction graphic novel.  Since my father was on-board the USS West Virginia that fateful day, I decided to examine the book with a view to sharing and discussing it with my grandchildren and great grandchildren.<br /><br />Before focusing on the attack, Kate Messner outlines the events leading up to WWII in Europe and Asia with an emphasis on Japan.  She discusses colonialism in Asia and the Pacific as a prelude to Japan’s expansion.  Throughout the book, the author employs sidebars and graphic panels to provide social commentary on colonialism, the annexation of Hawaii by the U.S., segregation in the armed forces, my Dad’s shipmate Dorie Miller, an African American who was awarded a Navy Cross but died later in the war, brothers who died together, the role of women during the attack and the war, the environment, and other subjects.  Some of the sidebars deal with lighter subject matter such as the jitterbug contest the night before the attack and a pilot who took off in his pajamas.<br /><br />Although I have been to Hawaii many times, I did not realize until reading this book that the USS Utah was also a ship, along with the Arizona, that was not raised by the Navy and serves as a resting place for many of its crew.  The author quite rightly points out that anti-immigrant talk and hostility is as much of a problem today as then.  The internment camps were a symptom of racism in the country.  The author includes a useful timeline of WWII and Pearl Harbor.  Like many authors, she includes two excerpts from other of her books at the end.<br /><br />As an old guy who majored in history, served 30 years in the Army, and then taught high school history for 13 years, I have a few additional comments:<br /><br />• The description states that the reading level is 8-12 years.  I doubt if an eight-year-old could read this book.  Middle school might be more appropriate, but I defer to the judgment of grammar and middle school teachers.<br />• The author states that FDR’s movement of the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor “was meant as a threat.”  The move by FDR was intended to deter Japan and act as a restraining influence on further Japanese aggression in Asia.  The move did not place the fleet “so close” to Japan as the author states.  The fleet was closer but still thousands of miles away from Japan.<br />• Although the author correctly points out the numerous warning signs before the attack on Pearl Harbor, she neglects to mention that 70 years ago our government did not have an adequate system of sharing such information.  The Departments of State, War, the Army, and the Navy then were largely stovepipe organizations that did not always cooperate with each other.  In fact, they were more competitive than cooperative.  Today, it is easy for us to connect the disparate dots of information and express wonderment as to how folks then failed to see the attack coming.<br />• The author states that “Japan did give the United States a warning – just not a very long one.  Half an hour wasn’t enough time for people in Washington to do anything at all about the attack.”  Actually, the Japanese ambassador presented the warning to the Secretary of State one hour after the attack had begun.<br />• The author includes a section on the Navajo code talkers as part of the contribution Native Americans made during the war.  In the section on the flag raising on Iwo Jima, I feel she should have also included a few sentences on Ira Hayes, a Pima Native American who served in the Marines and assisted in the flag raising.<br />• The author highlights the heroic contributions of Japanese Americans in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in Europe.  I wish that she had included a few sentences on Daniel Ken Inouye who lost his right arm in combat, received the Medal of Honor, and later served as a senator from Hawaii.<br />• I question the inclusion of the section on the four-month project to train dogs to attack Japanese.  The author had already made her point about inherent racism among Americans and in the military, and I felt that this section was a bit over the top and unnecessary.<br />• A minor point.  On pages 157 and 158, “navy” should be capitalized.  Whenever talking about a specific branch of the U.S. armed forces, that service should be capitalized, i.e., the Army or the Navy.<br /><br />I recommend “History Smashers:  Pearl Harbor” to parents with middle school children and look forward to reading it with my grandchildren and great grandchildren.",5.0,1,2021
Fussy foodie nonsense.,"I bought this Kindle book with a steep discount, thank heavens. It is of British origin; the writer seems to think that it has been adapted for American use and access to ingredients. The writer is mistaken.

On the plus side, it's nicely written, with a pleasant style that almost masks the pretentious undertones of the recipes.",2.0,0,2021
"What a fun and festive followup for this series, can't wait for the next one in June","am Barnes is definitely an acquired taste as far as main characters go, but now that it's the second book, I'm finding I like her much better now than in the first book. I've always enjoyed her sense of humor though. Sam's realized she's where she belongs now and is even getting her sweet Diogi to listen better, well maybe a little better. It's hilarious how the pup responds and learns from Helene though.<br /><br />It was fun (for us readers) having her parents in town although Sam didn't seem to enjoy it much until closer to Christmas. Her mom was in her element again, and Dad was just being secretive about something. The mystery was complex and really good. I like how Sam and an old acquaintance worked on the last part of the case, and I sure didn't realize who it was until Sam said their name. The showdown was a really good one with some surprising help from someone I never would've expected to be there.<br /><br />All in all, Sam survived her first Christmas in Cape Cod. The ending was pretty hilarious since it ended on New Year's Eve which was supposed to be a nice quiet romantic evening for Jason and Sam. But this was Sam, of course it couldn't be the way she hoped things would go. I was laughing while picturing the scene and I think others will too!<br /><br />I voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC of this book provided by Berkley Publishing via NetGalley, and my opinions are my own.",5.0,1,2021

"Filled with inaccuracies, boring lists of minutiae, and EGO!","I was a fan of Fleetwood Mac back in the day, so I thought this might be an interesting read - boy was I wrong.  As noted by other reviews, the book is literally filled with inaccuracies large and small, as well as page after page of lists of minutiae - seriously, what is with this guy's fascination with what color shawl she wore for a certain song?  Who cares?!  If I would have read the words ""Very Rhiannon"" one more time I was going to scream.  Finally, the bias is truly unacceptable.  I get it, the book is about Stevie Nicks, but the hero worship is nauseating!  Everything she did was successful and everything Lindsey Buckingham did was terrible.  Right.  What put me over the top was the ego of this woman!  She's proud of sleeping with married men, tripping from bed to bed, years of drug abuse, multiple abortions, and self-indulgent behavior at every turn.  The book details how she acted like September 11th ONLY happened to her while she sat in her Presidential Suite at an expensive hotel and while I think the Ipod gifts for those at Walter Reed Medical was a nice gesture, her stating that now she was ""a wife, mother, sister"" etc. etc. to those wounded was revolting.  Rumors was a great album, it went downhill from there.  She had her moment in the 80's and is sitting with millions today because of it, but she's not the greatest musician, singer, dancer, or writer in the world and she's certainly not Mother Theresa.",1.0,0,2021

BEST BOOK ON PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN,"So far, I've read three of the four releses from last summer on the Royals, in particular, Harry and Meghan. I did not finish, ""Battle of the Brothers"", but have read ""Royals at War,"" by Dylan Howard, ""Finding Freedom"" by Omid Scobie and this selection. Actually, I've poured through all of the above several times. Lady Colin Cambell's account is the most revealing, riveting and well written.<br /><br />There are some editing problems, such as repeats of material, but hopefully these will be corrected over time. I really can't explain the levels of fascination/like/dislike/aversion so many feel towards these two individuals. However, I'm convinced that Meghan Markle is the reason for the extreme polarization in attitudes. And, as set out in Lady Campbell's very in depth narrative, you'll understand why, if you're wondering, also.<br /><br />I'm not a big follower of the Royals and I only came to know who Markle was, after seeing headlines regarding her relationship with Prince Harry. I had a pretty neutral opinion to start, but something seemed off about her, as I watched a broadcast of the engagement interview and subsequently, their wedding.<br /><br />By the time MM was pictured continuously and repeatedly fondling her expanding abdomen as her pregnancy progressed, I began to feel distaste, then actual dislike. And, yes I've had two children and never do I recall an occasion, especially in public, where I demonstrated such tacky behavior.<br /><br />And, then I discovered what Lady C's multitudinous sources had to say about the background and history of Harry's choice of spouse. This book is extremely detailed and exposes a disturbing picture of MM. I was honestly amazed at the research which had to be done to back up the portrayal, as it seems to be balanced, but overall negative in tone towards the American former actress.<br /><br />There are some startling revelations about H & M, which can only be interpreted as grim and it seems as though any chance of redemption has been lost. If you can choose only one of the four versions regarding this subject, I would definitely recommend, ""Meghan and Harry: The Real Story"" over the others. I don't think you'll be disappointed...",5.0,1,2021
A cold case investigation  that continues the saga of the ongoing characters of the Kings Lake  police procedurals.,"Smith is mentioned but does not appear.  The mystery and investigation can be enjoyed as a standalone but its worth reading the previous books in both series. They are excellent but also add the depth and growth of Christopher Waters.  It is his POV primarily although we also see things from Cara Freeman's perspective.  This book and the previous one, Roxanne, seem particularly bittersweet to me with a sensitivity towards victims that is often missing in this genre.<br />Wonderful, clean, intelligent writing.

She hasn't been there all that long and has responsibilities to the students, keeps some of the ledgers, and sort of a jack-of-all-trades. Coming from Haven House and Academy for the Enrichment of Young Women, essentially a place where female by-blows of nobility were sent to live their lives and learn a trade, there weren't many options for Chasity, so landing this job was a big deal.<br /><br />Aston Terramier is the dance and music instructor at the institution. He's got a story of his own, but he's handsome, charming, intelligent, witty, and gifted at music. He's surrounded by all of these females, both students and staff, and does his duty with professionalism and keeps it on a professional level, even when he had to dance with Chasity.<br /><br />One dance was all it took for them to fall in love.

AMAZING,"I couldn't put this book down and read it in three days.  I would have finished it in even less time but I had to stop reading long enough to carry on my life.<br /><br />This was an absolutely excellent historical novel about a divorce trial and later a witch trial in 1663 Boston.  It is the story of how women were treated and looked upon by men and what happened to a spirited woman with a strong personality and the courage to speak on her own behalf. It is a book about abuse, which some readers may find disturbing, and about a woman, in early New England, who said NO MORE.<br /><br />The characters were real, likable, three dimensional and almost walked off the page.  I cared deeply about Mary and was cheering her on as she tried to save herself from her husband, Thomas, and attempted to make a life for herself.<br /><br />I would give this book more than 5 stars if that was possible and highly recommend it.",5.0,1,2021

Can we just stop?,"So here we are again with a teenage virgin and a ""hero"" more than twice her age. I do wonder what these authors think about their readers. Do they realize we are not teenagers? Or virgins? So yeah, this story is about a child of 19 who somehow manages to get a marketing internship at a company in NYC that bears absolutely no resemblance to NYC. The hero is rich because they all have to be billionaires now. The ""Daddy"" and ""little girl"" meet in a bar, lose each other, and find each other a couple times. These are just distractions. This short book is really about two annoying people and their sexcapades.<br />Just to clarify, I love smut. I'm not judgy about someone's kinks. But, really? Why are we going to these extremes these days? This is not sexy to me at all. It's not even what a Daddy Dom would do to his ""little girl."" He puts a belt around her neck and chokes her. He shoves his dirty thing down her throat. He ""destroys her cervix."" There's no aftercare. This is just gross rough sex.

This is not one of them. I'd really like to encourage erotic romance writers to resist this trend of rough nasty sex.

Achieve Peace,"3 1/2 Stars<br /><br />""The Mystics Gift KK Johnston is a book with great ideas to center in one’s life. The six areas are incredibly important and are even a bit of common sense.<br /><br />The problem that I had is he uses a theological approach called gnosticism.  This says that the core of the information is a secret and only those with special access will get the real information.<br /><br />Coming from the Judo/Christian perspective, this concept was determined to be a Hersey hundreds of years ago. Why? Because almost all religions believe that God reaches out to people to help and to heal.<br /><br />Additionally he should written clearer by going into a nonfiction explanation, rather than using the writing style of a novel.<br /><br />In summary, it was a very good book.<br /><br />Recommend with reservations",3.0,0,2021

and now for something completely different,"If you told me that I'd read a book that made the main character a rabbit living in a dungeon as said rabbit slowly evolves into something more than just a dumb prey animal, and that I'd find that story interesting...  Honestly, I think I would have died laughing.  The idea is just so outlandish.<br /><br />In this case the story somehow works.  Yes, the story is written as if the reader can look into the mind of said rabbit and listen in on the stream of consciousness thoughts of the rabbit.  Which of course is extremely repetitive at times, and often goes off on asides.  Yet, that only gives this tale some charm.<br /><br />its not long.  Its not complex.  There really isn't a community of characters.  And the plot seems to be a bit of an afterbirth.  But this story manages to entertain simply because it has a strange idea and does manage to draw the reader in.  You want to know what will happen to said dungeon bunny.  Will she survive.  What will she learn?  And where will she go?<br /><br />This story doesn't manage to answer all those questions, but it manages to charm as it explores all the possibilities.<br /><br />Very solid tale.",4.0,1,2021
"Not the author’s fault, but faulty formatting ruined the novel!","I really look forward to new works by Daniel Silva, but this Kindle edition was a real let down.  My copy jumps forward multiple chapters when turning the page at the end of some chapters.

Finding myself lost in the plot line, I’ve gone back to close to the beginning to try and follow the story.  If I can’t make it work, I will be requesting a refund.

Cliffy-mafia/society-innocent h- possessive H,"I skimmed a lot of this book especially during the beginning and it also ends in a cliffhanger and I don’t think I’ll continue even though I did love Adrian.<br /><br />Things:<br />-The H: Adrian is a mafia guy (not traditional it’s got a secret society take) he is JP which I love (not a lot of jealous moments but lots of possessiveness). He has a ruthless rep but he’s soooooo frickin sweet and adores Val.<br />-Care taking: Adrian is so sweet to Val. He carries her a lot and bathes her, Feeds her, puts her in his lap. Washes her hair. I really loved this.<br />-H is protective and possessive in the best way! “No one else will touch you.” “If I see you with another man, I’ll kill him”. Her protection fails and he almost kills his best friend bc he was her security the night she was almost hurt.<br />-The h: she’s a “mafia” princess or a secret society princess and she’s been arranged to marry a disgusting man who beats her. She’s innocent and meek but she’s tougher than she seems bc she keeps surviving through all the BS.<br />-arranged marriage: ok the h is arranged to someone else in the beginning. These 2 are each other and it’s kinda instant but the h goes to the H to ask him to kill her fiancé.

"The most stereotypical, implausible, and stupid book I've read in a long time","There are so many things wrong with this book that it is difficult to know where to begin.  In terms of the characters, we have three deeply flawed friends who solve life's challenges through lies, criminal actions, and childish conduct.<br /><br />The story centers around a sick friend who sends her former college roommates on a mission to retrieve her dog from her ex-husband.  Rather than simply asking for the dog back, the ""hilarious"" antics undertaken include grand larceny (stealing a van), illegal drug usage, destruction of private property (wrecking a convenience store with a baseball bat), etc.<br /><br />Each antic is preceded by unlikely or even stupid behavior.  Who takes a kitten to a convenience store restroom?  Who leaves their purse and cell phone in a car with a person that they just met, then wonder why the car -- and their belongings -- have disappeared?<br /><br />The ""fun"" character is a has-been actress who joins the duo on their quest to retrieve the dog.  The actress initiates much of the illegal and stupid activity -- flirting and lying to get her way, taking drugs, stealing, destroying private property -- and engages in cliché behavior -- visiting a shaman, reading their auras, etc.  Her character is completely undeveloped.  We know nothing about her, her background, or why she has even joined the other two on their quest.  She is cardboard.<br /><br />In terms of romance, the author again falls back on clichés.  The sick friend is divorced from an unhappy marriage, and pines for the child she will never have.  The main character is widowed from an unhappy marriage, and hopes to start a relationship with a married man.  Yes, he says he is going to get a divorce -- don't they all?  The third friend is gay, and has the only happy relationship.  We never learn about the actress and her marital status, but what we do read is that she flirts and lies to get what she wants.  Is the author trying to say that it is impossible to have a happy relationship with a man?<br /><br />In keeping with the author's premise that all men are bad, the male characters in the story have no appeal.  There is the married doctor who is trying to initiate a relationship with the main character, the ex-husband and the dead husband who are both painted as cold and uncaring, the trucker who wants a blow-job and is willing to take a kitten to get it (not sure how that works as a threat in real-life), and a convenience store owner/clerk who hides from confrontation rather than calling the police.  (As to the convenience store clerk, he simply had to say ""folks, the police are on their way and everything you are doing is being recorded on the store cameras"", but no.  He hides behind the counter instead.)  There is one normal guy in the story -- the vet --but of course the main character has no interest in him.  She wants the married doctor instead.<br /><br />If this was a story about three teenagers, we'd roll our eyes and move on.  The fact that it is a story about three grown women makes it just plain stupid.<br /><br />Save your money and buy a good book instead of this one.",1.0,0,2021
Wonderful read.,"The story is very much isekai, but in the best way. The character isn't some OP monster who disregards danger and wins with pathetic ease.<br /><br />Rin makes the story great with his character development being stable and actually believable if a bit faster paced, but books don't have the luxury web novels do. The harem aspect isn't pushed and makes for some fun character interaction.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's too short ( I averagely read 1k books in a day) and the next one isn't out yet.

One of the two authors of RISE AND FALL OF DODO tries unsuccessfully for a sequel,"I loved Neal Stephenson's and Nicole Galland's THE RISE AND FALL OF DODO. It had everything that Stephenson's best work has; a solid scientific foundation, an interesting plot, a drily humorous and irreverential sendup of Government and bureaucracy and witty banter.  The sequel has, sorry to say, few or none of these qualities.<br /><br />THE MASTER OF THE REVELS is a true sequel to DODO in that it picks up right where DODO ends (which is a but inconclusive). All the same characters are back (a few new main characters are added as well) and the story is basically the same: former ally 1600s London era witch Gráinne (we learn that the name is actually pronounced ""Gron-ya"" - who knew?) has taken over DODO, bewitched Blevins, and unbeknownst to all but our erstwhile heroes (Tristan, Melisande, Erszebet, Rebecca and Frank Oda plus a few newbies) who have defected from DODO, is out to undo the advancements in science and technology that led to the absolute end of magic in1851.<br /><br />Most of the novel takes place in the present, and in two different DTAPS - Shakespearean London in 1606 CE,  1397 CE Florence and 309 CE Sicily.  These are interesting and more than a little cool as expected of Galland who is well- known for her previous historical fiction. The descriptions and antics of William Shakespeare, his brother Ned, and Edmund Tilney, the eponymous Master of the Revels are fun, as are the early first and second millennium Roman bits.<br /><br />The writing is certainly more than passable, but is clearly different from that in the original DODO, and not in a good way.  Much of the humor  and dry, biting sarcasm is gone, leaving a time travel adventure that, aside from the historical fiction of the three different eras listed above, is simply more of the same as DODO,  just not as good.<br /><br />MASTER OF THE REVELS is still worth a read despite my critical review (which I predict will be in the minority), especially if you've read THE RISE AND FALL OF DODO, but I rate it as a solid 3 stars.<br /><br />JM Tepper",3.0,0,2021

Like a friend walking with you in difficult times,"This book is like a friend who walks with you in difficult seasons. Lina's honesty is so refreshing and down to earth, yet hopeful. My favorite quote from the book is, ""God's goodness is meant to be received in the midst of our pain not proven by the absence of our pain."" Lina has proven that someone can come through excruciating times of pain and loss and still find purpose, meaning, joy, and hope. And yet, Lina never claims to have ""arrived."" Longing and loneliness are still part of her life, but she steers the reader to God who ultimately satisfies the deepest longings of our hearts. (Cliché as that may sound, it's true.)

"A ""Tour de force"" Modern Romance by One of the Best!","T L Swan always puts the delicious in  ""Alphalicious"".  She writes the best heros with prodigious physical attributes, dirty minds and mouths, and aggravating ,albeit entertaining, flaws. The dirty in the sex scenes is pitch perfectly balanced with swoony romance.  Her heroines are feisty and multi-dimensional.  However, she really exceeded her own high bar for great romance with this book.<br />I devoured this book like the yummy feast of reading happiness it is. You know that great feeling when you are enjoying every minute of the book? You're happy the story is resolving but you want more...you don't want the story to end?

Really Awful ... Spoilers Within,"I just read through this book, and now I'm pissed off.<br /><br />I feel that I wasted my time with this thing. The beginning was pretty good. It drew me in. And then the middle portion of the book started fading a bit, and the last third was an utter piece of crap. The ending, one of the worst I've experienced in a long time.<br /><br />So annoyed am I with this book that I feel the need to rant a bit on some of the major plot points that made absolutely no sense. So, without further ado...<br /><br />-SPOILERS BELOW-<br /><br />First and foremost, the middle and latter parts of the book hinge on Barry having been sent back in time... But wait! We never learn how Slade identified Barry, why he chose to send him back. Nothing. An act of kindness? Seems unlikely. How did he know about Meghan? Did some super-super quick research when Barry showed up in Long Island? The whole thing reeks of deus ex machina, and while I'm willing to forgive a little bit of that here and there, this is a major plot element! Ugh.<br /><br />Next, Vince shows up in Barry's past, saying he's already been there for three years. This seemed reasonable at that point in the book, but wait! Later in the book we discover, in Helena's multiple trips back in time, that basically one person is in control of the timeline at any given point. (Well, as I understand the rules -- which seemed to change depending on the page and what happened to be convenient at that point in the plot.) So, if during Helena's long trip back, none of the many countries in possession of a chair as of just before her trip were able to send someone back to find or interfere with her, then how the hell was Slade able to send Vince right back into Barry's timeline? This is a major inconsistency and strikes me as incredibly lazy writing.<br /><br />Next, Barry's romance with Helena. They bond, so amazingly, so instantaneously, over ... Um? Huevos rancheros? Nothing at all?<br /><br />Next up, the entire sequence where they're repeating the same 29-year loop or whatever it was. And every single time, Helena has to go back and re-meet Barry and blah, blah, blah. But why? Was I the only one who kept waiting for them to figure out that hey, maybe they can take turns, and only go back 15 years each time, or something like that, so they don't lose all progress on each iteration? This would clearly work within the rules of time travel stated in the book, but no, instead we as readers have to suffer, just as the characters do, through this artificial suffering that never had to happen.<br /><br />And finally. The finale. Slade to Barry (paraphrasing): ""You'll have to go back to the original timeline, and it will be the most difficult thing you've ever done."" Helena, in her many trips back, never seemed to get there. (Why?) But Barry, after overdosing on narcotics and whiskey, simply wanders into the lab, and - boom - gets it on his first shot! Hell yeah! World saved, story over, they all lived happily ever after. Because that's a really great ending, right? No. (Never mind the fact that he's in NYC having lunch, and next thing we know it's the next day, he's on the opposite coast, has tracked down his guy, has broken into his house, found his gun, set up a whole thing ... Come on.)<br /><br />Well, I feel somewhat better now. If you're here too, thanks for reading. And may you find something better to read in the future. Or if you have a memory chair, kindly go back to before I bought this book and break my Kindle in two.",1.0,0,2021
"Another partial story stretched out via a series of ""books""","No spoiler with review. This is a partial book with a cliff-hanger ending. A mysterious $167,699 check enabling exact payment of her student loan is received by the female protagonist. After paying her loan, Olive accepts a mysterious invitation and a ""First-Class"" ticket to Maui, Hawaii.  Is she actually free of debt? That concept is the actual start of the story, and could have been produced within a few paragraphs, instead of stretched out artificially. At one point Olive starts to read a book by one of her favorite authors, who just happens to be Charlotte Byrd. Not only does this author blatantly gives herself a pat on the back via her female protagonist, but also has the character refer to scenes in one of her books. Had this been done with more subtlety it might have been effective, but instead comes across as self-serving, jarring, and juvenile.<br /><br />Tell Me to Stop has grammatical errors, and little depth, although it does include a couple of interesting events. Overall, this is just part of a story that is artificially divided so that income can be derived from each of the subsequent parts. This is certainly less difficult than filling those additional pages with character development and story development.  This segmented style is a disservice to the readers who purchase books from writers who withhold most of the story.  A book, as with a story, should be complete; consisting of a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Many of the partial books/parts of a series have dialogue and scenes that are stretched, sometimes almost endlessly, in order to obtain sufficient pages in which to encompass each book part. I often wonder if many of the authors who publish series digitally even possess the creative skills necessary for development of complete stories, and of characters with complexity.  Certainly, producing a partial book allows the writer to kick the can down the road when it comes to providing details needed for a conclusion.<br /><br />Tell Me to Stop did not provide enough to encourage this reader to want to pursue the additional parts.  It suffers the similar condition of many such partial/series “books”; that of projecting as stretched and shallow. As more writers artificially divide their one story into multiple, so-called  “books”, I find myself turning back to paperbacks, because those paperbacks have complete stories, and hence are more worth the cost. When purchasing digital books, I actively search for authors who, within their books, provide that for which I am paying; a complete story.<br /><br />4 stars for story potential, 2 stars for author execution, averaged into a score of 3 stars",3.0,0,2021

Good for understanding the small bits of weather,"This is a fascinating book. I check the weather forecasts frequently but the nearest weather service is over sixty miles away. I live in the rain shadow of mountains and at the east end of a strait bounded by mountains on the north and south. My weather is frequently very different than that forecasted for the general area.<br /><br />This book helped me understand microclimates and the weather produced in small areas. I learned how weather condition differ because of land characteristics. I now know why it is often raining at my cousin's house but not mine when we are only a few miles apart. I have learned how to listen to the wind, noticing the changes in sound as it changes direction and intensity. I understand now why there is frost on the shed roof when my outside thermometer registers an above freezing temperature. I know what the red and green on apples mean. I know why fir trees are better to be under during a rainstorm than broad leaf trees.<br /><br />My favorite section was on rain. I do live in the Pacific Northwest and we get our fair share of rain. I had no idea rain had different tastes and smells. I learned about the variety in the size of raindrops and the speed at which they fall. Now I listen to the rain, noting its various sounds.<br /><br />This book contains a wealth of information for readers who want to know more about their weather and what causes it. Gooley has a fun writing style, frequently adding personal stories to illustrate his weather revelations.

The Jeffery Epstein saga reimagined as a thriller,"This thriller is an alternate look at what could have happened if Jeffery Epstein had lived and leveraged his blackmail to shake the pillars of American business and political power. The book clearly uses real life as the template on which to build a rather outlandish assassination thriller. So what happens if Epstein (played as Shrader in this book) had an automatic system to make public all of the compromising “child rape” videos involving moguls, politicians and “deep state” actors in the event he did not remain free, alive and well? What kind of storm would be unleashed as the titans of power either scramble to control or destroy the kompromat? The chaos kind. This story is told through alternating first person views where whoever is advancing the plot gets a chapter no matter how minor their character is in the overall story. So there is no true main character but instead we have an eclectic group of “operators”, family members, and mid level government employees who are thrust into the chaos to save their own lives or the lives of loved ones. The characters are likable enough to keep you reading and there are some great moments of thrilling action like the showdown in the park. But it begins to fall flat because what is portrayed as a near omnipotent adversary (the “deep state” aka CIA director Lisa Rispel clearly based in part on real world counterpart Gina Haspel) can’t do anything right. There is supposedly this existential threat but our band of heroes mows through enemies  with all the effort of throwing logs through a wood chipper. This book could have taken a cue from GRR Martin and had some reason for the reader to fear that loss might be even remotely possible. The writing was for the most part well done. There were needlessly difficult words littered throughout, as if someone revised this thing while sitting by a thesaurus. Like one of the words I had to look up (inculpate) was listed as only having an “archaic” definition in my kindle dictionary. But despite that, the writing is anything but amateurish. It tells a decently enjoyable story. Where there are gaffs (like the CIA being a big bad enemy on American soil…they are restricted from running ops within US borders) they are common to the genre. I did find it amusing that this group of badasses all carry guns in the small of their backs, which is commonly regarded as the worst way to carry (slowest reaction time, no ability to protect the gun, risk of spinal injury from a fall, no better concealment than other more advantageous positions).<br /><br />I would read other stories in this series but they wouldn’t be my first choice. Enjoyable but not compelling and had moments where it was dragging and I just had to put the book down. You could do worse but you could also do better.",3.0,0,2021
"I like Danielle, just not this book","I follow Danielle on social media and appreciate a lot of her recipes. I, too, have an autoimmune disease, so I don't write this review to pick on her at all.<br /><br />The writing is almost teen-like; maybe this book would do well in a Young Adult section. To be clear, and to be honest--I couldn't finish it. Although she has been through a lot, I just didn't see any real depth in her writing. I didn't feel her sharing anything more than she's shared on social media. Her writing felt more like a book report than a personal story.<br /><br />It was also hard for me with all of the religious talk. I'm fine with a mention once or twice, but this book had too much for me. This is just a side note for anyone else that might not like a lot of that in their reading.<br /><br />Memoirs are not easy to write, so I give her credit for wanting to share her story. I just feel it was lacking.<br /><br />I've seen negative reviews that get on her for saying that ""food saved her"", when she's taking meds for her condition. I think food saved her by being able to figure out tasty meals for a disease that doesn't allow any of that gooey processed good stuff she grew up on. And yes, there is a correlation between inflammation and diet--no matter what some doctors want to say. So give her a break. I think those reviewers took the title a little too literally.<br /><br />Overall, I can't say I recommend this book. Her cookbooks, yes. But not her memoir.

Mediocre at Best,"SPOILERS: I normally really relish a Ward book, because there will be a good solid romance, unfortunately in this book not so much. I never felt Leo and Felicity connect during their summer romance or their reconnecting. I thought the characters Sig’s romance with Brittany told to Felicity during the story was more powerful. The fact that Leo is married when Felicity and him reconnect ended up killing the book for me. I understand that nothing physical takes place until after he separates from his wife, but the marriage being so easily disposable to Leo left a sour taste in my mouth. Especially since up until Felicity showed up on Leo’s doorstep he had a marriage, and didn’t afterwards.<br />The audio book was brilliantly done, but the story fell flat for me as a reader.

"A wild & wonderful road trip novel with relatable, endearing women-- & a lovable Pyrenees dog rescue","I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I related so strongly to Samantha, the protagonist. Now, that could be because I also have a Great Pyrenees (see photo!), I’m divorced, and my daughter is getting ready to head off to college — probably on the other side of the country. I think it's more likely due to the fact that Ann Garvin has this superpower to write about relatable women. Her characters are messing up, trying the best they can, and they are all lovable in their own way. Oh how I adored this book! It's just the right mix of sad and funny — like life. And the ending...wow. There are a lot of life lessons tucked in this book. Read it!",5.0,1,2021
Author had an attack of liberal PC derangement syndrome,"Had to quit this book.  It’s the last in the series and...unfortunately...the author went full politics.  In all the past books the author usually avoided any PC politics references.  Not necessarily blaming current, real world ideologies.  This final book was quite different.  Right from the start the author does an about face on past books and blames nationalists for putting money/economy over climate change problems...which is the current liberal claim based on misinformation.  The book’s President is obviously supposed to be a Tump-like character...using mannerisms and language that is perpetuated by constant media, socialist and liberal exaggerations.  Since I see no end to this lunacy I’m shoving this last book aside.  It’s too bad...author must be suffering from liberal PC derangement syndrome.  This is not my thing.",1.0,0,2021
"bad physics, shallow characters, weak space opera","This is what happens when an author has no understanding of elementary astrophysics.  The book is filled with cases where the author naively thought spacecraft would behave like airplanes in atmosphere.  He's used to concepts that only apply when there's air resistance, and an external gravity field.  For example, a vertical loop in an airplane is faster than a horizontal one, because it has wings that act against the air, but in space there's no difference.  He has objects sliding around during a vertical loop that didn't during a horizontal one (despite no external gravity field, and the ship having artificial gravity), or just foolish mistakes like acceleration being expressed in meters per second (instead of meters per second per second).  The resulting action just sounds rediculous.<br /><br />The characters are shallow caricatures. The heroine is a ""mary sue""; overpowered, can do no wrong, and absurdly lucky.  The evil humans are evil in every way, all the time, and completely unsympathetic.  The reader is never even tempted to root for them.  The evil aliens, Tullizor, are not developed at all.  There are no Tullizor characters, and no view of events from their perspective.<br /><br />There are a few grammar errors, but not too many.<br /><br />I finished this first book, but have no interest in reading any sequels.",3.0,0,2021
Not for me,"This book was a disappointment.<br /><br />There were two gross sex scenes before I had time to even bond with the main character. The author has a character use the Lord's name in vain about 20% through the novel (and then it occurs again and again throughout).<br /><br />Much of the story appears to take place during the depression, and the author gives great detail about the effects of the depression on the animal life. It's difficult to read, and not something I would've chosen on my own. If I hadn't been reading this book for a book club, I would've stopped before I was 3% into it.<br /><br />The author also uses her work to make a left-leaning political statement glorifying socialism/communism.

A page-turning coming of age story with just enough tech and terrible aliens,"Sentenced to War by J.N. Chaney and Jonathan P. Brazee is a page-turning coming of age story that I made the mistake of starting at 10pm. When I got to the last page at 3am, I immediately checked to see if the next book was available. The next TWO are available, glory be. (It doesn’t end on a cliffhanger, it’s just that good.)<br /><br />I love military scifi and coming of age stories, and found Sentenced to War a good mix of the two. Our main character, hopped up on hormones, gets himself sentenced to a stint in the military as a conscript. Humanity is at war with technologically advanced aliens. It isn’t going well, and we need more cannon fodder, which is why even a traffic ticket gets you drafted for a term of service.<br /><br />Aspects of this story reminded me favorably of Old Man’s War by John Scalzi, and Orphanage by Robert Buettner. While it does follow a “formula” in which our character goes through boot camp, training, battles, etc, it never becomes formulaic. I had no idea what was going to happen next, and there was never a TSTL moment.<br /><br />I like Rev Pelletier, our main character, who is a believable product of his culture and upbringing. He’s got good bones, as they say, if only he can grow up before he gets blown up.<br /><br />I’m not former military, and I don’t care about tables of organization, rank, proper military speak, and so on.  I’m also happy to assume that in the far future, when humanity has spread out to multiple new planets with hundreds of billions of us floating around in multiple military organizations, that rank and structure will have changed. So I ignored the reviewers who railed against those things.<br /><br />The technology was explained well enough I got the idea without ever descending to complete geek-speak and trumping character. At its heart, Sentenced to War is about a good guy learning how to make tough decisions and finding the place he belongs.",5.0,1,2021

Not All Fairy Tales Are Nice,"As someone who was never a fan of Cinderella - save for the Brandy version which to me is the only one that matters - I was actually excited to read this different and rather dark retelling featuring a rebellious Black girl and a f/f romance.<br /><br />Bayron has turned the fluffy Cinderella myth into a dark, dystopian society that dictates a young woman and her family literally put themselves into debt to ensure they attend the ball looking their best, in order to basically be bartered, if not chosen by the prince (who is way worse than a toad). As a reader we're made to investigate just how such a benign fairy tale becomes a cultural touchstone and how dangerous it can be. Sophie is on a quest to change a world that demands she submit and fit.<br /><br />I have to laugh with a certain eye-rolling derision at the detractors who complain this story isn't ""original enough"" or ""I wanted something else"". Let me be quite clear - had Sophie been the typical girl protagonist, these critics would have loved the book and excused its ""derivativeness"" because they often do. Unfortunately many of these readers demand stories told by/and or about BIPoC meet some unfair threshold (or contain sufficient trauma/suffering) that non-BIPoC books do not.<br /><br />Let's be real - YA is chock filled with plots that have been done to death and that's okay. I'm on BookBub and the number of ""special teen girl with superpowers meets mysterious hawt boy du jour"" books available is staggering to say the least. It's how an author breathes new life into a story or includes characters who give readers a different perspective that can take cherished tropes and make them new.<br /><br />Seriously, a queer Black Cinderella who doesn't want to be the princess? How many times have we seen that? Who fights with another young girl against all odds?<br /><br />Precisely.<br /><br />Sophie is the kind of brave heroine I wish I had growing up. I wish I had a Cinderella tale that wasn't silly, frilly, and made me feel that I had to wait to be chosen by a man. This is a book for all the queer Black girls who never see themselves as princesses or who get happy endings. It's also for girls of any hue who want to be more than society dictates.",5.0,1,2021

"Not what I expected, but full of useful information","I have been writing most of my life and specialize in covering combat sports (primarily Boxing). While I have been published both in online and print publications through the years, I have struggled to consistently earn for my work, despite devoting my life to it.<br /><br />Although I am a Boxing lifer as I like to tell people, several experiences through the years ranging from not getting paid for my work, (Consistently have been told that getting exposure is more valuable than money by people I have done work for), and having content I own stolen from me for a period of time, soured me on doing freelance work. For the last several years, I've been running my own outlet, and while I do enjoy it, earning money still remains a struggle for me even after a lifetime of writing.<br /><br />As I am looking to potentially re-enter the freelance realm periodically while I continue running my own thing, I picked up this book. I will freely admit that I am somewhat ignorant when it comes to SEO content and seeing as I am also lacking knowledge about freelance job boards (Something I was unaware of when I started as a kid in the mid-90's), I was hoping this book could point me in the right direction so at least there is a possibility that if I did work for an outside outlet again, that I wouldn't be fed that dreaded line about the benefits of ""Exposure"" versus the ability to earn a consistent income from my work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author does not explore the topic of freelance job boards and how not to be scammed by clients, but she does an excellent job of explaining the various elements of SEO content and keywords, which I will hopefully be able to put to use with the content I create for my outlet. She also goes into detail about some of the various writing tools and software that are available, some of which I did not know about. I was trained long ago on Microsoft Word so that's been the software I have used virtually my entire career, but I did appreciate the information on the programs Google in particular offers.<br /><br />I had relatives years ago telling me how they enjoyed Google Docs for their school assignments, but I never tried it citing my being trained on MS Word as my reason. I have tried different programs in the past, in particular a program called word perfect, but it just didn't have the ease of use or the compatibility requirements when I would send material off to editors that would make switching from MS Word viable.<br /><br />In any case, I enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it for anyone that wants to learn about SEO content and content marketing.",4.0,1,2021

Another Excellent Mystery,"This is another excellent mystery by my favorite contemporary mystery authors. She writes mysteries that fit the cozy mystery category in that they can be read by people who dislike gratuitous sex and violence, or by preteen readers with good vocabulary. But the plots and characters have much more depth than some cozy mysteries. So you have the best of both worlds, elaborate, tightly plotted mysteries that will not offend even easily offended readers. I am only moderately easily offended, but some of my friends and family have much higher standards and I would not have any problems recommending this book to any of them.<br /><br />And her plots rival the plots of many of the all time great mystery writers. The results when they are revealed at the end clearly fit the clues that have been provided throughout the story, but the results are not obvious enough for me to guess them in advance. I often reread books by this author just so that I can see how she provided enough clues for the ending to be believable without having me guess the whole answer or even most of the answer, although I occasionally guess a few small parts of the answer, which I enjoy doing.<br /><br />So if you enjoy Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, G. K. Chesterton, Earle Stanley Gardner, and other great mystery writers, and want a change of pace from short, simple, ""cozy"" mysteries, but are not a fan of ""horror"", this is one of the best current authors that avoid both extremes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a lot of horror books that have nothing else going for them, which do not interest me at all, unlike well written books that have some elements of horror.<br /><br />Fortunately there are lots of cozy mysteries and some of them are well written and interesting, and I have given many of them four stars and a few of them five stars, but it is really hard to write a shorter mystery extremely well, so I am delighted every time Dianne Harman releases a new mystery. I know that I am about to read an in depth novel with an intriguing story that involves a mystery that meets my high standards.",5.0,1,2021

Exactly!,"Having spent some extended time in both China and Japan, I used to take downtime and weekends to deep dive into what the heck is it that makes these cultures so distinctly 'other' than each other and incomprehensibly different than American physicist business guy. The author has spent most of his life living and thinking on the matter. His lifetime observations add to my own vignettes are kind of breakthrough ""Aha!"" moment.<br /><br />Most striking for me was Conrad's cumulative grasp of the core differences. The author delivers striking background and precise metaphors.<br /><br />I agree that it's a matter of belief systems surrounding time. We are steeped in Western tradition that 'Infinity' linear, it started, it is now, and progresses toward an incomprehensible big number. The West is saturated with cultural anchors of unique past, present, and TBD future toward the end of days. There is no similar word expression in the Eastern languages to convey a concept of linear time. Western mores, concepts of good vs evil are an ancestral inheritance inherited from the past. The Bible studied might consider that only things where that we didn't inherit divine guidance relate to electrodynamics, the Standard Model implications, and bio-engineering. 3000 years ago, these would have no meaning to record. Xtianity, Islam, most Western paganism include and end of days. The West inherits fixed and unchanging Truths.<br /><br />Time is circular in the East. Buddhism, Shintoism, most Confucianism, Daoism, operate at the moment. But, that's too simplistic for the Western mind in commerce. Linear time has no philosophical meaning in Eastern culture. Time never began. Never ends. Time repeats in a circle. All that is, was. Truth is relative and relative to the circular nature of time. The implications, as Conrad elucidates are profound. Relative 'Truth' worldview changes perceptions of everything and permeates life. An Eastern ""Yes"" is not what Westerns understand.<br /><br />Japan and China are wholly different cultures with dramatically different mindsets. The author explores the matter in stunning vignettes and detail.<br /><br />This is the very best primer and intro to what to expect in dealing with the two countries that I've chanced to read. Here are some critical hacks to get beyond the very real and literally inexpressible cultural tight spots. It's a book to read ... and then re-read chapter by chapter.

This didn't go where I expected it to--but not in a good way.,"""Dog Logic"" opened promisingly enough for me to want to go on, with an off-kilter but low-key charming description of how copper bullet fragments deep in his brain allow Hertell Daggett to ""remember"" the sights, sounds, and especially smells of bygone ages, still stored in the monkey, dog, reptile, and amoeba ""brains"" underneath the layer of homo sapiens on top.<br /><br />The well-written descriptions of Hertell's days at the Lil' Pal Heaven Pet Cemetery, his interactions with various visitors/mourners, and his kind-if-vague personality kept my interest reasonably well--and when the enigmatic, empathetic, and musically inclined Mr. Frostie came on the scene, things got more interesting.<br /><br />I was all set for a leisurely journey to finding out what really happened to put those fragments in Hertell's head (Was it 4th of July or New Year's? Did his dad cause the accident?), and whether their effects were real (this is a science-fiction book, after all) or not, and what the effects of that would be. A couple of chapters in, I realized that we were in ""Regarding Henry"" territory, with hints that pre-bullet Hertell was a self-centered, arrogant, cold genius who abruptly informed his wife that he'd ""met someone"" at a conference in Brazil and wasn't coming home. Which he clearly did, so maybe the story would dive into the difference between the well-meaning guy I'd been reading about and the jerk he used to be.<br /><br />Then the voices and accordion playing turned out to be real, not just echoes of ancient memories, and suddenly it was ""Blast from the Past,"" but with the surface-dwelling Hertel in the Brendan Frasier role. OK, that can be fun, too....<br /><br />Except it wasn't. I never found out what happened to Hertell, or whether the prehistoric memories meant anything, or even how a community being locked away underground for 50 years adapted (or didn't) to modern life. Instead, the book took a turn into--well, ""satire"" implies a wit and lightness of touch that just doesn't apply here. Instead, the author went into full contempt mode, imagining how the Government (every agency from the FBI to the FDA) decided to squash the time-refugee community like unruly bugs, and taking swipes at everything from Presidential vulgarities to lawyerly shenanigans to law-enforcement ego bruising to the way over-educated young blondes ""Talk in up-speak? Like all the time?""<br /><br />At that point, it wasn't charming anymore, and it wasn't interesting, either. Or, as much as these kinds of tales have to be, plausible. Don't invoke the power of the Internet trolls to smuggle illicit information out from behind government firewalls but ignore the ability of that same information to generate outrage both online and in person. Don't hand-wave into being a basement-mechanic build-able device that provides unlimited, clean, free nuclear energy whose only by-product is pure gold--and then not bother to even mention the impact that would have on society, economy, etc.<br /><br />I do appreciate the sad but optimistic chapter relating Mr. Frostie's life and death from his point of view--that could make quite a good short story on its own, with a bit more development. But the end, the book felt more like a half-constructed chain of ideas that could've used a lot more fleshing out--or the seeds of a couple of good short stories buried in a pile of ""people these days--ugh"" sludge. Which is too bad, because I started off liking it a lot more than I did at the end.",2.0,0,2021
Good character development,"Kit, nearing middle age, changes her name and moves to a dumpy little house in a dying town in Connecticut. She gets a job at a library and vegetates. Something has happened to jar her, to wound her, in her previous life. She works and keeps to herself until a strange teenager shows up to do community service. Sunny is nearly feral, having been raised by a dad and mother who are on the run from something. Her guileless and happy attitude begins to work on Kit. The third oddball in this story is Rusty, a former investment banker who lost his job and is in Riverton pursuing a forgotten bank account that will fund his return to the normal world. He thinks. As these three become allies (Kit is too wary to have friends), we see in flashbacks the trauma that so damaged Kit, and it's pretty significant.<br /><br />This is a story of Kit's learning to trust and care for humankind again. And for herself. The trauma she described is horrific, and the growth and recovery slow but satisfying. Sunny and Rusty are interesting characters, as are The Four, a group of retired men who have coffee and read the paper every morning.

A bit of ick,"I'm going to start with a disclaimer that this will probably only matter to you if you're involved in kink and/or are queer. I fall into both categories (I'm a sub and bi, so you know where I'm coming from), which is really what made this book a miss for me.<br />Let's start with the queer representation. I like that Liam, Bodie's best friend, is bisexual ... but it's really seemingly only used for an explosive homophobic moment. And then we've got an unflattering line from Bodie's perspective where she basically says it's a shame that he's bi because otherwise she'd marry him. Don't love that, and I feel like it just adds to the bi-phobia and misrepresentation we face.<br />Then there's the kink aspect. You might not notice or care if you're not actually involved in kink, but the way that Braun handles Bodie is.. suspect. She clearly has a broad range of triggers stemming from lifelong abuse, some of which he knows encompasses physical abuse. Still, he treats their encounters after their relationship shift with no respect for where she's coming from. With what he knows about her and her past, it's abusive. I thought about stopping at the scene where he orchestrates her ""capture"" (hard pass on that scene, which is at best, dub con) but decided to see how it moved on. I called it quits, however, when Braun decides that the best way to introduce Bodie to sub life is to strip her down and make her perform in public. For their first outing. Yucky yucky, no thank you.<br />The writing is good and the characters were interesting, particularly Bodie - it just wasn't enough to overshadow the icky feeling the MMC was giving me.",2.0,0,2021

As this novel opens Maggie and Laurent leave Maggie's family and beloved Atlanta behind to return to France.  Laurent has inherited a small estate in Provence so he and a reluctant Maggie have decided to go to there to inspect the property and decide what to do with it, a process Laurent expects to take a year.<br /><br />Laurent takes to their new life in the tiny village quite happily, but Maggie is at loose ends and is counting the days until their return Atlanta.  When the pair meet some other Americans who live nearby Maggie is thrilled, and Laurent hopeful that this will make Maggie more content.  Maggie becomes friends with one of the women, who does help Maggie settle into village life.  This promising beginning is shattered when one of the new circle of friends is murdered at a party celebrating the first grape harvest from Laurent's vineyard.<br /><br />This series has a great deal of promise and does make for an enjoyable read.  Unfortunately the author has seemed to go for quantity rather than quality - she produces a couple books a year in this series, and has five others as well.  This rush to publish might be responsible for some annoying continuity errors - characters change heights, eye color etc at random, illogical plot developments - characters over look obvious actions to do rather absurd things.

Three Stars for Me,"I normally love Joanna Shupe novels, but this particular book fell flat for me.

Within less than 24 hours Harrison has contacted his former mistress in France that he’ll be returning shortly, picking up where they left off. This is why it’s a three star book. Shupe for me as a reader broke the cardinal rule of romance. Once the hero professes his love, which Harrison did, no other woman, even in a pique, are ever to be looked at, and especially not contacted to resume a relationship. Harrison supposedly had been in love with Maddie since he was 15. Instead of trying to fix his marriage by possibly wooing her, he decides to go back to Paris and take up with his mistress.

"Cool World, Zero Chill in the Writing","I have incredibly mixed feelings about this novel, hence the three star rating. I do seem to be in the minority, with this book averaging 5-stars so far, so this might just be the picky in me coming out.<br /><br />What I Loved:<br /><br />- Iron Widow has an incredibly cool and pretty unique world building and magic system, though its more technology than magic. Kinda both, kinda neither. Basically there are pilots of gigantic transforming robots, inspired by classical mythology. Most of these ""Chrysalis"" robots have a male and a female pilot, but the female typically dies. This isn't a rule, as there are ""balanced pairs"" where both survive.<br />- Our MC, Zetian, is determined and a hard worker, both basic components needed for a sci-fi/fantasy bad ass.<br /><br />What I Didn't Care For:<br /><br />- This book touts itself as a feminist novel and my god is that an accurate description. I like books with political and social messages, but I find the best of these weave their ideas through the text in a way that feels immersive but subtle. This book smacks you in the face with them. It definitely decreased my enjoyment of the piece to get bludgeoned with this message, even if its a message I agree with.<br />- The info dumps. Good lord, the info dumps. The world of this book is expansive, so I understand the need for exposition to let the reader know what's up. Unfortunately, those clarifying details are provided in large explainer passages that completely pulled me out of the story multiple times.",3.0,0,2021

Loss — the great redefiner of life. ~ Terri Guillemets,"“Mistress of Rosings Park” begins with a very different relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  The great lady is being evicted from her home a year after the death of her daughter and Elizabeth has a great deal of empathy for her as her situation is not so very different from Mrs. Bennet’s likely eventual fate when Mr. Collins evicts her.<br /><br />Fitzwilliam Darcy had married Anne de Bourgh and been widowed shortly thereafter.  He now wants Lady Catherine to move to the dower house or the London house — her choice.  Elizabeth is at Hunsford to visit Charlotte Collins who is suffering symptoms of pregnancy.  When his wife cannot aid his patroness, Mr. Collins volunteers Elizabeth in her stead.  Elizabeth moves into Rosings.<br /><br />Charm is a woman's strength just as strength is a man's charm. ~ Havelock Ellis<br /><br />Due to his marriage and bereavement, Darcy had not gone to Meryton and thus had met none of the Bennets.  Elizabeth must let her courage rise to meet the man she feels is cruelly evicting an old woman.  She must also deal with various visitors who endeavor to meet the new widower.  After all, he must be in want of another wife.  The visitors include two women already known to Elizabeth:  the Bingley sisters.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  She placed a purposeful smile upon her lips. “Perhaps you would allow me to give you the acquaintance of Lady Pinkston, Lady Arrowood, and Miss Arrowood.”<br />Lady Arrowood intoned in her most quailing voice, “You will not make my daughter nor my mother nor me known to a mere ‘miss’ who thinks it proper to call upon an unmarried man.

Well not what I expected from Jay Allan,I want someone to verify that Jay Allan wrote this book.  I have been a BIG fan of Mr. Allan's for years and have a hard time believing this is his work.  Something just doesn't jibe with Mr. Allan's previous style of writing and action oriented sci-fi.<br /><br />Also it was news to me that the marines started to let their men go on leave with their weapons in tow and live ammo - I mean what could possibly go wrong.  The marine's in this book must be issuing really old M-16's that go full auto during a fire fight (many marines say they get hand me downs so I guess this could happen).  Caught a couple of times when Travis's name changed to Tyler and Lucas to Lance which was confusing but since I didn't care about the characters I just pushed on.<br /><br />I have read worse but not from an established writer that I enjoy.  If there is a second book in this series I will probably pass on it which is a shame.  I really hope that Mr. Allan spends his limited time on something else rather than to keep working on this series.,2.0,0,2021

It is easy to get a thousand prescriptions but hard to get one single remedy.  ~ Chinese Proverb,"Anne’s problems with the medical profession begin in the first days of her life.  She is a fussy baby with a controlling mother who finds a medicine man able to stop the baby’s fusses.  Opium — better than a hundred pacifiers for maintaining quiet in Rosings Park.<br /><br />But, the quiet does not exist within Anne’s head.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  The voices of all the grown persons in my life buzzed inside my head like the whirring of insect wings, reminding me gently that I was not meant for such darting quickness.<br /><br />Thou hast the keys of Paradise, oh, just, subtle, and mighty opium!  ~ Thomas De Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, Part II<br /><br />Anne’s nurse is at the center of her early life:  the caretaker, the teacher, the giver of drops.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  When the weather was fine, and the sun not too strong, Nurse sometimes took me out to the garden, where, if it was too early for my first dose, I practiced reading from the Book of Common Prayer, my tongue stumbling over sentences no more comprehensible than the whispering of the wind through the trees, and far less interesting.<br /><br />The reader lives inside Anne’s head through much of the book.  This author is truly a wordsmith, especially with her descriptions of Anne’s sorrow.  Here is a sample:<br /><br />I stood staring at it, the seed abruptly putting out strangling vines inside of me, which wrapped around my heart, squeezing until I thought it might burst.<br /><br />It took all my usual disquiet and smoothed it away like the tide over the sand. It made me willing to speak of things I’d never spoken of before—my nighttime visitors; the anger that rose in me with frightening strength when I thought about my mother.<br /><br />I did not answer, and we sat silently for a moment. I breathed openmouthed into my palms; I could feel my breath, warm and moist, and smell it, faintly sour with fear. The only sound in the room was the rain on the windows, an infernal, endless drumming that put me in mind of Mamma’s fingers on the arm of her chair when she was irritated.<br /><br />What is straight? A line can be straight, or a street, but the human heart, oh, no, it's curved like a road through mountains. ~ Tennessee Williams, A Streetcar Named Desire, 1947<br /><br />At long last, Anne finds love!  Anne’s life has not been ordinary and neither is the one she loves.  Anne examines her relationships with various women in her life:  her nurse, her childhood governess, and her cousins’ wives.  She finally understands why women have been more valued in her life than men.  Her path to a happy ending takes as many turns as any other heroine but she arrives.<br /><br />Scenes of Anne’s life are described in detail — except for some events her mother would consider significant.  For Anne, the news that her cousin has refused to marry her is practically a non-event.  And when Anne makes her break for freedom, we learn of it only after it has happened.<br /><br />I particularly liked the ending chapter — beautifully done.<br /><br />The important thing is not the object of love, but the emotion itself. ~ Gore Vidal",5.0,1,2021
The Cave Bears Will Get You Before You Make It To The Exit,"I truly hate to give a low rating to a book that contains biblically sound advice. The problem with “Out of the Cave” is that it takes forever to deliver it. This book is acceptable (if sluggish) if you want to stay out of the cave of depression. But if you are already “in the cave,” I fear most readers will give up long before they reach the hidden chest far, far in the back where the real treasure is locked away.<br /><br />The author uses the example of Elijah to demonstrate that you shouldn’t feel bad about yourself if you are experiencing depression. It’s something that happens to dedicated Christians, even to pastors, even to a prophet of God in the Bible — and it only means that you’re human. Unfortunately, this is almost the ENTIRE FIRST HALF of the book. And you haven’t even received any helpful advice yet, either.<br /><br />It would be unfair to the author to entirely summarize the rest of his book. But to give you a bit more of the biblically sound counsel that is (eventually) provided, you must have a relationship with God. He gives you your identity — not comparing your life to your friends on Facebook — and He felt you were worth sending His son to die for you! And He will help you look up (at the spiritual matters that last) rather than around (at the temporary world and situations around you). You also need to find your purpose — the meaningful work God wants you to do in this life. And of course you need Christian friends — people that will spiritually encourage and support you. Also, you are not alone in your struggle: Among other causes, in 2020 and 2021 record-breaking numbers of individuals struggling with the isolation, uncertainty, and other stresses of COVID-19 have also found themselves unexpectedly experiencing depression.<br /><br />This represents a summary of a significant portion of this entire book. There is some sound content here, but it should have been delivered in a booklet a fourth the size. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this is my first foray into this topic and I don’t have a better recommendation. If you feel you are sliding toward the cave entrance, this book provides what you need to stay out of it — with a fair amount of sifting through the chaff to get to the real wheat.  If you are already “in the cave” of depression, then I recommend that you search for something on the Christian bookshelf that is well-rated and much shorter.",2.0,0,2021

Really Disappointed - Trigger warning should be added (Domestic Abuse),"KA is one of my favorite authors. I literally one click buy anything of hers as soon it comes up for sale. But I was so disappointed in this book and it's the first time I felt that way in one of her books. I almost stopped in the middle because it had all the markings of an abusive relationship, which I really think needs a huge trigger warning - especially since none of her other books are like that. Maybe that's on me - but I expect characters in her books to be likeable, kind, softies at heart. But this did not feel like that.<br />Buck literally threw her into a wall. She had multiple bruises from his grip and how hard she hit the wall. And that got brushed under the rug and everyone just moved on like nothing happened. Then there were scenes where she wanted to leave  and he physically prevented her from leaving; once he told her he owned her and she needed to get in the truck and she just did because she felt like she didn't have a choice. He was verbally abusive on several occasions. She had no where to go, no money, no one to rely on and was in danger; it felt like an abuse of power, abusive type relationship.<br /><br />I liked the branching out and having a MC from foster care and the struggles they can go through in life. But it really felt like that was just a token backstory meant to justify her being in this abusive relationship. Honestly, this story made me feel really uncomfortable with the domestic violence situation.  I wouldn't recommend it and I won't be re-reading it like I have for all the other KA series.",2.0,0,2021

Encouraging & Informative Book,"I chose to give this book a 5 rating because of the sound Biblical approach to dealing with toxic sons & daughters in laws.  The advice wrapped with scripture caused me to quickly change my attitude and approach to my son's fiance.  I was shocked to see how the advice with scripture changed my heart so quickly and totally.  So many extended family members see the toxicity in her and I may need to purchase a hard copy to share with them to help them know how to deal with this new in-law I am about to have join my family.  Up to now  everyone has gone out of their way in the past 2+ years  to be kind and make her feel welcome but two months from wedding time, she has said she doesn't like any of the (25)+ of our  family.  We are a not perfect; but tight knit Christian family and many are afraid she will isolate my son from the extended family he loves so much.  God has completely replaced my hurt and angry feelings with an attitude of love and acceptance.  She is a Christian and I believe someday God will break through her heart and maybe we can be friends.  I had a wonderful relationship with my mother-in-law that only grew better as the years went by.  Even with a 32 year difference in age, we were good friends.  I hope and pray that someday God will change my future daughter-in-law's heart.

Jamie Ian John Jemmy Claire?,"Dana we love Jamie John Ian Jemmy and Claire and Brianna.<br /><br />Was so looking forward to getting to know Jemmy and read about more of his antics.  Positively loved him. He almost didn’t exist ;(<br /><br />Excited to read about what Brianna would invent.  The author just left out everything that I was looking forward to reading about what this character would create.  I wondered if she would invent modern plumbing, a rifle, something, anything, but NO.  NOTHING.  Such a letdown.<br /><br />While I appreciate the thought to develop other characters I found myself uninterested  with Silvia et. al. (exception Ian’s rescue scene).  Mandy - leave her out and I would not miss her at all. Amaranthus I had hoped would move to England and out of the novels. Appalled she’s William’s match in any way. At least William wasn’t as much of a whiner in this one. His character was too petulant to be anything more than annoying. Lord John, we missed you dearly too.  Love Hal’s acerbic wit.<br /><br />I hate to admit it but it surely does seem like your focus was on the TV series not the characters we have grown to love i.e. Claire standing on the third floor - such a copycat scene from Titanic. :(<br /><br />Ian’s new pup received less than honorable mention as well. Would have been 100x more interesting than Mandy + Amaranthus (seriously she’s awful).<br /><br />As much as I love your writing - I really do - I did not enjoy the vast amount of time spent on all of the extraneous and less than interesting characters in this one.<br /><br />Please bring back the characters we love. And for the sake of all of us let William grow up or remove him. In comparison to Ian, William is a total letdown. The fact that Jamie focuses so much energy on William, an ungrateful, spoiled, and rather useless son and so little on Ian - his true son by blood and bond is a shame.  Yes. I know he’s his nephew. But it’s Ian who is always there for him and literally gave up his life at one point for Jamie.<br /><br />Seems like the author sold out almost completely on this book to Hollywood.

It's........ok,"I was intrigued to read about a 'corpse whisper' and I thought the story was entertaining. A problem I had with the book was how the MC kept talking in her head, but it was almost like a second personality. It annoyed me that the MC kept calling the voice in her head the Brain Bitch or Head Hag....The second I saw that the paragraph started with ""Little Allie"" I skipped it and moved on to the next paragraph.

I like fun romances but the sex in Score's books is a bit extreme for me. But this one really crosses a line as far as I'm concerned because of the violent aspect of it. No, I'm not a prude.  I just think romance books should be fun and the sex scenes in this book made me cringe. Hopefully that's not a spoiler alert. But it made me wonder whether kids can download this book.

Deserves a sequel.,Often when you read LitRPG there are these grand overarching stories that are going to take volumes and volumes to tell the tale of. Not this one. This was intensely relatable as it kept the goal in sight and was about someone trying to pay a mortgage. This is not the sexy world redefining hazards. He won't die if he can't do it. It felt more personal and relevant because of that. For all of that I think it deserves more expansion. Also pineapple is an entirely legitimate pizza topping just like anchovies.,4.0,1,2021
"Cute idea, but the characters needed a lot of attention","My regular complaints about the ""Harem"" LitRPG genre are fairly consistent.  I find that the majority of these books end up with cardboard cutout characters and a plot that lacks depth.<br /><br />And that's what I saw with Lunar Alpha.  While there is some attempt to give at least one of the female characters a bit of depth, overall they were nothing more than paper thin tropes used to offer the main character a place to insert Tab P.<br /><br />And the rest of the tale suffered for it.  We don't get to know the villains motivation, which might have worked, if they weren't so completely faceless.  Worse, the girls who the MC is saving are so argumentative and contrary that I had a hard time wanting to see him save them.  It was just hard to accept their attitudes.<br /><br />But as a juvenile fantasy where a titular loser and D student suddenly gets to hold multiple beautiful women in his arms while he simultaneously saves them from complete annihilation despite his lack of intelligence, experience and guts... well, this book will definitely please you.<br /><br />I'd like to hold my fantasy characters to a bit higher standard, so I can't give this a high score.  it does earn my standard 3 star rating.  Its not bad, but honestly, I can't see going out of my way to recommend it either.",3.0,0,2021

I failed to find surprising insights,"The book's first half is a basic introduction to AI where the authors repeat the well-known examples of the AI’s success story (for example, deep mind reduced Google’s expenses on air-conditioning by 40%). The second half includes discussions regarding possible scenarios about the influence of AI.  Since the authors are three VIPs, I expected to find many surprising insights. Unfortunately, I failed to find any.<br /><br />The book also suffers from some minor mistakes. For example, in the first part, the authors claim that Descartes's famous statement “I think; therefore I am” was meant to point out the importance of thinking to our lives. Not so. The statement attempted to deduce existence by using thinking (like the deduction in mathematics). Another example: the author claim that machine learning algorithms do not explain their prediction. This is true for most algorithms, but there are some exceptions: each prediction is fully explained when issuing predictions on the basis of association rules (if-then rules).",3.0,0,2021
This clears a few things up,"This is the 9th Maggie Newberry cozy mystery.  There is a very strong overall story arc to this series, so much so that this book will be almost incomprehensible unless at least most of the earlier books have been read.<br /><br />The small village where Maggie and Laurent live is tiny, only a couple of hundred people live in and around St Buvard so it is very important that everyone get along.  Unfortunately the long time residents have a difficult time adjusting to the few Americans there, particularly to one - Maggie Newberry.  Lately though another American family has arrived that just might make Maggie seem better by comparison.  A chef and restauranteur, her husband and daughter have purchased the long closed bakery, done extensive renovations to open it into a bistro...directly across the street from the town's only restaurant.  As if this is not enough the woman is quite rude, not just to the villagers but also rude to her own family causing scenes in public.  This state of affairs, coupled with Maggie's own latest faux pas, has set the town on edge.  When a murder occurs the whole town is in an uproar and yet there is still more trouble to follow.<br /><br />This is a charming series, but one that has been plagued with careless writing and sloppy editing causing numerous errors in continuity and character development.  In this installment though, some of the apparent inconsistencies have been addressed and, for the most part, the characters are behaving at least a bit, more logically.

Unsolved Murder on The Outer Banks of NC,"In the summer of 1967, Brenda Joyce Holland,  a young woman working with costumes at the famous outdoor symphonic drama, ""The Lost Colony,"" was murdered just shy of her 20th birthday. The news shocked the small idyllic town of Manteo.  Although I have been following ""The Lost Colony"" since the 1980s and have lived in nearby Nags Head since 2000,  I had heard almost nothing about this tragedy.<br /><br />Journalist John Railey has done an exhaustive review of all the interviews, newspaper clippings, suspects, potential witnesses or accomplices, and local chatter to write ""The Lost Colony Murder on the Outer Banks: Seeking Justice for Brenda Joyce Holland.""  Although I didn't move to this area until 33 years after the event, I was well acquainted with the names of many of the people who were interviewed and/or their relatives.

Then we go onto another dozen killers, till Jeff shows back up again in 1978 on page 254 for two & a half pages. Then onto more killers till page 341, when Jeff shows up again in 1987, for 36 pages. This time he details his crimes & how people taste during his courtroom trials.<br />I'd much rather have had a full chapter about each killer, neatly put together, than to read a bit about them, then not hear from them again for 100 pages & seven other killers later.<br />I read it, but I didn't enjoy it too much, it was WAY too disjointed.",2.0,0,2021
"Oversimplifications galore, but a good checklist of habit formation techniques","Despite some obvious oversimplification and somewhat fundamentally flawed analogies, McKeown provides a good checklist of behaviors or habits that may reduce chances of a burn-out while pursuing one's goals.  As with earlier work, the cartoonish representations of ideas sometimes fall flat and silly, but the ideas are worth exploring.<br /><br />In three sections, ideas on intent, execution and habit formation are presented. The pithy discussions draw from various disciplines but superficial; a more curious reader could use some key terms from behavioral psychology to hunt for a nuanced and detailed understanding.  The narrative tone is mostly conversational and cheerleading..  Perhaps, the best part of the book is the well curated and presented summary and actionable ideas presented in each of the three parts; and in a combined manner towards the end of the book.  Starting from that summary tables may be the best way to read the book.<br /><br />Overall, a good source of ideas.  3.5*<br />(Review based on ARC from NetGalley)",3.0,0,2021

"Definitely ""Historical"" Plus ""Fiction""","Tracey Enerson Wood combines the best of fact and fiction in her novel, ""The Engineer's Wife.""  It is the astounding story of the woman behind the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, an engineering marvel of its time.  Emily Warren Roebling was the wife of Washington Roebling, who vowed to complete the project after his father, John Roebling, who designed the bridge, died of tetanus following a ferry accident.  Washington himself becomes disabled after suffering from ""caisson"" disease, which I have always heard referred to as ""the bends,"" which he acquired from his frequent visits to (and too rapid exits from) a compressed air chamber deep below the waters of the East River in New York. Emily helps Washington fulfill his promise by becoming a courier of his instructions from their home to the worksite.  Woods's portrayal of the inequalities for women in the workplace and even fashion are quite rich.  Emily is the subject of much derision for venturing into a ""man's world.""  Indeed, Emily might have been quite the suffragette  if not for the fact that acting as her husband's proxy took all of her time.<br /><br />All historical fiction books throw in made-up characters, but Woods really pushes the limits by inventing a romance between Emily and P.T. Barnum, the famous circus showman,  who actually worked in Brooklyn at the same time, but of whom there is no evidence at all of a relationship with Emily.  Having said that, those portions were some of my favorite parts of the book, particularly because I am so unversed in the logistics of engineering.  Woods did her best to ""dumb it down"" for novices like me, but I still found myself at a loss for understanding exactly how the foundations for suspension bridges are built underwater.<br /><br />Woods brings the post Civil War time period to life by weaving in the politics, corruptions, scandals, social mores, and the complicated familial relationships of Emily and Washington.

Will I even bother reading more of Daniel's books?  Where are these high reviews coming from when Nothing Happens? Daniel lists many names of readers at the end of his books.  Maybe people like seeing their names in print and give a 5 star review.  I liked Book 1; Liked book 1 of the Luck series too; and read the other series he wrote - which I can't think of right now.  So maybe I read Daniel's books because I do find things to like, but I'm getting close to giving him up OR only reading his Book 1s.  More story/plot, less eating and harem building, and silly blushes.",2.0,0,2021

An exceptionally well written time travel book!,"I’m a huge fan of Tracy Higley, having read all of her books in the 7 Wonders of the World series.  When I found out that her new series was about time travel, my curiosity piqued as I’m a fan of time travel movies and TV shows.<br /><br />Within the first few pages of A Time to Seek, I was hooked.  The protagonist, Sahara Aldridge, is an English woman around the age of 30 who is an Egyptologist.  Her passion for digging into the sands of time in Egypt in the early 1920s was left to her from her deceased parents, also Egyptologists.  Clues begin surfacing from Eve, a long-time friend, that cause Sahara to wonder about her parents (who never returned home after a trip to Italy 15 years earlier).  What really happened to them?  At the same time an American reporter, Jack Moretti, enters into her life asking to do a piece on her, take photos of the dig, etc.  But Sarah feels there is more to his request.  Can she trust him?  What are his motives?<br /><br />With this backdrop, Tracy entwines the reader’s mind with twists and turns as you read about Sahara’s quest to find out the truth about her parents and Jack.  Of course, since the book is about time traveling, the reader is zapped back in history to meet interesting heads of state in Ancient Egypt, all the while Sahara is doing her best to gather information, survive and return to her modern day.  Since this is book 1 of 3, I was left with no answers to the big questions and pining for more of the story.<br /><br />A Time To Seek made me feel I was in Egypt.  Tracy captures the sights, sounds and smells of Egypt of the 1920s and ancient past.  Oh, to be a fly on the wall and time travel back to see the Pharoahs of old (and hope to not be swatted before returning to modern day).<br /><br />I struggled to put the book down at night so I could get enough sleep for the next day.  It’s just THAT good!  I highly recommend this book.  I am very anxious for the next book in this series .",5.0,1,2021
Good read,"Birdie's husband has disappeared. After a search, it seems he's absconded with his employer's funds, disappearing with a girlfriend. Birdie's an alcoholic, and this pushes her over the edge. When her best friend Max helps her dry out, Birdie must then deal with her very angry young adult daughter.<br /><br />After college, Hannah is pregnant, won't tell the father, and is determined to start a new life on the west coast, as far away from her mother as possible. Hannah blames Birdie for the breakup, depriving Hannah of the loving relationship she had with her dad.<br /><br />This story is about both women moving on. It's fast-moving, if rough. Both women go from even-tempered to hysterical too fast, and Hannah's college roommates and ""friends"" turn hostile on a dime, without reason, so it's a little uneven. Also, the promising setting (Palmetto Island) doesn't play a big enough part. Still, it was an enjoyable read with a satisfying ending and enough remaining loose ends to pull you into the next in the series.",3.0,0,2021
"Unpopular opinion, I'm sure!","I thought the plot, the story line and relationships were intriguing. But, I perceived the dialogue as being stunted and too treacly for the most part. There also was no subtlety to the narrative, i.e. points were not only made but reiterated and, I felt, the reader clobbered over the head with them.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I believe that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a good book written poorly.",3.0,0,2021
"Aliens turn Earth into a video game, one man seems to be self-aware.

Of course he also has a great ""class"" with all sorts of special advantages as long as he is aware enough to use them.<br /><br />But while the main character does end up feeling OP, and the other human characters had me wondering when they all received their full frontal lobotomy; I found myself wanting to cheer for the main character.  he was endearing in an unusual way and a lot of fun to watch his occasional flailing around.<br /><br />Beyond that this is rather more boiler plate than well thought out and slowly building plot.  However, I definitely am still happy to have tried this tale.  So I give it a low 4 star.  It should have ended better, and the side characters felt very flat at times, but overall this is a solid effort.",4.0,1,2021
"Terrific, G-rated, contemporary romance","For the past two years, Zoey has been Gavin’s assistant and protégé in a marketing company, and the whole time, she has done her best to tamp down and conceal her highly unprofessional, intense, romantic attraction toward her infinitely desirable boss. Gavin is single, wealthy, and gorgeous, and as far as 23-year-old Zoey knows, he not only has no girlfriend, he almost never goes out on a date. Unfortunately, because he is her boss and, worse, is 20 years older than her at age 43, any possibility of romance between them is doomed from the start. On the plus side, Zoey has been completely successful at hiding her feelings for Gavin behind a blank, unemotional mask. But that hard-won achievement has earned her the snide nickname around the office as, the “robot.”<br /><br />Zoey has been contemplating for weeks turning in her resignation to escape the increasingly painful pangs of an unrequited adoration for Gavin that refuses to starve to death. Until the day that Gavin’s 60-something secretary gets terribly ill with a horrible flu, which induces temporary delirium due to a high fever, and Zoey and Gavin simultaneously show up at the woman’s house to check on her. A few days after that, Gavin comes down with the same devastating flu and, while in the midst of his own fevered delirium, desperately texts Zoey to come and help him. While nursing him back to health, the former, power-imbalance dynamic of their relationship flips on its head and, suddenly, a romantic connection, once so utterly impossible, careens into the realm of eminently plausible.<br /><br />I’m actually someone who has always purposely avoided romance novels with huge age differences. Prior to reading this novel, I had previously read only a handful of them during decades of romance reading. Even the late, great Georgette Heyer could not fully win me over in the several books she wrote with an 18-year age difference between a 17-year-old, naïve heroine and a world-weary, 35-year-old, noble hero. But in spite of that personal prejudice, because I had just read and greatly enjoyed the first book in this cute, G-rated, contemporary romance series, I leaped into reading this book. And I am so glad I took a chance on it.<br /><br />Zoey and Gavin are highly sympathetic characters whom I liked very much, both individually and as a couple. There are also a whole lot of wonderful, vividly drawn subcharacters in this book, most notably Gavin’s fantastic parents, whom I adored. In addition, the classic, “secret baby” trope so beloved in the romance genre is included in this novel with a compellingly unique twist—the secret baby does not belong to the heroine. It is a well done subplot that skillfully forwards the romance. It also frequently brought tears to my eyes, which is a remarkable feat in and of itself, considering what an extremely jaded romance reader I am.<br /><br />It is a challenging task for G-rated romance novelists to plausibly create a modern relationship between attractive, compelling protagonists, who have strong sexual chemistry but never make love, when religious conviction prohibiting “fornication” plays no part in the situation—which it does not in this book. But though there are no more than a few kisses in this whole book, because of the adroit way that this talented author has constructed the plot, it definitely made sense to me that these characters did not have sex before arriving at a the classic, committed, romance-novel HEA.<br /><br />All in all, I raced through this book, reading every word, which is an uncommon occurrence for me these days, and I am currently eagerly jumping into reading Book 3 in this delightful series, after devouring this book and Book 1.<br /><br />I rate this book as follows:<br /><br />Heroine: 5 stars<br />Hero: 5 stars<br />Subcharacters: 5 stars<br />Romance Plot: 5 stars<br />Secret Baby Plot: 5 stars<br />Writing: 5 stars<br />Overall: 5 stars",5.0,1,2021
Very interesting,"This book is very wordy and long winded like most others from that era.  It discusses unusual science and some philosophy that makes you think.  The most interesting part is about the trip to and inside the cave.  Oddly enough this cave is believed to be located in my home county in Kentucky and I’m pretty sure I located it.  There are many geographic landmarks mentioned that I can identify and others believe they have located it too.  That alone is fascinating but then you wonder at what point is this book true (since the cave trip details are so accurate) and which are fiction (there’s lots of strange and unbelievable but not impossible things that happen in the cave).  Overall, interesting and mysterious story.  It was popular in its heyday and worth reading today.",5.0,1,2021
Great advice even if you disagree with the premise,"The premise of this book is that the United States is headed for imminent fiscal collapse followed by utter chaos.  Therefore you should prepare now if you haven't already.  The author goes into detail about what currencies to invest in to maximize your financial assets when the US dollar is no longer viable.  He covers livings off-grid and having food and water stored for long-term use.  In fact, he lists in a 42 point checklist everything you need to do to prepare for the coming disaster.  The book is well researched and contains links to reference materials and websites.  The book could have been doom and gloom, but the information is presented in a helpful and hopeful tone.",4.0,1,2021

"Good book, but I don't agree with it.","I enjoyed reading the accounts of Martha, Lazarus, Simon and Mary. They were short stories I thought maybe the book could've been better if the stories were combined. But it is still a pretty good book.<br />The part I definitely don't agree with is Mary of Bethany being combined with Mary Magdalene. I did a lot of research after this book, which is why it has taken me so very long to review after reading. I did read all of the passages in the book from the Bible at the end of the book as well as more in depth in the Bible itself. I also did some extensive research into the 2 Mary's in the book All the Women of the Bible by Herbert Lockheart and others. Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene were in my opinion 2 totally different people in my opinion as well as the opinion of many other scholars (that of which I am not). However, for this book I guess it works, its the authors opinion to combine the 2 women, and also his freedom to do so. I don't think that freedom should've been taken, but it's his book not mine.<br />Its a pretty good read but I wish the 2 Mary's would've been left separate like they are in Biblical accounts.",3.0,0,2021

sweet clean romance,"I enjoyed this story overall. I liked both of the main characters and even the ""bad guy"" trying to stir up trouble wasn't really a bad human. And I think my favorite part was when his pined for love told him his faults to his face. I loved that he saw his problem through her words and made changes in himself and his life. Anyway, they aren't the main characters but it was an interesting side plot.<br /><br />Back to Lily and Jack. I had some frustration with them. I like that they both had failings they needed to overcome but was frustrated with the lack of communication that would have helped them along in that. Therefore, I blame Jack. So frustrated when we could read his thoughts but he was totally silent toward Lily. I think I'd have been far more harsh with him than she ever was. SAY SOMETHING! Don't just walk away. Grrrr. One doesn't have to be a big talker to communicate. Obviously his love language is service but she didn't understand that and he did nothing to help her get it. Just a simple, ""I did it because I care"" would have sufficed.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed the book overall but think that it dragged a bit with some repetition of their laments. I loved the Jack saw her as the ideal woman while other people overlooked her. I was amused when he can't see why someone would choose anyone over her. That part was sweet. Now if he would just tell her.<br /><br />No sex, language or violence",4.0,1,2021
"OK read that I enjoyed, but just a few negative comments.","I really liked Piper from the start of the book. However, and since I’m an old white guy it may sound wrong, but please accept this the way I meant it. Piper is, intelligent, independent, smart, focused and making life work for herself, sort of.<br />And then she meets Aiden, and after roughly 1/2 the book, in my opinion, she loses focus for her life and the hormones kick in and all of a sudden her life revolves around Aiden. However his life seems to revolve around himself. And to me, Casey’s editor let her get lost. And as a writer Casey really needed to focus on where Piper started, not to where she evolved to. I will admit if Casey did what I suggested the story wouldn’t be the same. It may have been better or it may have been worse. It definitely would have been different. I just get so tired of young women with so much going for them throw it up in the air for HEA, and sex.<br />Anyway I did enjoy the story, even the mystery part of it.

Hated the heroine,"Holy crap, is this heroine really supposed to be an actual functioning adult? Are we sure she’s not a 13 year old? I’ve never seen such an immature main character, and I definitely couldn’t root for her in any way. She pulls god awful pranks (giving someone glue instead of sunscreen is NOT funny), pulls everyone into her schemes no matter that they don’t want to be involved, and refuses to communicate, even with those that are supposedly important to her. She ends up realizing she’s selfish finally, but instead of growing, she becomes a self-destructive mess that just continues to hurt those around her. I finally stopped reading when she basically sabotages her relationship for no reason. In my head, I’m picturing Romeo moving on and finding someone who is actually worth his time and effort. Loved him, but it’s a DNF for me for the absolutely worthless Stella.",2.0,0,2021
"Our destiny hides among our free choices, disguised as the free-est of all. ~ Robert Brault","The original “Twist of Fate” is a creation of the not-so-very-good Reverend Collins and the not-so-very-good George Wickham.  Collins physically attacks Elizabeth Bennet when she refuses his proposal.  She escapes outdoors without her winter-wear and begins a journey to Meryton to speak to her father.  Weather is fated to be against her and she is met on the road by Mr. Darcy.  She eventually must accept Darcy’s help to her Aunt Phillips in Meryton where they are seen by Wickham and a maid who is currently his doxy.  Rumors spread through the village.<br /><br />A wedding is quickly accomplished, spoiled by an overheard conversation.  The marriage begins on a very bad footing.<br /><br />I loved a scene at Pemberley when Darcy returns after an absence of several days.<br /><br />Quote from the book: … the door opened and she made her entrance. And what an entrance it was. Darcy’s jaw dropped – literally – as he stared. She had chosen to give more than a little indication that she knew she was a married woman. Her beautiful hair was now covered with a matron’s cap – the most elaborate concoction that could ever be imagined. A starched, double-tiered structure of muslin and lace adorned with a profusion of ruffles which, he could scarce doubt, evinced her mother’s taste, or rather lack thereof. Moreover, he was absolutely certain that the highly conspicuous item had been deliberately chosen in order to make a point – and the look she cast him, along with her arched brow, only served to add the unnecessary confirmation.<br /><br />That's life — whichever way you turn, fate sticks out its foot to trip you. ~ Martin Goldsmith & Martin Mooney<br /><br />Fate Twists for other characters as well:  Jane’s and Lydia’s stories end very differently.  I loved both outcomes.<br /><br />SPOILER:  My only criticism concerns the odious Collins.  I would have liked some comeuppance.  In the words of the immortal Maud, (yes, I know, my age is showing), “God will get you for that.”  I am sure God did eventually get Mr. Collins for his treatment of Elizabeth but perhaps his Bishop could have got to him sooner.  Removal from the ranks of clergymen was in order.<br /><br />Elizabeth is proactive in solving the marital issues. She moves the couple on the way to HEA much more than Darcy, although that man does acknowledge the damage caused by his actions and resolves to improve the relationship.<br /><br />Joana Starnes’ books never disappoint me.  5 Stars for this one!<br /><br />Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous. ~ Charlotte Clemensen Taylor",5.0,1,2021

End of the line for me.,"I don’t care that the author wrote Ilium & Aodhan into a homosexual relationship. Quite frankly, I saw it coming a mile away.<br />What I cannot tolerate is when an author drags out a storyline and/or series, thus showing a lack of respect for the loyalty readers have shown and their time. (Some of us remember the agony that was Archangel’s Prophecy.)<br />Due to the fact that the reader is 80% of the way into the book before the lukewarm and shallow evolution of Ilium & Aodhan’s relationship, that leads me to believe:<br />a) This was only Part 1 of the development of their relationship and Singh is going to milk this for another book or three.<br />b) Singh just wrote this direction because fans requested it, but it was not how she originally planned Ilium & Aodhan. (I have seen this plot development suggested on forums.)<br />c) Singh has lost interest in the series and is just writing to fulfill a requirement before ending it.<br /><br />My anticipation for this story was high, but the book was such a disappointment that I didn’t even read the last chapter and I am finished with the series.",1.0,0,2021

Five Stars Plus!  Kilgallen was So Much More Than A Game Show Panelist!,"As a kid, I loved to watch the glamorous women and dashing men of the popular game show, ""What's My Line?""  Regular panelists included Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, and Bennett Cerf.  The moderator was John Charles Daly. They were joined each week by a fourth celebrity panelist.  The object of the show was for the panel to guess the occupation of the contestants by asking a series of questions that could be answered by either yes or no.  Each show featured three contestants, one of which would be a celebrity (for whom the panel wore masks and the famous person disguised his/her voice).<br /><br />What the preteen me knew of Dorothy Kilgallen was that she was beautiful, wore luxurious clothes, asked very smart questions, and she was a TV star.  I never knew she was a weekly newspaper columnist (even though they introduced her as such; it never sunk into my young brain) or especially that she was a top-notch investigative reporter. At the height of her fame, she was covering infamous trials such as the case of Dr. Sam Sheppard, who was convicted of murdering his wife.  Ms. Kilgallen wrote an article saying the guilty verdict was a miscarriage of justice.  Years later, she played a role in Dr. Sheppard's exoneration. I recall having heard as a teenager that Ms. Kilgallen had died at the age of 59.  The media attributed her passing to a fatal combination of alcohol and drugs, much like the sad death of Marilyn Monroe. I was despondent that Ms. Kilgallen had died and was disappointed that I would not see the clever woman on the game show again.<br /><br />Since I did not know she was an investigative reporter, I didn't realize until I read this book, ""The Reporter Who Knew Too Much,"" by Mark Shaw, that Dorothy Kilgallen was investigating the assassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. Kilgallen rejected the Warren Commission's and J. Edgar Hoover's theory that Oswald acted alone.  She particularly didn't buy the story that Jack Ruby could single-handedly manage to get himself into position to shoot one of the most heavily-guarded prisoners of the 20th Century. She had information indicating Ruby knew Oswald and that Ruby had contacted a mob-friendly lawyer for representation BEFORE JFK was shot. Kilgallen had revealed to confidantes that she was close to breaking the story that the assassination and murder were mob hits.<br /><br />Mark Shaw builds a convincing case that Kilgallen herself was murdered in a mob hit by someone she trusted who had access to her.  The death scene made no sense, the autopsy was sloppily conducted, her time of death was misreported, her toxicology report did not tell a complete story, and there was mob influence at the medical examiner's office.  This book enthralled me because it told me so much I never knew about (and some I wish I didn't) Ms. Kilgallen, but also, because even as a kid, I didn't believe that Jack Ruby wasn't being paid to silence Oswald so he couldn't reveal any potential co-conspirators.  Shaw links RFK, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, Oswald, Ruby, and Kilgallen in a fascinating read you won't want to miss.",5.0,1,2021

Just No. Not this.,"Ok so this is an “influencer” cookbook driven by celebrity rather than cooking prowess. But Tiegen is so unworthy. She trolled a 16 year old Courtney Stodden on Twitter suggesting Courtney should kill herself. Ok so let’s call that a fail for role model cred. But what about as a cook? If you need instructions like “use good eggs (the ones with the really yellow yolks)” or if you need instructions on how to cut an avocado then maybe you might get something out of this. Btw wouldnt orangish be a better descriptor for the yolks?  But she is not a serious cook. Watch her cooking videos and she is almost hiding from being seen doing anything directly in camera. She has a multimillion dollar branding gig based on cooking for which she has little skill and doesn’t want to be exposed and blow the whole thing up. This was actually played out in a spat with Allison Roman (who has legit food cred) on Twitter (noticing a theme?). Roman lost that, but her critique was not without merit. It’s just you don’t win by saying ugly things especially when ugly things are directed at a powerful celebrity couple. As for the book itself I’m honestly shocked at how unappealing the photos are. I mean Tiegen and Legend have money to do this right but it looks amateurish in execution. The recipes are trite. Like you get told you should use Mrs Butterworth’s pancake syrup? Am I a food snob or is this just silly? Her crab cake Benedict has “fake hollandaise” aka mayonnaise with sriracha stirred in. Seriously? Just call it sriracha Mayo. It’s got nothing to do with hollandaise. I bought this because it was on sale for $1.99 and I feel like I paid too much.",1.0,0,2021

Pretty good,"Whenever K L Slater has a new book out, I don't bother reading the blurb. I purchase it immediately because I know that in the thriller genre she delivers entertaining reads. I really enjoyed The Marriage despite having worked out early on who one of the culprits was.<br />The premise for this story is good.  Two young friends have an argument. The one is an amateur boxer( Tom) who punches the other (Jesse). Jesse falls and hits his head that results in death. Tom is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Jesse's mother Brigit, joins a restorative justice programme and starts visiting Tom and developing feelings for him. They marry prior to Tom's release despite a 20 year age difference and thus begins the game of who did what to whom and name and blame. 4 and a half stars.",4.0,1,2021

Terrible editing,"At first, I loved this. I could hear Leonard Nimoy's voice reading to me. Then, it all went bad. Typos proliferated. Very little about Spock's time on the Enterprise. I did like the section on his mission to Romulus.  And the end? There are three major gaffs. Spock has no interaction with Kirk at the Academy. He then takes the unmet cadet Kirk to meet his human grandparents. And the next paragraph has him meeting Kirk for the first time when Kirk steps on the Enterprise as Captain. This hideous lapse in editing rather ruined the book for me.<br /><br />So very sad.",2.0,0,2021
Heir and Spare:  Enjoyed book in spite of abuse,"I hate books about abuse, violence - so I wonder why I still loved this book and didn't want it to end where it did.  I hoped for an epilogue.  The hero was too abusive in the beginning and that could have been toned down, but over the arch of the book the changes in him were clear and logical.  So yes, there is violence and a number of other ugly things (and I never ever like them in a book) I am still giving this book 5 stars as I liked the rest of the story.  Still I hope Kate reads reviews and stops with this sort of plot device.  There is no need for it.  Loved her relationship with her cousin.  and maid. And then the Prince too.",5.0,1,2021
Dry And Boring Dialogue,"This story starts off strong and swoon worthy but went downhill pretty fast. There's no real resolution to the story and I despise cliffhangers that are not labeled as such in the description. The H/h had chemistry in the beginning but the dialogue and overall story quickly turned into ping pong style, where the characters talk back and forth with short stilted sentences and no development. It felt like I was reading middle school or high school level work, not something for an adult. There are many stories in this genre that are better written/developed than this one.",1.0,0,2021

Pleasant Second Chance Romance,"It is good to read about two  parents who have misunderstood each other learn how to communicate better by listening  carefully and being willing to clear up misunderstandings rather than holding on to old hurts. Not all misunderstandings can be cleared up this quickly, but some can at least make a good start this quickly, which is all that we actually see happening in this story. But it is a very good start, and will probably result in further progress. This is the beginning of a series, with hints of what will be addressed in other books, but no cliffhangers. I don't mind continuity from book to book in a series, but I hate cliffhangers. When I get to the end of a book, I want to be comfortable putting the book aside and doing something else for a while. I look forward to reading other books in this series because this story is interesting and enjoyable, so I expect other books in this series will be fun to read.",5.0,1,2021

This is the most arrogant ‘has been’ ever!,"This book was awful!  I thought the man focus would be about his encounters with predators in Hollywood. Instead it was about how talented, handsome, charming , and wonderful he was. He told many tales of others telling him he looked like every black male celebrity except Count Chocula. In between talking about his stunning physic, perfect white teeth, and his “good” grade of hair (cause he has Indian in his family), he speaks about how humble and moral he is.  By chapter 12 he hadn’t mentioned meeting anyone, but rather how he was always chosen  for roles because he was so gorgeous. I skimmed through the rest of the book because I was so tired of hearing how everyone, both male and female, were so enamored with him. Ugh!",1.0,0,2021
It's All Here Now,"Wonderfully written detailed biography and inspirational teachings, all in one place.  You've heard the stories before in the tapes and videos over the years, but this book fills in extra details, biographical context that leaves you feeling like you were right there with Ram Dass and the many wonderful people he learned from and hung out with.  As someone whose life was molded by his teachings, it's great to get all this rich extra material.  What a life he led!  He burned so brightly...<br /><br />I particularly appreciate the frankness about the less-than-holy, all-too-human choices and feelings he experienced, as well as more color than previously available about his gay relationships. This is no hagiography which makes it all the more valuable:  If someone is to be our teacher it's essential to have an honest understanding of them so we are aware of their limitations and can confidently and with discernment allow ourselves to be transformed by the teachings.<br /><br />Finally a shout-out of gratitude to co-author Rameshwar Das! However many years this must have required I hope you'll feel it was God's Work. _/\_",5.0,1,2021
One of King's best to date.,"Billy Summers is one of the most complex and multifaceted characters I have ever encountered in fiction, and I've read a LOT of fiction. At first glance, he appears to be a stone killer with a heart of gold, but that doesn't even scratch the surface. He is a skilled sniper, perhaps the best in the business, but that is just a job, one he badly wants to get out of. He gets hired by a group of questionable people to shoot a criminal before he can get extradited. He adopts a ""dumb"" persona as a cover to protect himself. He does the hit but that's when the real story begins. He outwits the group who hired him and that makes him a target. As he is hiding, A young woman, Alice, is dumped from a van in front of his residence. Billy rescues her and then wants to exact his brand of justice on the three thugs that raped and dumped Alice.<br />Interspersed within the main story is a second story, this one about Billy's horrific childhood and his service as a Marine in Iraq. He begins to write about this phase of his life and thus ignites his true passion.<br />Others have mentioned that Billy Summers is reminiscent of 12/22/63 and in many ways it is. It is not horror, not even close (although there are some gruesome scenes), but it is a compelling novel nonetheless. If King ever decides to abandon horror, he could do worse than producing more novels like this one.<br />It wouldn't be a Stephen King novel without a few scattered mentions of items from his earlier work, in this case The Shining.<br />I loved this book. It is everything good fiction should be. I chuckled a few times. I cheered a few times. I also came close to tears more than once. It takes a damn good book to bring out all those emotions. Do yourselves a huge favor and grab this one.",5.0,1,2021
Complex Plot; Fleshed-Out Characters,"A complex plot allows for many twists and turns. Sufficient that a few of them actually do fool the reader.

That’s why I keep buying SK novels.<br /><br />LANGUAGE: As with all King stories, the language and the adult topics need to be noted. For me, it is no problem, though.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Four stars out of five. Even a four star book by the master is a must-read.

This story...,"I apologize.  I tried  to read this and I did read the main story minus all the preacher's fluff!<br />The Oatman Family did suffer immensely.  Lorenzo, Olive, Sweet Mary Ann.  I'm sad and sorry for your losses  and pain.<br />Now.<br />This was absolutely a Preacher-mounted on his pulpit at an old fashioned, outdoor church revival, preaching this story with ""hell and damnation""!<br />The story would have been so much better without his blustering, racist, hate-filled, unholy rantings to boost sales of ""his"" book.<br />I know that cultures vary, but to portray the ""Indians"" in such a dark, evil, lazy, uneducated, wanton light... I don't believe the Indian tribes would have survived even another decade without succumbing to starvation, disease, war or incest per the author/preacher.<br />I know with all the junk preaching wrapped around The Oatman's story detracted for me 100% of reading about Olive, Mary Ann and Lorenzo's survival.<br />I did cry when little Sister passed.<br />I think I read the profits were put towards  the education of Lorenzo and Olive.<br />Whereas the preacher wrote of the  Indians lust and wanton animal- like behaviors, I expected that Olive might have had a baby during her captivity.<br />The time this book was published probably left out that abuse because of protecting Olive's reputation.<br />Omg.  The white captives brought into the village; the young mother escaped, trying to return to her 2 month old baby and husband.  She was recaptured.  Who in the holy hell decided crucifying this poor woman and adding a crown of thorns to her head!!<br />The parts of the Indians asking Olive about Heaven and her belief... wow.  I really doubt that in that era with no missionaries  or priests in the Indian villages... how would the heathens know how to crucify her?<br /><br />The actual formatted version of the book was horrid.<br />And I was surprised at the advanced language and scholarly wording of some of the writing.<br />Remind me... the Dad was a teacher, but I doubt that there was that higher education available on the trail or during captivity.<br /><br />I'm sorry I bought this book.

Hard science-yes; Dialogue-no,I bought this book not knowing the author but hoping for more believable science in the fiction. And the hard science was very interesting. I even laughed a few times. But the character development and especially the dialogue was stilted and often artificial. I even looked up the author to see if the book had been translated because it often seemed like Russian or some other Slavic language badly translated into English. I finished the book because I was curious but not because I identified or even cared much what happened to the characters. I recommend this only to readers who want speculative science fiction and don't care that much about the story.,3.0,0,2021

Basic,"This a very dull basic book, there are some pretty serios things that have happened and everything us pretty much glossed over with one or two conversations. The reason that they broke up in college is ludicrous. The big mystery of why he humiliated her is that he decided to break up with her because he couldn’t focus while dating her (he just loved her too much) and his parents cut him off because his grades were too bad is after 3 years of dating. His “plan” was to get her back when he graduated. Then she blocked him and he was basically like “oh well”. He had completely ghosted her and went the worst way possible. The author thought we should believe this silly bull crap?  He just moved on with his life, he wasn’t living he was devastated without her or really having any problems at all.  Sorry, but I have to pass on the thus, he’s such a whiny baby. When I heard his excuse for dumping her and ruining her and his daughters life it was the biggest wth moment I have had in a book in a long time.  It’s completely stupid and so is she for forgiving him, and he’s an idiot for thinking he has a right to be mad about the kid (she didn’t tell him because he dumped her, blocked her, cut off all means of communication, had said repeatedly that he hated kids and didn’t want them, oh and the kicker was that he had previously started freaking out and looking up abortion clinics when she had a pregnancy scare, this is one case where I feel she was justified in not telling him).

"quick read, pretty good primer on very important info on D3 & K2 (LIFE savers!!)","Pretty good primer on the benefits and need for D3 & K2.  A worthwhile fairly quick read. Read up on as much as you can, from various sources, and your eyes will be opened to the profound benefits of taking D3 (NOT D2) and K2 (mk-7).<br /><br />There are plenty of studies and research information readily available that support using this combo, and not just that but way more than what is generally recommended. The recommended amount is so low that it is really just to keep someone at very basic low level health. Great if you have zero issues and live near the equator. If you live even a little further north (not even the most southern sunshine state in the US has enough sun) the benefits of D3 are greatly reduced. In general, those that live north of the equator, are overweight, and/or dark skinned.. the chances of being deficient in D3 go way up. Add in sun avoidance, sunscreen use, and simply not being outdoors as much.. and the problems that can creep up are astounding. I'm two of three, and I HAD been clinically deficient for who knows how long. My doc recommended testing my D levels as they were reading that those with low D were more apt to not only contract Covid, but to also not fare as well.. so they began testing all of their patients. I started supplementing shortly after with prescribed 5000 IU. Been several months now. My labs brought me up to low normal range. Not yet ideal. Then through much research and analysis have gradually bumped it to 25,000IU (with K2/mk-7-- 100 mcg per 5000IU D3 for balance). It was once I reached the 20,000 IU daily dosage that I began to really notice some positive change (no drive for food, especially sweets, more energy/ambition, less anxiety, stable blood pressure).  Many people do double, triple, and beyond that amount. we'll see. I think that anyone who is dealing with ANY issue should first have their D levels checked, THEN go from there.<br /><br />I just simply recommend doing research (medical journal sites that show abstracts and/or full articles of studies. Much can be learned from abstracts if you dont want a lot of heavy reading, and to look for BOOKS that discuss it, such as this one.. also definitely Jeff T Bowles, Judson Somerville, ).<br /><br />Anyway.. so dont bank on getting a little sunshine to do anything for you. I am not about to go out without sunscreen anyways, and even if I did IT WONT BE ENOUGH. Maybe for a couple of months during summer, but after that we are quickly back at square one. Not even diet is enough (and fortified foods use the synthetic D2, which IS more apt to cause problems than help, so be sure to buy D3 supplements) So... supplement. Should be no issues so long as you are adding in K2 (mk-7) alongside D3. D3 encourages calcium creation, and K2 tells it where to go. Without K2, calcium will be unbound just attaching itself wherever through the body (encouraging problems like stiffer arteries, kidney stones, etc). K2 will direct it to the bones where it should be. Add in some magnesium too while you're at it.  Take D3/K2 in softgel form that adds in some source of fat as this hormone and vitamin needs fat.<br /><br />Good luck!",4.0,1,2021
A Study of horrible decisions,"At first I really didn't like this. The sex is antiseptic, and Eve/April's thought process is completely screwed up.  She is assigned to do a story on prostitution, and of course the only way this housewife of 20 years can possibly write a story on prostitution is to become one. Thank god she wasn't assigned to write about a serial killer or bank robber. She sleeps with guys prior to becoming a prostitute, but condemns the girlfriend her husband picks up as a ""slut"" despite her working all night as a prostitute, sleeping during the day, and leaving most of the childcare to him. At one point she acknowledges she has enough material for her article/book, but decides she's going to turn tricks for another week anyway. I finished it only to catalogue the incredible number of poor choices she makes, we haven't scratched the surface here. I support the legalization of prostitution, as we haven't seemed to affect it any by making it illegal, this book didn't add a lot of insight.  Perhaps if the sex was a little more enticing it might be worth a read, but it's not.",3.0,0,2021
"Strong premise, meh follow through","I'm having to force myself to finish this book, which is never a good sign. And to be honest, there's no Big Fixable Thing wrong with this book. There are just a half dozen smaller things that are grating on me, and make it hard to fall into the story.<br /><br />The protagonists come across as slightly flat. Frankie is an optimist, business woman, friend, sibling, and all around good person. She doesn't have an obvious flaw or development arc that I can root for OUTSIDE of her romantic relationship. The hero is also just... well, look, I'm involved in the kink scene, and I would assume upon meeting him that I would have to be topping him, alright? To each their own, but he has a passivity that makes me uncomfortable in his head.<br /><br />The verb choices in this book are comic-book like in their intensity. Scowled, snickered, popped, twirled, etc. Okay on its own, but annoying with repetition.<br /><br />I find it absolutely bizarre that not one person in the friend group is like... an office manager or a paralegal or something. They all have Cute Quirky Jobs and own their businesses with punny names.  Which again -- happens in plenty of books, but gets annoying when combined with all the other stuff.<br /><br />All in all, this feels like thinly veiled Bucky Barnes/Darcy-like OC fanfic. It's fine. It's... fine. (I have a feeling it will mean the world to the disability community, because like I said-- it doesn't have a fatal flaw. Just a bunch of things that annoy me as an individual.)",2.0,0,2021

Readable through 3/4 of the book...,"Sydney loves Brooklyn. She’s lived there her entire life — it’s where her mother owns a home. Sydney knows the history of her neighborhood better than the pretentious tour guides swarming her area. Slowly, she has witnessed her neighborhood’s transformation. More and more white elite types move in, changing stuff around. Now she’s an undesirable asset in her own hood, and she has all of those “colonists” to blame. Things are moving faster than usual though. Gentrification is not just easing its way in, it is forcing entry in an alarming quick rate. Her old neighbors are gone. Literally. They disappear out of the blue, with zero knowledge of their whereabouts. Strange things continue to occur in her neighborhood, and she wonders if she’s losing her mind. Her ex-husband used to tell her she was crazy all the time, after all, and then there’s her mother’s illness... Perhaps Theo, the cute white neighbor across the street, the one she watches from her window from time to time, may help her figure things out, but should she trust him?<br /><br />WHEN NO ONE IS WATCHING is marketed as “REAR WINDOW meets GET OUT.” This intrigued me. I love both Alfred Hitchcock and Jordan Peele, and a combination of these two masters of horror would be too exceptional for words. However, this is not what we get here. A thriller on gentrification is awesome — and this premise brought me to this book. Many people view gentrification as a good thing. After all, they’re bringing beauty and prosperous businesses in otherwise poor neighborhoods. How could that be a bad thing? Except that the new arrivals drive many people out of their childhood homes, their memories bought off like some insignificant thing. And gentrification does not guarantee long-term success for the neighborhood. In Downtown Los Angeles, apartments and condos, once going for $4K or so a month, are now worth half of that. Why? Because people can’t live there anymore (because of the pandemic), and those who can pay for it don’t want to live there, with all those tents and boarded up businesses dominating the area. Downtown LA is an excellent example of how gentrification could go terribly wrong. I thought I’d read a smart thriller about gentrification and the Karens that take over. Instead, I get a conspiracy thriller with a touch of sci-fi. Not a fan of those, and I had a hard time finishing this book, because the twists are just so ridiculous. What a way to ruin what could have been a subject for enlightening conversation! The book IS engaging for almost all of it. It is after the 3/4 mark that hits south. Sydney and Theo are likable and relatable enough, and they’re the only reason I cared enough to finish this book.<br /><br />Downsides? What I mentioned above, and also people complaining about the foul language. What foul language? I mean, yes, there’s some colorful language here, but not more than the usual. I read a modern thriller version of JANE EYRE recently, and it was like F-bomb city in almost every paragraph. That wasn’t the case here. I have a feeling that most of the people complaining about the “foul language” had only read the opening chapter.

Mostly Braindead,"I'm giving this book 3 stars because it kept my attention, but probably for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />The characters in this book are so braindead, I can't even do it justice in this review! I don't know who is dumber? I think Nic is the dumbest character since he parades Leia around knowing that she's sought after for many reasons and doesn't keep an eye on her. Why take her out at all and put her in these situations where she can get kidnapped, attacked, and/or sipped on? Makes no sense.<br /><br />Leia is the runner up for making a deal then trying to sabotage it over and over, and also for acting like a damsel in distress as soon as Nic is on the scene.<br /><br />This book also ends in a very abrupt cliffhanger after having a dubiously entertaining plot to begin with so I struggled with whether I would get the second book and read on. I did ultimately decide to pick up the second book just to be amused by the idiotic behavior of these characters. I assume that Nic will rescue our damsel and then leave her sitting at a coffee shop or something to be kidnapped by someone else.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't know if this deserves 3 stars beyond the entertainment value of moronic characters.

"""I lift up my eyes to the hills""","""Maybe, I’ll find God in every hill I see for the rest of my life."" - Brother Patrick<br /><br />""Franciscan friar Richard Rohr saysthat there are two kinds of time, at least according to the ancient Greeks. There is chronos—or chronological, ordered time—and then there is kairos. Kairos is subjective, qualitative. Deep Time is what Rohr calls it. A fullness, he says. The moments when the dots of our lives connect."" - from the notebook of Elijah Iverson, Saint, Sierra Simone<br /><br />Once again this brilliant author has enthralled me, captivated me, and stunned me into what she quoted above…into “Kairos”, that deep sense of time that stretches infinitely. The perception of time that sets our hearts, minds, and souls free from the burdens of our reality shackled by the counting of the hours and the numbering of our days.<br /><br />With this work, she introduces us to the making of a modern day albeit, improbable, “Saint”. She also goes where very few authors would ever dare to go blurring or even perhaps obliterating, the definitions of both the sacred and the profane. While delighting the reader with a tension-filled second chance erotic love story, she explores the depths and heights of a man’s quest for mental wellness, atonement and reconciliation of his love and passion for another man and his need to devote himself completely to a God who revealed Himself to him when he needed His life-saving grace the most.<br /><br />This book spoke to me in a very personal way and on a very personal level. It moved me in deep and meaningful ways. I am thankful to Ms. Simone for not only the entertainment but for the joy of contemplating…of being lost in said contemplation. Unlike Aiden, I do not feel I have been called to be a Saint yet. Not so sure I could answer like he did in this book.<br /><br />“Many gates,” I murmur. It’s what I said to Elijah when I was telling him the story of that night. That there are many gates, but this was the one I chose. “Many gates,” Brother Connor echoes. He makes a fist with his right hand and then brings it against his left palm. One of the opening gestures of his salutations. He looks down at his hands. “I often think that if I’d kept my school, if I’d kept my life the life of a martial artist, that I would probably be the same soul I am today. Practice is practice, whether it’s psalms or stances. There are many gates, as you say. Many ways to the well.” - Brother Connor<br /><br />I do believe I could write an essay after reading this glorious life-affirming book. I am that enthusiastic about all I discovered and rediscovered in my thinking. I realize that this endeavor could make for some tedious reading, so I will stick to three themes that enlightened me the most in Saint.<br /><br />I wonder if the temptation to rush to judgement was strong for some when reading how Aiden felt his sexual love of Elijah, and all that it encompasses was like a prayer…a sacred offering of love. He felt closer to God through this love. I often wonder to myself, if the infinite God who created a universe so vast and abides in all his creation is truly worried about how and to whom one expresses their love? Love itself is the essence of God…in every molecule of our very DNA…in every cell of which comprises our temporal body.<br /><br />“This rigid dichotomy of holy and profane, of vowed and unvowed . . . it sterilizes us. Not everyone fits into those boxes to begin with, almost no one fits entirely into them, and then there are those of us who experience God so differently from what is sanctioned and prescribed that even the mere idea of boxes is . . . ” He looks like he’s searching for the right word here. 'Limiting.'” - Father Jordan<br /><br />While I am on the subject of judgement, it is obvious to me now, but I hardly considered that severe depression includes the harshest ultimate self-judgment of worthlessness. The deft and empathetic words given to Aiden as he described the moment of his personal crisis was insightful and moving. Satan is the “father of lies” (John 8:44) Aiden was hearing a major lie or perhaps his faulty brain chemistry was the open door for the lie?<br /><br />If his faulty brain chemistry was the open door for the judgmental lie it was also the open door for his calling to come closer to God...to become a Saint. It makes me think about the idea that this “awesome” God who created all and dwells in all creation “knows the number of hairs on your head” ( Matthew 10:30). “You are precious in his sight (Isaiah 43:4).<br /><br />God was with Aiden when he was in crisis. It was the work of God’s angel or angels that he received the unexpected, jarring, life-affirming text. “For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways”( Psalm 91:11). I understand that Father Jordan talks to angels. I also understand his story is next in the series. I personally cannot wait.<br /><br />More favorite Quotes:<br /><br />""Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; For Love is strong as Death...""(Song of Songs 8:6)<br /><br />""Elijah claims to write in his notebook but instead mostly just stares at me with his arm wedged behind his head and his mouth curved in a fond smile. It should be distracting, and maybe it is, but it’s wonderful too, like praying next to brightly colored stained glass or in a twisting curl of incense smoke. It makes the prayers deeper and sweeter and even older somehow, like I’m praying something beyond the words of the psalms, like I’m praying what it means to be human in the first place."" - Brother Patrick<br /><br />Psalm 121<br /><br />I lift up my eyes to the hills—<br />from where will my help come?<br /><br />My help comes from the Lord,<br />who made heaven and earth . . .<br /><br />He will not let your foot be moved;<br />he who keeps you will not slumber . . .<br /><br />The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in<br />from this time on and forevermore.<br /><br />""I love you like that.

Logan and Cara are definitely a fiery couple!,"Logan Bailey may be the hottest of the Bailey Brothers yet, and not just because he's a fire fighter. Wow, was I impressed not only with the sparks and the steam that seem to follow him around, but also by the size of his heart, and how quickly he gives in to what his heart wants and needs.<br /><br />Logan and Cara have been clawing at each other this entire series, and on the surface it seemed to be mutual hate, but Gram recognized it for what it was all along, and she has the patience of a saint to let it all unfold as it did. Logan previously came across as a bit of an immature playboy, and Cara jumped through hoops to snipe at him at every turn. But sometimes a little bit of liquor makes the truth come out, and that one night of passion changed their lives immeasurably.<br /><br />I was impressed with Logan's growth, and this 100% acceptance and loyalty very early on. It's like he just flipped a switch and grew up, but he still kept his playful nature. He saw Cara so much more clearly once the blinders were off, and he was the only one that really saw her, and really just accepted her for what she was, even when she seemed off the rails. Cara is such a caring and loving person, but it manifests for her in some definitively unique ways, which gives her the appearance of crazy, but it's just a front. She's a little bit fragile when it comes to her heart, and Logan just gets that right away and doesn't let her push him away. He's respectful in his insistence, but he's insistent nonetheless, because he's all in.<br /><br />I really loved watching Cara and Logan both just blossom fully with the care and nurturing that the other gives. They really are two halves of a whole, and their life together will never be boring, that's for sure.  A great read!",5.0,1,2021
Manufactured angst and a long suffering hypocritical heroine.,"I’m sorry, but barforini.

Tough toenails. The fact that her husband is a vicious domestic abusive doesn’t excuse her bad behavior not to mention that her daughter is not her husband’s. Give me a break and bye.<br /><br />This is the 21st century not 1977.

Interesting new series,"This is a review for the whole series because the breaks between the books are almost arbitrary. You'll note other reviews that say this book has a cliff hanger ending. Technically, I suppose that's true, but I think of the endings more like a commercial break in an 80's TV show. The first 3 books complete a plot line. The author has mentioned that there may be additional books in the future.<br />The concepts and world building are interesting and fairly detailed. There are some typos here and there but they aren't overwhelming. The action slows quite a bit in the 3rd novel, as the characters begin to discuss philosophy, more or less, rather than continue to gather new experiences. There's a bit more action at the end, contributing to wrapping up the main story - which involves a conspiracy and various loose ends tied up. There are also many side stories that meander around during all three novels. But the characters are layered and interesting and there is a plot that carries straight through, despite the meandering small plots on the side. I believe this is a self published series, and so I imagine it doesn't have the tougher editing requirements of a big publishing house. However, I really enjoyed the story and found it fun to read. I ended up reading all three, one after the other. And I wouldn't say no to reading a few more.",4.0,1,2021

"Fun, but not her best","SEP has several books I have read over and over, and this is certainly worth your time, but I don't think it's going to be one of those. There's no angry, headless beaver walking down a rural road, but there are 2 strong, likeable protagonists on a journey, which is the basis of all good romances.<br /><br />My favorites of SEP's books make you care about more people than just the central couple. While this includes a lot of other characters, those others are more cardboard than fully fleshed out people.<br /><br />This book is really a 3-star for SEP, but I gave it 4, which is what I would have given to nearly any other author.",4.0,1,2021
A fascinating read,"This was a fast and interesting read. The author managed to cover most theories as to the missing plane. Her own scenario is plausible. I was fine until came across this passage halfway through the book, which I found cavalier (and uniformed):<br /><br />""Even if the fuselage and the two black boxes were found one day at the bottom of some ocean, we won't learn much. The CVR...only preserves...the last two hours...of cockpit noise...and it is not guaranteed at all that any revelations will come from the cockpit in that time period. As for the...flight data recorder...this will only tell us... the aircraft's altitude and exact flight path. Nothing more.""<br /><br />What kind of statement is that? Even if nothing is heard on the CVR for the last 2 hours, that tells you something. And the FDR--only altitude and flight path? Ridiculous. The author even mentions elsewhere that pilots who have been blamed for crashes have been exonerated years later--yet she fails to mention how they might have been exonerated. New crashes of the same ilk and discovery of reasons aided by black box data that can be extrapolated back to older crashes? She even covers that some examples later. At any rate, that passage really bugs me. But I did enjoy the book and she makes a compelling argument. Some will label it conspiracy theory but it seems to make more sense than other convoluted theories.",4.0,1,2021
A Life Too Short,"In the 70s, few sounds could capture my ear as did the melodious voice of Karen Carpenter.  I loved her songs, especially ""Close to You,"" and ""Yesterday Once More.""  She was only a year older than I, so when she died at the young age of 32, I was stunned and heart-broken.  I had no idea that she had anorexia nervosa. I had only heard her on the radio.  I don't remember ever watching her on a television show, so I had never had an opportunity to observe her emaciation (if she didn't cover it up with fashion choices).  When I chose to read ""Little Girl Blue - The Life of Karen Carpenter,"" by Randy L. Schmidt, I had hoped to learn more about her eating disorder.  Although it is discussed in the book, it was not to the extent that I had hoped.  There was a lot of detail about how Karen and her brother Richard got their start as performers. Their mother Agnes always considered Richard to be the gifted musician and never acknowledged Karen's talent as a drummer or a singer. A surprise for me was learning that Karen was quite a distinguished drummer. Even though I knew she played drums, I only thought of her as a vocalist. Ironically, during the years when she sang from behind the drum set, her weight did not bother her as much as after their producers said that with her voice being such an attraction, they would have to hire a drummer and Karen would have to step out front.  Seeing a picture of herself at the front of a stage magnified her childhood fears of being fat.  Things went downhill from there.<br /><br />An interesting aspect of the book was reading about her relationships with her contemporaries. She once dated Mark Harmon and some other celebrities.  She had a brief, but disastrous marriage to Tom Burriss, whom the author portrays as being more interested in her money than in her. She was friends with Dionne Warwick and Olivia Newton John.  The book should be very appealing to readers who are interested in who was who in the recording industry in the 70s and 80s.  Some of those details were beyond my level of interest. The family dynamics were mystifyingly dysfunctional.  Denial of the seriousness of her eating disorder contributed to her demise. I feel cheated once again that such a tremendous talent was snubbed out way before her time.",4.0,1,2021
Cliff hanger,"First the positives. The writing is interesting, the story unique, the power system is new, and there is no lurid sex. The romantic interest is pleasant. Cursing is limited to one angry character (no f-bomb). It kept my interest, and there was a lot of action. Parts of it felt Harry Potter-ish, such as the school, the student interactions, the heirarchy, etc.<br /><br />I somehow got the notion that this book was supposed to be Christian fiction, however, that seems to be relegated to a few scripture quotes and uses of God and demons. God is nowhere in this book. If anything, good and bad is subjective, as both sides seem equally evil. There are many people to feel sorry for--almost everyone. I absolutely despise when authors kill off friendly characters with abandon. The pervading feeling is hopelessness.<br /><br />There are plenty of mysteries and oddities to keep you wondering just what will come of them. Too many ends are left dangling for me, and though I am curious what happens, I don't plan to buy the next book.<br /><br />The rating of TV-14 seems about right due to the violence.",3.0,0,2021
Selectively historical. Fictionally  weak.,"Allowing that this is a fiction of a real person, this work is a shallow read, oozing a juvenile imagination.

"Decent, but cliffhanger with 3 more books to get the whole story","There is no warning whatsoever on this blurb of this book that it is a cliffhanger, and that you need to buy not only 1 additional book, but 3 ADDITIONAL BOOKS to get the whole story. This could have been a good duet, perhaps, if books 1 and 2 were combined, and books 3 and 4 were combined, but as 4 books, costing $12-15 to get the whole story, this just doesn't rank against one great book for that cost.<br /><br />While the author notes that this is part of a series, often romance series are interconnected stand-alones with each book having a self-contained happily-ever-after for that couple. I read the descriptions of first books in a series to see if they mention if they are a cliffhanger or not and this had no mention. So what you have is a book that is less than 150 pages, total cliffhanger with no warning and no mention that you will need to purchase 3 additional books to get the whole story.",1.0,0,2021
Makes me laugh every time,"This is probably the fifth time I have read this book, though the last time I had read it was many years ago. When I picked this book up again, I immediately felt reminiscent of when I read it as a teen & that was just the prologue. This truly is one of my absolute favorite, never go without, must-have-in-my-library-always books.<br /><br />The thing I love most about this book, other than the well-done writing and plot that (1) has no holes in it, (2) a story that isn’t stagnant or has me saying, ‘can we please move on?’ and (3) answers everything that is mentioned so you aren’t left wanting, are the characters and their dialogue. I literally laugh out loud throughout this entire book. You can feel the love and respect the brothers and sister have for each other. I don’t think I’ve ever read any book that expresses this kind of palpable love. I even got so exasperated by a character’s behavior I literally sighed, shook my head and my husband laughed at my reaction, which I of course considered an opening to vent about the character! Lol.  You can’t help but feel the full gambit of emotions with this book & even though I knew what was coming up in the story (since I have read it so many times before, not because it was predictable), I was still so engrossed I couldn’t put the book down! I had to keep reading. I was still mad, happy, sad, and shocked while reading this book and ultimately just fell in love with it.<br /><br />Don’t let the fact that it is a romance put you off. It is not a simple boy meets girl, fall in love, have sex, fight, and eventually just can’t be without each other kind of story. It would be an insult to even try to put it into the same category as those types of romances. Not only do the main characters have depth but so do the supporting characters. This book has multiple little stories that run alongside the main story, without impeding the overall plot or being too much packed in. The author let this book run its course without fear of the page count as well, which just makes it perfect.<br /><br />Another aspect I thoroughly enjoyed were the letters at the end of each chapter, providing yet another, and rather unique, look into the Claybornes’ lives.<br /><br />I will forever recommend this book.",5.0,1,2021
"Liked this series, but someone should have questioned these issues beforehand","First, I really enjoyed the book, but I do have my complaints.  Normally when you have a series characters from the previous books make an appearance or are at least mentioned. In each of the first three books a brother found his love, but there was never a complete ending, no marriage.  You guess it will flow into the next book, but no.  There is never any mention of the three women that each brother ended up with in their prospective  story.  I found that strange, they weren't even mentioned!  Did these relationships end?  The brothers are all mentioned and in each of the books, if they were still in relationships you'd think that there would be at least a mention of them? I found that very strange .<br /><br />My other complaint with this whole series, we had serious situations but at the end they never really explained the details in the outcome.  Why did this person go after the h?  How did the villain get their information?  How were they able to access the homes?  A professional security team and multiple times their headquarters were accessed?  Seems really wrong that if they have their clients staying on their property that people can just come and go on the property, that there isn't a security gate?  These issues come from a combination of the whole series but you get my frustration and annoyance.",4.0,1,2021

When I first read the description for Black Sunshine I immediately downloaded it. The beginning hooked me and I was so excited unfortunately that's where my excitement ended. The author decided to have Lenore intimate with Wolf first which really annoyed me and then were told it lasted for two days. After that the author tries to have us fall in love with Lenore and Solon which for me never happened. His so called possessiveness was lost on me and I didn't believe it nor did I believe in their great love. Unfortunately I found most of the second half boring and a mess.

These people sure as hell are not hiring 18 year olds. They have a bunch of assistants who have college degrees and experience. How hard would it have been for the author to have made this woman a 21 or 22 year old college grad? But, nooooo, we have to have ANOTHER 18 year old virgin who isn't even thinking about college. Instead, this child is pining away for a serious relationship and marriage. Vomit.<br />And what's this about going to bars when she is 18? You can't get into bars at 18 in LA. I mean, why is the author putting this character into such unrealistic adult situations when she is 18? I'm so tired of this. Can we have some heroines who are over 21 and not virgins? Please?!

Uncomfortable truth you need to know,"This book surprised me. In that I’ve read extensively and much “meatier” books on spiritual things (like Dallas Willard or CS Lewis) but she is so straight forward and SPOT ON about the reality that millions are probably walking this earth thinking that because they mentally believe in the facts of Jesus’s death and resurrection they are going to heaven. “Depart from me I never knew you.” It’s not about praying the magic words or going forward in church or at a crusade. That’s “passport Christianity” and it gives you a false belief that you now have your ticket to heaven. A true believer has a hunger for Gods word. A follower of Christ seeks to obey him and turn from sin, not wink at it and count on “grace.” This is a lazy generation mentally and spiritually. Wake up and read this.

"I want to love this, but.....","Ever run into something where you want to say that it was both too much of something and yet also not enough of the same thing?  That's my feeling with arena manager.  It had too much depth at times, delving into obscure plot twists that felt empty, yet, at the same time there was a huge lack of depth to all the character interactions.<br /><br />Worse, while the tale is ""Arena Manager"" there was almost no arena in the story.  Frank the main character isn't always at the arena.  instead he starts out at a farm where he is fighting the monster races preparing to invade the kingdom he finds himself in.  And that spreads in the plot.  Frank argues with knights, and nobles, but rarely actually has a team in the arena, and the training he does is more to help him field a mercenary force than to win arena battles.<br /><br />Its not a badly told tale, but it never drew me in.

I just can’t,"This was a very rare DNF for me. It’s just bad. This guy is thinking about the heroine, but hooks up with 3 different girls in one day. That’s what we read about for the first 40 pages. He cannot keep his hand our d*** out of another girl to even give a decent inner monologue. He’s doing while he’s inside them. He rolls one out of his bed in the morning. Takes off with another after his 8 am class. Was supposed to re hook up with the first girl for a library bj (but we don’t if he did, I’m guessing yes, cause why not at this point) the meets yet another girl that night. 2 out of three it’d these were detailed sex scenes. It just never stops. It’s completely laughable, and bordering on creepy. Yes people like sexZ but this guy has no standards and does nothing else with his life. He’s supposed to be Up for the Heisman award, yet he no practices or anything even at the start of the season. He just has all of the free time in the world to run off with every single skank who smiles at him. He also drinks all the time and jets off to Vegas for the weekend at his leisure. I don’t think this author even understands college athletics at all, or probably even what the Heisman is. Anyway back to the bad plot. The heroine is a virgin of course, per the norm in these books.

Courage is everywhere. Too bad author can’t see it,"I recently heard Ryan Holiday pontificating his book on a podcast. I was struck by his put downs of others who either aren’t courageous or don’t know what it is. Doesn’t take much courage to think we know others.<br /><br />The library book came into my queue, and I decided to give it a try. After a few pages I quit.<br /><br />He says,<br />“When you do the thing others cannot or will not do. When you do the thing that people think you shouldn’t or can’t do. Otherwise it’s not courage.”<br /><br />These words jibe with his podcast interview. The notion that courage is a competition, that it’s light depends on other thoughts and actions. Courageous people could care less. Whether others can do or not is irrelevant.<br /><br />Further,<br />“You have to be braving something or someone. Still, courage remains something hard to define. We know it when we see it, but it’s hard to say it. Accordingly, the aim of this book is not definitions. Rarer than a rare gem, courage is something we must hold up to inspect from many angles.”<br /><br />Not really. Courage is easy to define. And no, it isn’t rare at all. Perhaps Ryan Holiday should consider hanging out with different people, or causes. Courage abounds everywhere.",1.0,0,2021
"I have to give this one 2 stars, unfortunately. SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW","I've read all of Ms. Sharelles  Wounded Souls books and I've liked them all and loved some of them. This one though, I could barely make it through. Ten years. They wasted ten years of their lives. I absolutely HATE stuff like that. Doc was pathetic, he left his ex because she cheated on him, did drugs, and was an all around awful person. Yet, even after he moved to get away from her, he kept going back. He, apparently, fell in love with Meagan ten years back but continued to sleep with his nasty ex for another 4 years. Then, for another 4 years, he stopped sleeping with her but still went to her whenever she went off the rails. Finally, AFTER 8 YEARS, tells Meagan how he feels but then lets his nasty, drugged-out ex into his place, like she's his friend or something. Meagan was just as pathetic, IMO. She waited around FOR 8 YEARS for him to man up. Then, when he finally does, he leaves her that night because of words from her father, and a few weeks later tells her he's having a kid with his ex, CONCEIVED THE NIGHT HE TOLD HER HE LOVED HER! No other explanation than that, and she still just stayed and waited around for him for another 2 years?! Even believing he cheated on her?! Any one of these things from either character was enough to seem ridiculous and pathetic, put all of them together, from both of them, and it was an extremely weak, disappointing AND PATHETIC story. Not to mention the extreme interference in her life from her father WHEN SHE WAS 28 YEARS OLD!!! Saying she couldn't handle the realities of Doc's life, when, by this time, she was a social worker?! Social workers see the absolute dregs of humanity on a daily basis. The interference by her father was meant to seem protective, and maybe if she was 18, 19, or even 21, it would have worked, but she was 28! At that point it was wrong on so many levels. Nothing about this story was anything other than pathetic, and that's a darn shame.<br /><br />1 star - Awful!

Doug does a semi-autobiography,"UNIDENTIFIED is so close to reality (at least for the first third or so) that it reads almost like Douglas E. Richard’s autobiography.  A successful sci-fi-author decides to give up on writing indefinitely to pursue research into the real truth behind UFOs in the mid 2020s, after reading and being teased and convinced by the publicly released US Government on UFOs in 2021 (this is a real thing).<br /><br />The ex-author, Jason Ramsey is rich enough to hire a very expensive, talented and deadly merc, Tessa Barrett as a partner cum bodyguard as he sets out to find out what the government knows but isn't telling.  The start of UNIDENTIFIED plays it pretty straight until it devolves into a near-continuous set of mysteries, plot twists and revelations putting Jason and Tessa in the middle of the fever dream of all fever dreams of sci-fi authors and fans alike.<br /><br />The writing is excellent as it is for all of Richard's novels (I have now read about half of the 20 or so that he has written [much like Jason Ramsey]), and is suffused with lots of pop culture and literature references as much of Richard's other work is.  He is also fond of pairing a male protagonist with a strong female co-protagonist and this one is no different.  The two engage in witty banter and off-stage sex, also a trademark of Richard's.<br /><br />UNIDENTIFIED has enough to satisfy almost any UFOologist/fan and is well worth reading for most sci-fi-fans, although fans of hard sci-fi are likely to be disappointed by the lack of explanation of how the UFOs, sorry, UAPs actually work.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />JM Tepper",4.0,1,2021
Great book,"Wow... I have read all of this authors books and loved them. But this book just left me amazed.  To say this author is creative is an understatement. It was suspenseful, action packed, entertaining and grabbed you before you could finish chapter one.<br /><br />And the gods, oh geeze this book was just fantastic. I wonder what all is in Mrs Johns head? Some things she writes about I would have never thought of. You get Gods, Rebels, Demons, Reapers and Shifters. Just to name a few. Autumn is the leading character. She is strong, sassy and can kick butt as well, if not better,  than any of her mates.

Great brain candy!,"On my list of alien body parts, I like tails. The more, the better. Wish someone would write about kitsune with their nine-tails. (Hint! Hint!) And this is the closest I've seen.<br /><br />Big points to Marina Simcoe and her alien factory creation. She spent a ton of time with excellent exposition in this race's description, definitely in the top five for the past five years. I walked away, knowing Nex and his kind so well, I can see them all perfectly in my mind's eye. Not as much with our heroine Lori, but enough to keep my brain from complaining.<br /><br />As I said, this is definitely brain candy. It does follow the ""Our planet has no women"" template, so if you're looking for something totally original, you won't find it here. But I found it entertaining during a time I'm not tolerating a ton of angst and excessive suspense. If you're in the mood for something fun and light-hearted, this is definitely the ebook for you.<br /><br />World-building and continuity are fine. Editorial content is decent with the usual Simcoe attention to detail. No disruption to my suspension of disbelief.

OFFAL!,"(Homophone intended) This book is terrible!!<br /><br />I grew up reading Heinlein—loved the stuff—so I was excited to learn of these two undiscovered books. What a disappointment. I made it through a couple of hundred pages waiting for the book to “happen,” but I couldn’t stand it any more and finally gave up.<br /><br />It consists largely of back-and-forth repartee between four traveling characters. The trouble is that the banter is insipid, and endless. For example (from a random page)—<br /><br />  “Sharpy darling,” I said gently, “would you like to walk home from two thousand meters?”<br />  “I don’t know; I’ve never tried it.”<br />  “That’s an ejection seat ... but no parachutes.”<br />  “Oh, how romantic! Jake darling, we’ll sing the liebestod on the way down—you sing tenor, I’ll force a soprano and we’ll die in each other’s arms. Zebbie, could we have more altitude? For the time being.”<br />  Doctor Burroughs, gag that hitchhiker. Sharpie, Liebestod is a solo.”<br />  “Picky, picky! Isn’t dead-on-arrival enough? Jealous because you can’t carry a tune? I told Dicky Boy that should be a duet and Cosima agreed with me—”<br />  “Sharpie, button your frimpin’ lip while I explain. One: Everybody at your party knows why we left and will assume that we headed for Reno. You probably called out something to that effect as you left—”<br />  “I believe I did. Yes, I did.”<br /><br />With a couple of short exceptions, that kind of blather continues for over 100 pages before any real science fiction happens. Sadly, when the science does surface, it’s mostly unintelligible. An example—<br /><br />  “May I attempt a novel program? It may save time.”<br />  “Programming is your pidgin. Certainly.”<br />  “Hello, Gay.”<br />  “Hi, Deety!”<br />  “Retrieve late program. Report execute code.”<br />  “Reporting, Deety. ‘Gay Deceiver, take us home!”<br />  “Negative erase permanent program controlled by execute-code Gay Deceiver take us home. Report confirm.”<br />  “Confirmation report. Permanent program execute-coded Gay Deceiver take us home  negative erase. I tell you three times.<br />  “Deety,” said Zeb, “a neg scrub to Gay tells her to place items in perms three places. Redundancy safety factor.”<br />  “Don’t bother me, dear!” She and I sling the same lingo. Hello, Gay.”<br />  “Hello, Deety!”<br />  “Analyze latest program execute-coded Gay Deceiver take us home. Report.”<br />  “Analysis complete.”<br />  “Invert analysis.”<br />  “Null program.”<br />  “Deety sighed. “Typing a program is easier. New Program.”<br />  “Waiting, Deety.”<br />  “Execute-code new permanent program. Gay Deceiver, countermarch! At new execute-code, repeat reversed in real time latest sequence inertials transitions translations rotations before last use of program execute-code Gay Deceiver take us home.”<br />  “New permanent program accepted.”<br />  “Gay, I tell you three times.”<br />  “Gay Deceiver—countermarch!”<br />  Instantly we were over the Grand Canyon, cruising south. I saw Zeb reach for the manual controls. “Deety, that was slick.”<br />  “I didn’t save time, sir—I goofed. Gay, you’re a smart girl.”<br />  “Deety, don’t make me blush.”<br /><br />There’s no shortage of similar gibberish.<br /><br />Terribly disappointed.",1.0,0,2021
"Lovely, fabulously satisfying","This romance novel involves four people: Heather, Joe, Amy, and Ant (Anthony). The first three alternate telling their stories in first person. Heather is one of the author's favorite sort of people to write about: the naïve, immature person who falls into a situation and then adapts. In this case, Heather is plain and shy, and controlling Ant sweeps her up and controls her for the next fifteen years. Joe is a nice, kind, hard-working, thoughtful guy who marries the deeply unhappy, dramatic Amy. When the four of them go on a vacation together to Spain, chaos erupts, and they have to figure out how to live the rest of their lives.<br /><br />This is a deeply satisfying romance. As always, the author sneaks in wonderfully thoughtful tidbits about life. Here are a few:<br /><br />""When had I started counting the hours but letting the years slip by unnoticed? And how the hell had I got to forty without noticing?...as I walked, another sensation rose within me, a strange sense of rage at the way my precious hours on this planet were being wasted.""<br /><br />and<br /><br />""And this wasn’t any ordinary kind of loneliness either. This was an all-encompassing sense of void that left me feeling as if I’d been gutted with a fish knife. It was as though, in the absence of anyone to see me or hear me, I was ceasing to exist – I felt like I was actually disappearing."" (Lynne: this is a result of deep codependency, but only codependents will recognize this sentence, and they, like I, will rejoice in the reading.)<br /><br />I loved Joe's dad. The way he encourages discussion about life, feelings, and why people are the way they are...it's a playground for certain readers, including this one. Thanks to Nick Alexander for sharing that enjoyment.<br /><br />Some might say the way the story ends up is unlikely, but it could happen, and it was greatly satisfying to read. Recommended.",5.0,1,2021
"Entertaining, Enjoyable, And Funny","ETA-Changed my rating from 4 stars to 1-All because of the way book 3 of the series ended. Very upset that the author actually jokes that it took 3 books to get the series actually started, that the book 4 is either now, or soon, available to his Patreon supporters, and his shameful pandering to gain more support through Patreon. I actually took 2 weeks off to come back in and change my reviews. You can see my review of book 3 here on GoodReads and Amazon.<br /><br />First Litprg based book I’ve read. I’m hooked.

LOVED THIS BOOK-Read All To See Why Only 3 ⭐️’s,"Well written, with only a few typos. Not so many I couldn’t get past them, unlike so many other Ebooks these days.<br />Draws you in from the very beginning and your rooting for the main character immediately. The storyline, the characters, the surroundings and habitats are vividly descriptive, and you feel as if you’re watching as a bird from a tree branch up above!<br /><br />I read this pretty much straight through in just about a day because I couldn’t find a good spot to stop. You become so caught up in the “Ohhh, what happens next???,” you just don’t want to stop.<br /><br />I really appreciated the fact the author didn’t dummy down the heroine in the book, or turn her into a sniveling crybaby, who’s not only indecisive but also has that “Prince Charming will find me, save the day, and we’ll go away and live happily ever after with the big castle, 5 kids,, and nothing bad will ever happen again, unless he’s there to fix it and save the day again” attitude  either.<br /><br />Unfortunately so many in this genre tend to do this with the female leads, and I find it deplorable, degrading, condescending, and patronizing toward the female gender. And I’m sure many of you know what I’m talking about!<br /><br />By now you’re probably wondering, if I loved it so much, why only 3 stars?? Why not 4, or even possibly 5??<br /><br />It’s a very simple explanation that brought this on. The first in the series is offered through Kindle Unlimited, the second is not. I read entirely too much to have to purchase every sequel, or trilogy (or more)  which has now become the norm in releasing a book, especially in this genre.<br /><br />That’s what and why I have Unlimited, and it greatly perturbed me enough to knock at least 1 star off, but than when I saw the second book is selling in the Kindle store for $9.99, for a book that’s been out at least a year and a half now, that caused me to take off another star.",3.0,0,2021

"Demonstrates many of the flaws of cultivation stories, but still compelling","I've said that I find many cultivation stories to be very hard to get into.  There is a loss of character when most of the plot surrounds use of elemental powers and training.  The training is all about meditation and taking all kinds of magical drugs.<br /><br />This tale not only is a cultivation tale, but the main character has been time-travelled from his death as a 650 year old near immortal cultivator back to his initial introduction to cultivation when he was just 10 years old.<br /><br />This reminded me of a couple of other similar tales where the hero is an old soul that managed to travel back to the beginning, but kept his knowledge, and of course, this means he's vastly superior to anyone around him.<br /><br />Strangely, this tale manages to avoid completely turning me off despite the flaws in the genre.  Its rather interesting.  The plot makes it clear that Jim isn't just going back in time to relive his past life.  Instead he has a new mission to stop a race that uses ""dark mana"" and will cause the end of the universe should they not be stopped.<br /><br />Its interesting, and the plot never gets too bogged down in cultivation scenes.  The villains were a bit over the top, and there was a clear lack of good relationship building, but beyond that the tale was surprisingly compelling.  Its a low 4 star.",4.0,1,2021

Inspiration and practical ideas for cleaning up life's messes,"Johnson says she wrote this book to give encouragement to readers, to be healthy emotionally, spiritually, and physically. She wants us to be able to deal with the messy parts of those areas in our lives and have all the parts of our lives moving in the same direction. While she shares her insights, she does want each of us to find what works for us.<br /><br />Practical instructions are given, such as cleaning out the junk in our homes and then creating an organized way to live comfortably in the space we have. There are also good spiritual lessons following the practical teaching.<br /><br />This is a good book for young married women and career age women. Johnson has tips on organizing the house, such as having the washer and dryer in a closet on the sleeping and dressing level of the house. Especially with children, it makes lugging the laundry a much easier task. This would be a good book to consult when building a house as design ideas are included. There are also ideas for gathering and hosting, including some yummy recipes. (Note: Johnson is not even close to being a vegetarian.)<br /><br />The financial commitment to do many of the suggestions in this book may be beyond the  abilities of many readers. Johnson's suggestions for what to include in the pool house, the design for a great room, purchasing storage containers, and other ideas may be a prohibitive financial burden to the average family.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book full of practical ideas and spiritual lessons and wonderful photos. It will certainly appeal to readers who want to be on the cutting edge of classy living and entertaining.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",4.0,1,2021

Surprised and impressed me,"This is sold as a ""comedic"" fantasy.  Honestly, I found a lot of the comedy to be forced more than a bit.  The hero had several negative quirks and was deliberately written to be more of a loser than should have worked, and the rest of the cast was largely unlikable.  Honestly, I can't think of a single character from this book that I'd want to run into for a passing conversation let alone a dinner chat.<br /><br />But despite the strange world, despite the characters who were as welcoming as a vat of acid, despite a main character who redefined the term loser.  This story is entertaining.  I did not find it laugh out loud funny, and honestly groaned at most of the feeble humor attempts since it seemed 90% were of the ""glad I'm not him"" variety, and I've never liked that humor.  Yet, it was fun and when I got to the end, I wanted to know what would happen next.<br /><br />So it qualifies for a low four star.  It has flaws, and the characters are not the type you fall in love with, but there is something compelling about the plot and the mystery.  Not a bad book.",4.0,1,2021

Then makes a patronizing point of letting the audience know that we, as humans, will be very excited to find out there is a dog in the story.<br /><br />Like the all icing cake, it turned my stomach pretty quick without something more substantial to hold it up.",2.0,0,2021
Meh....,The only reason I'm giving this book three stars is that the basic information about Julia Childs is interesting.<br /><br />I'm only on page 200 and find the book too long with still 300 some odd pages still to go. The author seems to think that the reader is unable to remember prior remarks made and feels a need to reiterate them. Such as how cantankerous Paul Childs is and Julia Childs inabilities. It's just puff writing to fill the pages. The author just drones on and on.<br /><br /> I find the author rather pompous as he has a tendency to throw  a phrase about prior to the chapter that begins to discuss the Child's time in France. I understand a phrase or two being used at that juncture but don't see the relevance in prior usage.<br /><br />And 'catnip'! I lost count of the times he referred to how something or the other was catnip to Julia Childs or Paul Childs.<br /><br />Overall a mediocre read though the subject matter is quite interesting.,3.0,0,2021
A Fun Read and a History Lesson All in One,"I did not expect to like this novel all that much. So I was happily surprised when I did! Cozy mysteries are my ""escape and relax"" books.

Bedtime story for adults,"The story is a short poem about parenting and taking care of a baby boy with focusing exclusively on the father-child relationship. The sentences are touching, the pictures are simple and the whole book has an intimate and timeless atmosphere. I also liked that the father-figure is created as universal. However the letters could be a little bit bigger - as the kindle version's is really small - and the poem a little bit longer. Apart from that it was nice. Thank you for writing and publishing it for us.",5.0,1,2021
I wish I hadn't read it; I wish he hadn't written it,"I've been waiting for this book for 7 years, ever since The Eye of Zoltar was published. I love the Jennifer Strange books and I really wanted to know how everything wrapped up. Having read The Great Troll War, I wish it had never happened. I have a bad habit of reading the last page of a book and I fought off that desire for this one, but for the first time in my life, I regret not reading it, as it would've saved me from reading the entire thing and ruining the series for me.<br /><br />It felt like a betrayal of the previous books, and the big plot twist was frankly nonsensical. It felt more like Fforde was going to be fined a huge amount for not publishing, so he just slapped together a bunch of random ideas rather than a cohesive plot. I don't necessarily expect happy endings, but I do want them to be satisfying, or at least consistent with the characters. This is neither.",1.0,0,2021
Historian writing for the everyman,"Alistair Moffat is such an entertaining historian that when I feel like reading the tales of 'north sea people', Moffat's a sure bet. And that's how I got into this Moffat installment.<br /><br />Moffat's style is up close and he has the gift of writing to his reader. His audience should have a reasonable grasp of history to begin to imagine the whole. Scottish history largely occurs with not a peep out of the 99% that lived the tale. The Picts didn't write. The weather destroys paper. Most of the story is tinged through the eyes of monks paid to write glorious stories about patrons desiring heaven to hell at the end of the day.<br /><br />Basically, life was rotten. Your ancestors alternated between free and slave depending on the unending wars. The food was horrible. If you got sick or minor injured, odds were good that you were gonna die miserably. You spent the winter in a state of smoke induced hypoxia as chimneys hadn't been invented. And everybody smelled bad. The only good news on the BO front was that you smelled as bad as everyone else and maybe nature canceled out the nasty smell and you maybe didn't notice it. The ancestors must have smelled so bad that modern language must have lost word meaning to describe it.<br /><br />Mofatt is a fun read and a go-to reliable read. Great introduction to now obscure places that are not easily found.",5.0,1,2021

More historical fiction than fantasy,"I've read the first two books in the series. So far it's light on fantasy with the exception of the queen's precognitive dreams, which never unfold quite as she expected they would. That makes the story more interesting. The characters are engaging. The villains are totally evil, the heroes and heroines are flawed, and there are several whose motives keep the reader guessing. The first book ends with the explanations of mysterious and sinister events left unanswered, which is a good way to entice people into reading the whole series.<br /><br />I only have a passing familiarity with the history of ancient Egypt, so I can't say how accurate the portrayal is of life in Egypt during the time following the death of Pharaoh Akhetaten. But the author includes an Afterwords describing how the story differs from the prevailing opinions of Egyptologists (which are still in flux). No one can really know how people thought and behaved back then, but the acceptance of slavery, cruel punishments, and matter-of-fact belief in strange gods and goddesses are quite plausible. The attitudes of the characters aren't static and keep evolving with time, which makes them more like real people.<br /><br />I found that I was spending more time reading the first two books in one sitting than I had intended to, so I have to give the series a good rating for that reason alone.",4.0,1,2021
“The only mother I never lost is the one of my fears.”,"Wow. I wish I read Italian to read the original, but this is an amazing translation job. Vivid showing of a young teenager reluctantly returning to her birth family. It feels real. The writing is fantastic. The descriptions are just enough (Hemingway-esque) and the dialogue is realistic and shows the speaker’s personality. The pacing is perfect and easy. It’d be interesting to read this outside, in the shade of a tree or by the sea, with an orange, or bread and olive oil. But you might end up heartbroken. You could read it on a train but you might miss your stop.<br /><br />The drawback is it left me wanting more…though it ends well. So, off to find more translated novels by this author.",5.0,1,2021
"Utterly predictable, lacking both character development/dimension and plot.","This is one of the authors responsible for my reading the mm genre.  I will read anything and it seemed so many of my go to genres had become repetitive, serial killers instead of murder mysteries, predictable romance, same idea in science fiction and so on.  If the characters are well developed and multidimensional and the plot is interesting, I will read and enjoy the book regardless of genre. The MM genre brought in dimensions which I had previously never considered and raised issues previously not discussed.  The steamy scenes were usually well written and not too much like watching a porn movie (you know you are not watching those for the plot!).<br />The series have gotten weaker as the peripheral characters in the first books became the main characters in ones which followed.  I have no idea why this was made into a 3 book series.  It didn't occur over a long expanse of time as earlier ones did nor were there any dramatic plot lines which left you hanging.  Arguably between 1 and 2, there was an attempt to create this, but it truly failed.<br />The earlier series of books from these authors created a new world of people, place and events that fleshed out both understanding of the characters and a complex and interesting story line. The character Bash is almost a caricature of what the authors seem to think a drag queen might be like should they instead be a successful businessman.  The last Bailey brother (thank God), Kieran was also lacking any dimension.  Unlike the 90s movie where the man falls unwittingly for another man thinking it was a woman (Crying Game), here his error is almost immediately discovered.  Although lacking even the smallest interest in the same sex previously and indeed being apparently quite a ladies man, we are expected to believe that never the less his romantic and sexual interests turn on a dime to those of the same sex.  Really?  Without any internal conflict or doubt, the character suddenly finds he loves a man?  The whole thing just lacked belief. Remember back to the first series where the straight bartender meets the bisexual but gay leaning lawyer and the angst the straight bartender went through finding he was attracted to a man?  That was both more believable as well as interesting in moving the plot forward.<br />Don't get me wrong, this doesn't totally lack entertainment value.  If gives you a chance to check back in with some of the more interesting characters from previous series.  It is basically a harmless bit of fluff that you can read quickly if you don't fall asleep in the process.<br />My last issue is the introduction of the publisher character.  The only reason for the pages about this person was to introduce the main character in the next series of books from one of the authors.  I didn't need the author's note at the end to let me know that was coming.  The entire few pages dedicated to that interaction felt stilted and included only so that a supposed peripheral character can have their own 3 book series.  Remember Robby from the first books mentioned above?  He was the coffee barista who had a crush on the bisexual lawyer.  His character was developed in that story and his inclusion made sense to the plot line.  He also served to tie together characters from other books.  When he became the main subject in a subsequent series I felt I already knew a bit about him and that he had dimensions which left ample room for exploration and his 3 book series was made more interesting by knowing him at a younger age in the earlier books.<br />The whole thing just feels lazy.  The authors are talented and have the capacity to write far, far better.  Let's hope in the future the books will return to that level.",2.0,0,2021
Tawdry Lusty  Regency with fatuitous female,"The story is engaging but there is SO much TMI about people getting all hot under the collar (& lots of other places). I really have no interest in reading about a woman gratifying herself or that the hero she's got the hots for is EXPERIENCED with women ? No matter the genre, if you are writing fiction & including all sorts of unrealistic elements, there is absolutely NO reason to expect  a modern reader to find a whoring man to be a palatable romantic option. With all likelyhood he will have an STD & eventually find he NEEDS to resort to whoring  when his wife is unable to accommodate HIS needs.The  plot is decent but the TMI makes this an eye rolling, tawdry read. Because of this, the characters some across perpetually ""randy"", shallow and cheap. I don't understand why the author feels the need to crudely spell out every little detail of hormonal instances, when a more subtle description makes for a much more satisfying romance. Mostly angry at Amazon for not giving better book descriptions.<br />Amazon really needs to rate books by G/PG/R standards so that you can Know BEFORE paying what you are getting-",1.0,0,2021
I really like these,"It’s a strange and interesting world setup, with erupting super volcanoes bringing on Eternal Night, and a vampire and monster apocalypse upending the human world. There’s a lot going on and the MC, London Hayes, fits right in as a Knight who helps people deal with the fallout. She’s tough, intelligent and she doesn’t think with her hormones. The story has a tinge of romance, but it’s more about saying No than falling into bed. This comes as a huge relief to me, as I am very tired of books that get hijacked by sex scenes, with the stories squeezed into whatever pages remain.<br /><br />I also like the idea of the Knights of Boudicca, as it’s rare to find a fantasy novel that has a sisterhood of warriors. Witches, sure, but in fantasy, women with weapons generally seem to travel alone or in mixed company. Not here though, and the way the Knights were viewed by other people, their home office, how they organized themselves and carried out their assignments all added a lot to the story. Ms Chase has a fine ear for relationships between women, and the ways women tease friends, so her Knights sound to me like a team of athletes who’ve played together a long time.<br /><br />At any rate, Ms Chase writes very engaging stories: I’ve read the first two books in one sitting, and I’m glad there are more books in the series to dive into.",5.0,1,2021

Beginnings of Christianity,"Isn't it amazing that a belief that basically espouses peace, love and 'do unto others…' has been responsible - over eons - for so many millions of deaths, historically restricted logical scientific progress and been involved in child molestation, etc is still actually functioning at all?<br />There is no real explanation of how Catholicism evolved or how the pope became (in the early days) to be so powerful. In the text: the word 'catholic' seems to be originally avoided, then is used once, then not for several chapters….<br />The mere fact that there are so many versions of Christianity (apart from the plethora of alternative religions), surely is indicative of the thought that it is all based purely on hearsay and various personal points of view?<br />Always curious about the confident way very early years are quoted, such as the 300s, when Dionysius did not evolve the current calendar until 532?<br /> STILL - it's a most interesting read of a fascinating subject and imparts a great deal of information - although, some of the text seems a touch 'tongue in cheek' at times??",4.0,1,2021

"Unstable, Mean Heroine Meets Mr. Perfect","I’ve been anxiously awaiting this book, I really like Sarah Adams. But I can’t believe that other reviews would say that this is her best book, when this was a pretty bad book.<br /><br />Sarah Adams always writes spunky, off-the-wall heroines, but this one was also rude to the point of cruelty. The author tries to explain this during the DTR at the end, but I’m not buying. In real life, she would require major counseling before a successful relationship. If she truly had attachment problems bad enough to explain her erratic & inappropriate behavior, then she needs real help. You can’t just snap your fingers and boom...your psychological trauma is fixed.<br /><br />While the hero was likable, my esteem for him plummeted when he didn’t just walk away after her horrible proposal “prank“ in front of 500 of his friends & colleagues. He goes home and is  like “man I love this woman“ when a sane person would say “this woman is insane, and not in a good way.”<br /><br />I don’t like to impose my morality on authors, and there was nothing inappropriate in the love scenes in this book, but it did seem strange to me that someone who had a very bad experience with sex in an uncommitted relationship would suddenly throw her trust issues out the window and be willing to have sex with someone who wasn’t a permanent, signed-on-the-line part of her/the baby’s life. Seems like that would’ve been a good time for restraint.<br /><br />If a good novel helps you suspend your disbelief so that you can enjoy it, then this is not a good novel. I wish I had not spent my time. That said, I really have enjoyed her other books. Maybe I will go back and reread the therapy dog one...my favorite.",2.0,0,2021

Book review for “Acceptance is my Superpower“,"This is a wonderful book about acceptance!<br /><br />Lisa is seven years old and was teased by a classmate because she wears glasses. She tells her Mum that she wants to be like the other kids. Thank goodness for smart mothers! Her Mum says, “We all have our differences making the world an interesting place.“ Both her parents help her to look at differences. From different types of physical characteristics to different types of fruit!<br /><br />The book goes on to explore with Lisa and her family how people are different, “ We all have our differences,” Mum said, “it’s what makes us so unique from the way we look and think to the languages we speak.”<br /><br />Physical diversity is explored. There’s Uncle Jimmy who uses a wheelchair. Grandma talks with sign language using her hands. A friend who is adopted. All are examples of physical diversity.<br /><br />I love how her Dad explains, “To accept each other‘s differences,” Dad said, “Is called diversity, and it means we must treat everyone with respect and courtesy.“<br /><br />This book has lovely illustrations that add to the storyline. I like how the writing of the story rhymes! This book is pleasant to look at and fun to read! Best of all the lesson is learned about differences and diversity. “...acceptance is our superpower and together we will grow.”<br /><br />Be sure to check the very back of the book for a little exercise of writing six things down that you love about yourself. A good exercise for both the adult and child to do together!",5.0,1,2021
"Its not Binding Words or Aether's Rebirth, but its a good solid series and story","One thing I've noticed with Daniel's tales is that he tries too hard to link them.  There are a couple of times in this story where the main character thinks about or mentions events in other Daniel Schinhofen written stories.  None of them are egregious, but it is there and its noticeable.<br /><br />That said this third book in the Luck's Voice series is a decent entry that suffers from a similar problem to all of Daniel's tales, and that is having a lot of filler.  This story started in book 1 with Doc Holyday arriving in Deep Gulch and realizing that there was a problem.  Yes, he was sent by a goddess so the fact that there is a problem was not a surprise, but it was still a moment of ""change"".  He spent book 1 getting established and book 2 making some solid advances towards solving the towns problems and completing his first task in saving the entire world from the darkness.<br /><br />You'd think as this point, with a whole world that eventually needs to be cleansed that book 3 would finish off the storyline of Deep Gulch and start the process of heading to the next problem.  That would fit the standard trilogy format (a beginning, a middle and an end) and would ensure that the story did not get bogged down in minutia.<br /><br />Well, sadly, Breaking the Bank definitely revels in some of the minutia as it plays to some of Daniel's biggest weaknesses.  Yet, its not a bad book or even a ""merely average"" book.  Its good.  I enjoyed seeing some of the characters grow, and the intrigue remains compelling despite being rather formulaic at times.  I just felt that not enough happened in this book to call it great.  It just never stepped forward with a big pivotal event that justified the pages of mundanity that was Doc going about his life as tiny steps towards saving the town were being implemented.<br /><br />This remains a series I enjoy and where I'll watch for the next book, but it will not be with the level of anticipation I keep for the Binding Words and Aether's Rebirth series.  This one just lacks a bit of the magic.  Still its solid.",4.0,1,2021
Embitterment in regard to AI,"AI is one of the most important innovations in the last decades. But the author of this book claims that the current application of AI is bad. It requires computers that use rare material, the mining of which harms the environment, and it uses inaccurate training data, to list some of the arguments presented in this book. But when considering these drawbacks against AI's blessing (automatic translation, contribution to medical research, etc.), the criticism seems to be not justified. The author blames AI for searching order in an infinitely complex world (in the Conclusion chapter), but she ignores that this is exactly what science does. The book also includes many interesting reviews of the history of science and AI. I enjoyed very much reading these reviews.",3.0,0,2021
The Circle of Life,"""The Four Winds"" by Kristin Hannah"" kept me engrossed of the times our ancestors, my grandparents, my parents, father born in 1910.  The struggle and starvation they went through. The Great Depression and before as their were troubles with weather, no work, etc. My father, the youngest of nineteen, with his hard earned High School Diploma left the State of Maryland, a suitcase, a few odds and ends in hand travels to the State of California from the State of Maryland with two other fellow friends. They all had high hopes and dreams of what was waiting for them in what is known as the San Francisco Bay area. A future with work, a place to live. They all found little work, no housing nor food. Bread lines, people starving, homelessness. Meals, food consisted many times of ketchup and water for soup. Bread lines, and working odd jobs for a dime. The rough years of the Great Depression.  He did make it in his knowledge of horticultural that he studied growing up with his nineteen siblings. His Father was a sharecropper. My father and his siblings were hardworking, some scholars. My father studied Latin in school, played soccer, studied commercial art and architecture. Well spoken, kind and shy ""his classmates"" they said of him. So handsome,  the youngest of nineteen. Many of his siblings stayed in Maryland. But my father headed to the Golden State of California. He did odd jobs and then found himself  as the Master Gardener and worked the whole of ""Live Oak Park"" in Berkeley, California which still exists today. Long hours, and on weekends, with the exception of Mass on Sundays, but then work for him being the personal gardener of the well off people in Berkeley and Oakland Hills, California. At times he would take the older of us along with him. He fed his family of ten. We grew up with a decent home over our heads, healthy, mostly homegrown food. My Mother baked and cooked. My father shopped the list my Mother made for him. They made it through hard times and never wanted any government hand out. We grew up without much, but they made it. My parents taught all of us the of love gardening, baking, reading, going to the library and how to survive. Chickens were a big help to us. I know many families washed their clothes and hang them out to dry. My Mother taught us well. I know there were times I questioned why we did not have what others had as I know my sister's and brothers did. One big Catholic family.  Today there are an abundance of homeless people, out of work and some who choose not to work. All States have been going through droughts, floods, fires, disease and now the Covid Virus. Some are mentally ill, or physically ill. Others have turned to some sort of Addiction, alcohol, drugs, etc. Something is wrong how everyone is so divided today. We all need to unite again. I do realize the pandemic has not helped. After reading Kristin Hannah's ""For Winds"" I feel it is going around in a Big Circle. This novel is a must read on my list!

A Horrifying Scenario Becomes Reality,"You know, when you stir up a hornet’s nest, you’re gonna get stung.”  by Bobby Akart in Nuclear Winter *****<br /><br />From the first word read to the last page turned, I knew Bobby Akart had a brilliant, engaging, horrifying tale to be told.  He entwines the readers from the first page as he slowly introduces the Albright family, owners of a resort inn halfway down the Keys in Florida.  Author Bobby Akart excels at allowing the reader to become part of the Albright family with members stretching from CA to DC to the Keys.  We cringe and bite our nails as we watch how they react to the horror coming their way.<br /><br />The suspense, the behind the scenes machinations of governments, the evil unleashed, the world on an uncharted path are all woven into another excellent story. As the author writes “......words will just be words until you act on them.” The reality of nuclear disaster is just beginning!<br />Well done, Bobby Akart.",5.0,1,2021
Eh....,"While rock star romance books are my favorite, this one just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The story was written well, and it had moments that were cute but it was basically a Pretty Woman rip off.  Literally from pick up a hooker while in a fancy car... the hotel, the snobby woman in the lobby, the shopping trip, the quirky best friend/roommate hooker... I half expected the band manager to be another Stuckey.  These things turned me off about this story.<br /><br />Then there were the sex scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I am not opposed to a good sex scene (rock star romance books are my favorite after all) but there were SOOOO many in this book I just started skimming over them.<br /><br />I have read Michelle Mankins books before, and I will likely read more in the future.  I won't be reading the quirky best friend/roommate's book however, which is next in the series.  I think I've had enough of the Pretty Woman spin.<br /><br />Still, a two star read for me.

It is too bizarre , in parts, to be a novel that someone would try to fabricate.  If you have a combat background you'll find this a unique read.  And if you don't you're still likely to enjoy it if this type of story interests you.

"have enjoyed other books in this series, but not this one","Prior to this book, I found this series to be delightful. I found this one somewhat annoying and to be incongruent with values and dispositions of the characters from the previous books. Lady Charlotte seems to have lost her courage and tends to worry constantly, over scenarios she, in the past books, would have been mostly OK with. Her continuous worry was the annoying part of this book. I understand she was also worried about the bad guys, her family, and the wedding and giving up her freedom, and such, but it was just too much worry and negative introspection. Putting the weasels in danger didn't seem to fit either. And, the storyline was somewhat predictable and got so complicated in the end I didn't really care anymore and just sort of skimmed through it. Wrexford did not comes across very well in this book either. Not sure why but he wasn't very ""likeable.""

Interesting Recipes,"As the title explains, this cookbook is devoted to a wide variety of empanadas.  The recipes are clearly written, however in some of the recipes early in the book, it doesn't tell you whether the oven should be preheated or cold.  I defaulted to preheated because that is the usual practice.  The empanadas turned out fine.  All the recipes include preparation times and nutritional information.<br /><br />The book is disorganized, as if the author(s) put the recipes in the order they found them.  The book would be easier to use if they had at least separated the recipes by sweet and savory.  Other issues include using a light-colored font for the directions, making them are to read against the white page, and incomplete bolding in the ingredient lists.  For example, one recipe calls for several kinds of sugar, but only the word ""sugar"" is highlighted.<br /><br />These recipes come from a variety of sources, including individuals if the titles are accurate.

…and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder. ~ Jane Austen,"Reading so many JAFF stories over the years has often left me wondering about the fate of the sons.<br /><br />A daughter — no matter where she lands in birth order — is given as generous a dowry as her father can afford.  Oldest sons inherit everything else — or very nearly everything, it seems.  So many younger sons receive an education (maybe), an Army commission purchase, a clerical living, or sometimes nothing.  Younger sons must grow up and make a life for themselves.<br /><br />It often seems to me that the oldest sons are the ones shortchanged by this system.  So many oldest sons live idle lives, spending freely, gambling, or supporting mistresses.  No responsibilities until they inherit.  So many worthless lives!<br /><br />“The Colonel’s Brother” lives one of those idle lives.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story but I agree with another reviewer about the climax event.  I was reading along, having a chortle here and there, and then, suddenly, out of nowhere — BOOM!  If only the author had given some hints of an emotional crisis brewing.<br /><br />I would have rated this much higher with some advanced warning.",3.0,0,2021
It's obvious this is a first novel.,"This turned out to be my second ""first novel"" I've read in 2021, and like the other one, its pretty clear that the author has some talent, but is woefully inexperienced in just how to make a story shine.<br /><br />This isn't a terrible book or an unreadable one.  However, it lacks any real flair and many of the passages and characters are amateurishly created.  The story could have been quite good as we have the story of someone who figures out a way to move between a fantasy world with magic and our own.  (well, he stumbles on it and then finds out others know of it, but don't have the power to move back and forth freely while he does.)<br /><br />As one might imagine said hero ends up planning on running the trade angle.  Go to fantasy world with silver and gold coin blanks, purchase items and then return to sell them to collectors for very high markups.  But the story quickly veers off into owning women purchased from the world, and the hero's near incompetent adventures.  Along with his sex with said women he owns.<br /><br />Characters?  Not really, the hero is typical harem tale quality, which means he's given a backstory that doesn't match his actions and he comes across as a complete imbecile at times.  Honestly, part of why I hate this genre at times is just how poorly thought out the MC can be, and the one in Ruby Mage is definitely in the bottom 5% in regards to sense (common or otherwise.)  The rest of the cast is even less developed with his first woman being a bimbo amazon fighter who is submissive to the point you wonder how she can stand up and fight a breeze, let alone any of the monsters from the world.<br /><br />And the world?  Honestly, I can't think of how to describe it.  its not developed at all.  It is unbalanced in so many ways as to make it hard to credit as workable.  And the author wanted to describe every town/city as a cesspool of foul smells and ignorant hicks living there.<br /><br />I can see talent here, but this is also very clearly a first novel.  The plot meanders without locking into any path.  The characters are weakly developed and wind up passengers on the plot.  And with the slow and unfocused plot you end up with a story that is more a cure for insomnia than a compelling read.<br /><br />I give this a low 3 stars.  Its not terrible, but Dan really needed to develop his writing voice and style a bit before trying to put together this ambitious tale.",3.0,0,2021

Oh YES YES YES!,"Have you read this series yet? No??? WHY???? It freaking rocks. It is funny, intriguing, suspenseful, heartwarming and did I say funny? Because this series has me laughing way more than most.  Def and Nette are freaking amazing besties and their banter is hilarious.

It's perfect for the story and I gotta say I need me a kilt wearing wolf shifter with a sassy Irish brogue. Because... you know... reasons.

Loved this start to a new series! The characters were strong and the cat was awesome,"Even though this is a modern day mystery, it was so cool how it had vibes of old gothic stories or sometimes even Downton Abbey. I loved their secret book club room, but the reason they had to keep it secret was really just sad. The murder mystery was a good one, and the house was the perfect setting for a bunch of women to go sleuthing and sneaking around. Fellow housekeeper Mary seemed to be Laura Lee's good sleuthing buddy as they discovered secret rooms and doors in the process, usually accompanied by Hank the cat.<br /><br />As the story progressed, I started getting a feeling of whodunit especially after some good clues. And the chauffeur may not have been the only murder to happen at the estate. Lots of secrets were held by different people, so there were quite a few suspects. Secrets always have a way of surfacing, so by the end, everything seemed to be well-explained, but I'm sure the house will still have the same cool and creepy atmosphere to it when I read the next book! Oh, last but not least, Hank the cat was a superstar as far as characters went. If that little guy could talk, the case would have been broken the first day most likely! What an awesome kitty!",5.0,1,2021

We must take her word for it,"The subject matter in this book is repeated over and over.  The only change comes with the name of a different company, person, location, worm, hack, or etc. etc.  There is nothing new here that hasn't been covered by other authors over the years.  What the title implies may indeed happen on a much larger scale in the future, compared to previous cyber activities that have already happened to date.  But, that is not a given.<br /><br />This is the most unsourced and undocumented screed I have ever read, no footnotes, no biliography, no nothing (just mentions scattered everywhere).  Dates aren't her forte -- although there are some references throughout, here and there.  She needed a good editor, it reads like she didn't have one.<br /><br />Perlroth seems to trust the word of hackers who find the zero days until they disappoint her.  At the same time, she has an extremely negative view of the U.S. Gov't, the Intelligence Community (IC), and their activities.  There is more to it than she will ever know.  I just hope her curiosity does not kill the wrong cat.<br /><br />Personally, I would much rather have our U.S. IC keeping tabs on zero-days and hackers, and infiltrating systems to monitor who is accessing and what they are doing.  I think Perlroth missed the nuance -- there is more going on behind the scenes for good -- to stop the full effect of world-ending cyber attack from occurring.  She seems to believe that the U.S. is up to no good, and lacks ethical standards.<br /><br />One thing is for certain:  the cyber problem -- for ill -- is a war that bad actors started.  Without ethics or morality, they started it to win it, and they have no desire to end it until they are in control.  The U.S. must not allow a bad actor/s to blow it all up and rebuild it more to their liking.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very long opinion piece from a New York Times journalist.  Her delivery is what I expect from a Greg Jarrett or other conservative writer, not from someone with her level of experience.  She shares most by-lines with other writers at the NYT, and those articles I have enjoyed -- but -- they usually contain at least some sourcing and documentation.",2.0,0,2021

The reader does get a bit of the average struggles and challenges the settlers faced, the food they ate,the dangers they faced, and the mentality and prejudice of the times.

...and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges. ~ William Shakespeare,"One of my GoodReads friends, a woman who spent her career in police work, often includes this sentiment in her reviews:  I always like it when the villains get their comeuppances.<br /><br />I confess that I also like to see a punishment to fit the crime.<br /><br />And that is my main criticism of this story.  One villain is punished; another is allowed to escape.<br /><br />A half-truth is a whole lie. ~ Yiddish Proverb<br /><br />George Wickham knows that the best lies contain elements of the truth.  That is why he can be so very convincing.<br /><br />In “Danger at the Netherfield Ball” a perpetrator escapes comeuppance by a half-truth, at least within the timeline of the story.  It disappointed me enough to drop a star.  In my imagination, I follow the story some months (or years) and I am sure of appropriate retribution.

No! No! And NO!,"Too many problems for the keto lifestyle. 1) Keto recipes don't call for sugar and honey. 2) There is no nutritional information given so who knows HOW many carbs are in the recipes. 3) Some recipes have American measurements while others have European measurements. I don't use European measurements so I don't plan to try a lot of these recipes. 4) Some recipes give measurements of fruits while others just list fruits with no instructions on how MUCH of each fruit to use. Seriously? There's a big difference in 1/2C of strawberries as opposed to however many strawberries you want (in addition to how much of all the other fruits you might want).<br /><br />Honestly I have no idea why anyone would even consider this on keto. It might be a perfectly fine collection of recipes for John Q. Public, but for someone on keto it's a waste of time. Why it wasn't marketed without the word ""keto"" is beyond me. Sure, I understand everyone wants their piece of the keto market, but when you don't bother to provide anything useful to those of us actually on keto you aren't going to make much of a dent in the keto market.

"Interesting, but too much angst.","I'm one of the few who are less than thrilled with the ""Dead Witch Walking"" series, so take this review with a large grain of salt. I find the reality created by Kim Harrison creative and interesting. The characters are unique with powers and unusual drives centering around their magical nature. They aren't human, and don't have human desires--sorta.<br /><br />But I did get tired of our heroine getting involved in an endless series of disastrous emotional and physical situations, often of her own making. The physical dangers are frequent enough that survival is ridiculous, but I REALLY got tired of the constant angst, sexual tension, self-criticism, second-guessing, doom and gloom. Sometimes ya just want to shoot the bad guy in the face and go for a beer. But that's just my two cents.",4.0,1,2021

Jude goes off to war and comes back trapped in the mind of someone he doesn't know and doesn't like and it obviously has a horribly negative impact. Through all iof the struggle and heartache, and some serious mountains that need climbing, they find each other again and it's magical. Purely magical.<br />I will never admit just how many tears I shed while reading this book.

I Prefer the Company of Dogs for a reason... )<br />Anyway...<br />Phenomenal book. Anyone to talks trash about it need to go get a grip and a life.

Worth the read!,"If I'm being honest, I was a little skeptical about this book when I was choosing my February pick for Amazon's First Reads. That said, this book didn't disappoint! The storyline was pretty cute and there were times where I actually laughed out loud because the writing was so funny and clever. That doesn't happen a lot when I'm reading! The chemistry between Alec and Luna was great and their personalities really shone through. I found Thad to be a little irritating, but I think that was kind of the point. If you like rom-com stories, I'd definitely recommend this one!",5.0,1,2021
80 Books and each one a Keeper,Again I kept my kindles rotated to stay up until the wee hours of the morning to finish this book that I could not put down to sleep...Thank you Mr Petit for the many many hours of wonderful stories that you have given me and so many of your fans to read over and over.  I have almost all of them in my library and I take them out for a spin of a reread once in a while and each time I still love the story and the story teller.

Tal Bauer is back and is even better than I remember! Loved the story!,"Tal Bauer is back with this wonderfully intense and suspenseful second chance romance! Great chemistry, serial killer plot with a twist, emotions pouring across the pages and the best happy ever after! It has it all. The details and research are top notch, the writing is smooth and engaging, the MCs are likeable and easy to relate - I breezed through the book and didn't want it to end.<br /><br />Both MCs, Noah Downing and Cole Kennedy, are FBI agents. Their first meeting is pure chance or maybe Fate that sets the tone for the entire story - instead of two agents working tirelessly to find the killer, they are two agents longing and desiring each other so much that they can't see straight while working tirelessly to find the killer. Noah's journey of self acceptance and self discovery is at times painful but so important for him to go through. Mr Bauer has truly shined the light on the fear and anxiety of coming out among slightly older generation and how much it affects their life and happiness. Cole is a complete opposite of Noah. He is secure in his feelings, desires and how people view him both as a man and as an agent. He helps Noah to go through ups and downs without a second thought. The two men are so perfect together.<br /><br />The mystery is well paced, well written with a wonderful twist in the end. The profiling done by Cole is simply brilliant. The case is gruesome, the investigative process is realistic and well detailed. I enjoyed every page. Tal Bauer wrote an incredible story. Again.",5.0,1,2021
Another Isekai that doesn't entirely miss,"I know, it seems like I'm using faint praise here, but honestly I find most tales in this genre to be so heavy on the wish-fulfillment that character and plot can be lost.  This tale manages to have a main character who after one really, really stupid mistake (that does make sense based on the overall plot, but still had me thinking that it was a bit too contrived) manages to turn her life into one heck of a theme park ride as a combat healer with some strange boosts and restrictions.<br /><br />Overall the main character is interesting, if more than a little naïve and sexless.  She does have some knowledge from Earth, but its conveniently partial so the author got to throw in some culture references while having an excuse for why many modern conveniences aren't going to flood into the world.  Beyond that she's a healer who spoke an oath more restricting than any doctor on Earth would have used, and this in a world where oaths can have levels and power.<br /><br />But that's what this world apparently is all about.  Every chapter ends with a rehash of the heroes current skills and stats, which was more of a padding of the page count that truly useful.  Honestly, I stopped reading them early on, as I wanted to get back to the story and the main character's journey.<br /><br />But that's what made this work.  The journey was exquisitely crafted and well told.  I devoured this book because of how much I wanted to watch as our heroine grew into an amazing healer.",4.0,1,2021

Interesting premise with a side of racism,"It's very unclear as to why this story has several racism undertones, such as the main character arising from a racist group, an altered timeline where the Confederacy won the US Civil War. Overall the racial undertones feel somewhat off. The story goes on to show that the protagonist is at least trying to not be racist anymore because now they have ""green-skinned"" to fight. I am interested to see where the story goes, but I feel the story's historical undertones don't make this story quite as good as it could be, as there seems to be little to no point to the racist undertones, as presently all they seem to help with is establish that the main character grew up taking out his frustrations on  what in this timeline was the losing side in the US Civil War, with little to no direct reasoning.",3.0,0,2021

Incomplete and somewhat incoherent.,"This was extremely hard for me to get through.  The basic idea was not too strange for an Isekai tale.  The MC ""died"" on Earth and wakes up in a new body in a world of magic and LitRPG rules.<br /><br />Of course the rest of the world foundation was just bad.  The class system did not make much sense, and worse the leveling was not clearly presented.<br /><br />It did not help that the MC was presented as a bit of an idiot savant.  He was overly knowledgeable about mechanical items, but struggled to understand the world.  At the same time, he was able to tell stories that came from our world, and even invent items basically by redesigning something that we take for granted in the 21st century.<br /><br />And then the story just gets tied up in day-to-day minutia.  Yes, I like Daniel Schinhofen's stories which can often get wrapped up in the daily lives of the characters, but in those stories, the characters and the worlds have far firmer foundations than this trainwreck of a tale.<br /><br />But it was not impossible to read.  Just one that had me taking a lot of breaks and reading very slowly.  It took me much longer than normal to finish this book because I did not really care to spend that extra few minutes every night trying to read a bit more.  I'd stop very early because it just wasn't that fun.",3.0,0,2021
Underwhelmed,"I made it to chapter 3 before giving up on this book.  Like so many others, Mr Carpenter’s knowledge is clearly centered on firearms, and self defense scenarios taught at his local firearm academy.  His story line falls apart immediately when he presents his main character, Randall Parker, as a young man who makes his living as a freelance ghostwriter for “large wilderness survival and disaster preparedness web sites”, as well as “running his own blog and writing his own survival ebooks” - yet he has him living in a condo, in which he has a 6 month supply of food and water, and the requisite well-stocked gun cabinet?!  Ummmm, since he works from his computer, as a ‘prepper’s prepper’ to boot, why is he living in the city - in a condo?<br /><br />Then, while writing an article on his MacBook in the middle of the night, the EMP hits - which he recognizes for what it is right away, yet he sets about stopping up the drains in his sinks and tub and collects nearly a 100 gallons of water (even though he and his family have designated the grandparent’s cabin, a hundred miles away, as the bug out location where they would all gather) as if he will be staying in his condo for a long time.  Geesh!! I could go on, but it’s glaringly obvious that this story is just another testosterone-fueled firearm fantasy.",1.0,0,2021
Searing Sexy Romance...Sensational Subtle Subtext,"If you like it hot, angsty, all hate-effery , Alex Wolf never fails to turn up the dial. He writes the perfect Alpha-hole with the undeniable touch of testosterone that comes from a male author of romance. The heroine is a bit OTT with her emotions, but she comes  across as a woman who is nobody's fool. She is written respectfully and not as a caricature of womanhood. It is wonderfully predictable to those of us who love the art -form.  However, I caught a glimpse of something else our author was trying to say through the setting of this swoony romance.<br /><br />The heroine works as a writer for her local Kansas City newspaper owned by an aging couple whom she dearly loves. Their paper is no longer financially viable because the couple, while establishing a sterling  reputation for news reporting, failed to keep up with the necessities of an online presence. Our hero wants to buy them out and make the newspaper part of a media syndicate. This is the central conflict between H/h.<br /><br />When did it happen to us? Can you remember reading the daily paper and really knowing what was happening in your community? When did it become so much more important for us to have  ""the news"" digested for us and spun out one way or another to make us feel we were on the side of the ""angels"" if we thought the way the news personality did? When did hearing an opposing opinion bring us to the point of rage? When did we stop watching the news from sources that publish their ""Standards of Practices"" for journalistic integrity and start watching ""News Entertainment Networks that have "" No"" such practices?  When did we allow ourselves to be manipulated by the billionaires who care only about the game of making more money?<br /><br />Funny how the thing that saved the day in this story was genuine true spiritual love...it also saved the local paper.  It is the same thing we need to give each other and our country... some hard-fought, soul- searched, well thought -out ... love. Even if that means entertaining the possibility that we may have been wrong about our conclusions. We may have been manipulated...made to fear...made to believe things that could not be true...made to fight for causes not  worthy of our noble hearts.<br /><br />As Americans, we have been blessed with a beautiful land and heritage, certainly not perfect. We should love her enough to listen to one another and do what it takes to make her better, more perfect even if it means letting go of thoughts that seem like simple explanations or solutions, when complex problems  are only made worse and even more hurtful to someone who is unfairly disadvantaged by simplistic tribal thinking. We need to love one another enough to weigh the words uttered by the media with an ear toward bias, (even if it aligns with our own) and manipulation for the truth of any matter.  We need each other now more than ever in so many disparate ways.  We cannot afford to lose one soul unnecessarily.<br /><br />Yeah, I read all of that from the subtle subtext of this book.

Hard to finish,This meddling moms story was just annoyingly below par. The lack of connection between the moms and their kids was lacking. I couldn’t believe the moms had that much sway with their adult-over-the-age-of-thirty children. The memories were mostly believable. The pranks were not funny. The call to design the glamping cabins was unbelievable as an emergency or even a genius idea.  I wasn’t convinced Brogan actually fell for...what was he name? Completely forgettable.,1.0,0,2021
Another 18 year old virgin,"Dodge has been waiting for his next door neighbor, Heather to turn 18 for the last four years. (As if that's not creepy.) He's 20 years older and a ""monster"" of a man. He wants to do her in all kinds of ways, take her cherry, get her pregnant. Blah, blah, blah. The reindeers, the conflict between neighbors and his former classmate, Davis are all secondary, and wrapped up very easily in a page and a half at the end. Mostly, this is about sex and the heart on these two have had for each other for years. I've read lots of erotica. This is just the typical stuff., the same tropes and cliche scenes. Can people stop biting their lips or tongues or whatever until they bleed? What is that line about anyway? And can someone please tell erotic romance writers that many women don't find choking on a penis sexy? And can you please get better proofreaders? It's ""their"" not ""they're."" The story ends with Heather giving birth to her fourth child in six years. She's also managed to graduate from college, helps run her husband's business, and Dodge is now wealthy! Of course! Obviously, we all know getting pregnant and married at 18 to a hyper possessive not very bright guy always works out so well. The sex is not good enough to overlook this drivel.",2.0,0,2021
Breath of Fresh Air!,"I about highlighted the entire first chapter and almost definitely intending to use that information one day for a lesson at my church. It is drastically helpful! I've been really hesitant to delve into eschatology and biblical theology at any depth precisely because I know there are presuppositions waiting to meet me at the door of the first author I might take up and read on the matters. I never quite understood how so many people came to such contrasting views when seeming to start from the same place. My assumption was either they all agree more than I recognize or potentially they were less capable of being understood than is often set forward. Yet, these systems provide a helpful answer.<br /><br />There truly is a continental divide, two people can land in slightly different locations on one particular issue... the one ends up at the Atlantic Ocean & the other at the Pacific. Merkle uses 4 such questions to outline his overview of these several systems. The illustration he uses of the bar chart is extremely helpful in visualizing these different systems. I also great appreciate that he acknowledges and accurately quotes several upon several individuals involved in the discussion. He attempts to keep his tongue out of the debate as best he can. As he acknowledges, someone has to be right and the other wrong... or at minimum someone is partially right and could learn from the others & vice versa.",5.0,1,2021
I loved the IDEA of this book BUT......,"So much potential, but ultimately unsatisfying.

Common Knowledge,"First 200 pages or about half the book is the author talking about how great the book will be and how amazing you will feel when done reading. If you tear out the first half of the book you miss NOTHING. Second half of the book is chalked full of common knowledge and simple ideas you can read on common blogs (meditation is good for you, eat a healthy diet, exercise, listen to music while studying). There were literally zero new ideas in this book.<br /><br />I don't read a ton of non-fiction for this exact reason - most authors have 2-3 good points and they fill up pages to create content since few people will pay for a 600-word essay. Now I must say, if you are a junior highschool student or a person with extremely low IQ, this book would be a great starting place.<br /><br />The biggest red flag is any time an author spends several chapters ""selling"" you on how great their book will be, you know it's going to be bad. Mr. Kwik also humbly brags in every chapter about the tremendous success of his company and the incredible results of the famous people he has worked with. I almost felt embarrassed for him with all the name-dropping, although I'm happy a Hollywood celebrity was able to memorize their lines because Mr Kwik told them to meditate for 10 min.

Red Island House,"*This book was received as an advanced reader's copy from NetGalley.<br /><br />Red Island House is one of the more unusual books I've read this year.  Not in the sense of dystopia, invention, or paranormal; but rather, that it takes you to a setting that is not one that I've encountered in a lot of books.  It takes you to Madagascar, by way of an unusual set of characters.<br /><br />Shay is a professor from America who falls in love with an Italian several years her senior.  Wealthy, when she meets him he is in the middle of building his dream house on some property in Madagascar, and she soon finds herself the lady of the house.  This causes internal conflict, and outward conflict as Shay herself is African American and has to adjust with interacting with the people of color around her, but from a standpoint that she views as almost colonial or hearkening back to plantations.  This confusion, combined with a tumultuous relationship, gives her a unique story across this backdrop that spans decades.<br /><br />I had a hard time relating with Shay.  An independent, intelligent woman in the beginning, I won't say that she loses that sense; but with the troubles in her marriage I do wonder at her interactions.  Maybe it's the globe-setter type of culture that comes with her marriage being in Italy and the vacationing in other places that takes it out of context for me.  But, and this will be a spoiler, I just can't see her as a character that would accept infidelity. And yet she does, so many times through this book.  Senna, her husband, I'm never fond of, but I'm not attracted to the brash type of which he is.  But really, this is Shay's story, not Senna's, so he's more of an afterthought anyway.  There are plenty  of other characters; some likable, some comedic, some with stories that take Shay out of her comfort zone, and they're all pretty important to the story in their own way, even if you don't take a liking to them.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the plot and the meandering it sometimes took; the timeline was a bit rougher for me.  We meandered over the first few years of their marriage and then wham, 5 years later, wham, 10 years later; I would have liked to not have as large of gaps and a more cohesive storyline.  I think all of the themes were important; Shay's struggle with identity and how she should act on the island, the various trials and tribulations, the uncomfort and acceptableness of the sex-work on the island (which no doubt reflects a lot of tourist areas in the world with the need for money causing people to enter a line of work they might not have otherwise).<br /><br />Overall, for me this book was important in its message, but I wouldn't call it enjoyable.  The characters' struggles and joys caused a lot of empathy, but it was a hard read.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2020",3.0,0,2021
Tedious start and finish,"My gawd it took me forever to finally see this thing through but I did it! I just really love the idea of orcs being a romantic option and the plot is interesting. I am notorious for not finishing a book for the pettiest of reasons so I’m really surprised I finished this at all.<br />This author uses the same plot device in almost all of these stories and it is really getting old. A heroine that is quick to judge and stick to her own bias for like 80% of the story. An orc that is slyer than sly and tells the truth in a round about way that always misleads the heroine into jumping to her own conclusions and thinking the worst. I honestly don’t know why I stuck this out. I hated both characters. John wasn’t likable and I already forgot the heroine’s name and that’s never a good sign lol! She is truly convinced that her benefactor, a man of high standing and has kept her as a pet of sorts since she was like 14 eww, will make her into a scholar if she can find a loophole or something new that can incriminate the orcs and reinstate the orc wars. Like what a lazy sleazeball. And I just thought she was so incredibly stupid. She’s supposed to be incredibly intelligent and resourceful which she is, but still so incredibly naive and blinded by her desire that she doesn’t see this man for who he really is a true monster. Anyway John probably deserves a better heroine but he loves her brains 🧠 so she’s the one for him.<br />Still a really good series but this one, oh boy was so tedious to get through.",3.0,0,2021
Hard to get past a few issues,"I thought An Oxford Murder was an entertaining story, but goodness it was hard to ignore the editing problems. I'm an American reader and even I noticed the writing is full of anachronistic American usages and phrases, including modern American ones! Then there is the incorrect usage of British and period words that the reader will stumble over. Finally, the general stiltedness of speech throughout. Is that supposed to make it period? Surprisingly, despite this, I liked the mystery and the characters. It's no Dorothy L Sayers, but I'll try another and hope the author finds an editor that knows the period and locale a little better.",2.0,0,2021
"Lots of character, but honestly not a lot of progress","I posted once on Daniel's blog noting that his stories tend to progress very slowly.  He pointed out that he looked at his stories as slightly ""slice of life"" and that he did not plan on changing his style.  In the books I've read since that time, that has been apparent.  He writes stories that usually have very good characters and that are woven with rather intricate plots.  It makes his tales fun to read when you like the characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that also means that the stories move slowly.  This 4th book in the Aether Reborn series is a perfect example of that.  Book 3 ended just after the midyear tournament that represented the halfway point in Gregory's second year as a student.  And while we might hope for book 4 to get to the end of the year, it actually doesn't get that far.  It does end when Gregory and his family leave the academy to travel to the planned expo/demonstration with the Empire's neighboring nation of Buldoun.<br /><br />So its a lot of pages, and yet doesn't cover quite as much time as some readers will prefer.<br /><br />Yet for all that its a very good book and for those willing to forgive the slow progress its worth the time to read.  I really enjoyed learning what was happening with Gregory, Yukiko, Jenn and their growing circle of friends.  The power that Greg will one day have continued to be hinted at, even as he gained in confidence and skill in many ways.<br /><br />If you love slow and clearly epic series written by someone who actually cares about his characters, this is a very good choice.  It has been rewarding to read.  But be prepared for a slowly progressing tale.",4.0,1,2021
The one James Herriot book I hadn't read,"I recently read James Wight""s biography of his dad, Alf Wight aka James Herriot. I found this book and realized I had not read it. Every Living Thing is as delightful as the other  4 books. The best parts were centered on Calum  Buchanan, the vet wit' the badger. This bit fascinated me because I thought badgers were fierce and aggressive animals. I doubted the would make decent pets. If Calum indeed had a badger, then I am wrong!<br /><br />This book is pivotal in seeing the transition from treating farm livestock to small animals, primarily pets. Spaying and neutering dogs and cats eventually outweighed calving and lambing.<br /><br />It's a charming book and you'll fall in love with the  Yorkshire Dales again.",5.0,1,2021

He spent a year prepping to take Bunny but idk that just felt like forever but maybe he was waiting for the house to be built?

Spoilers,"I enjoyed the first quarter of the book well enough.  The writing is cute and clever, and it got a few giggles out of me, although I'm not crazy about how the mythological references are handled, it comes off very elementary/middle grade. At 81% I've decided to finally put it down because it's just been going downhill, and I'm pretty sure there's no recovering at this point.<br />At first it was just slightly annoying that the main character, who's so fiery, and strong willed, and ridiculously powerful, doesn't put up much of a fight about being kidnapped. Yeah she argues, and scraps, but she always gives up so easy and never really commits to arguing the point that they kidnapped her. All her abductors have to do is say that they're nice, and she's going to like the new life their FORCING her into and she just sort of gives up and starts being friendly because they're just such great guys.<br />The conflict between the main character and the love interest was at least entertaining for a while but it turned instalovey real quick. She did continuously deny him and reject his advances, but as soon as she gave him an inch he went for a freaking mile and he's constantly touching and kissing and grinding on her, infront of everyone, even when she keeps telling him to stop, and that she can't be with someone who's holding her against her will. Once they get to the Palace it gets even worse. They make a big thing of showing him and his family being picture perfect and he's such a sweet guy, but he continues to push her when she doesn't want to, almost IMMEDIATELY goes against the conditions she set forth for agreeing to help him with her powers (which she never calls him out on despite the fact that it's for HER safety), and to make it even more annoying he starts getting possessive. To the point that he doesn't even want her friends, who are his friends and all part of the core team, to even hug her, gets angry because three of them are in the same room together without him. It's overplayed, and just plain gross, but despite it all she keeps liking him.<br />Then, after pushing, and pushing, and needling her incessantly, forcing her to stay in his room, accosting her infront of his family, telling her she was made for him, and she'll come around eventually, she finally gives in and sleeps with him and after that it gets REALLY boring.<br />They're lovey dovey, everyone knows they've gotten together, the kingdom is at harmony and they're getting ready to hold a dinner party. Woo. I know there's going to be more conflict coming up but honestly, if I'm following the love story of these two then I don't really care what comes next because nothing is going to pull this story out of the slump for me. Their relationship is infuriating, she's a pushover, unless there's fighting in which case she's crazy over powered, he's a d-bag (and not in a hot way), and whenever things get hairy she just uses her crazy strong magic, or gets help from one of the Gods.",2.0,0,2021

Pros and Cons,"According to his bio, the author is a highly decorated, retired military man.  I thank him for his service and applaud his desire to write, but he needs to refine his craft.<br /><br />As the book started, it seemed the author was determined to write a novel but didn't have a plot direction.  We met many characters with intricate physical descriptions, histories, backgrounds, and experiences.  We tried to remember all that, thinking it was significant - only to have the characters killed off a few pages later.  As the book progressed, the plot seemed overly convoluted, implausible, and a veritable mish-mash of every spy thriller ever written.  It wasn't until the 8th chapter that we actually met the title character.  I felt she was one-dimensional, determined but not particularly smart, and relatively unappealing.<br /><br />The book desperately needs a good copy editor.  After more than 50 errors - grammatical mistakes, misused words, mangled sentence structures, verb tense changes, poor research (there are no coyotes in Germany), and so on - I stopped counting.",3.0,0,2021

I had been looking forward to a conclusion to the story but instead found a rather typical “sad Ireland during the Troubles” tale that could have been written by anyone. Apart from adding a few character updates and a rather banal “last sister”, this was a serious letdown when I was expecting fireworks or at least some really interesting explanations. I’m sure I’ll slog through the “real” last book in OCTOBER 2022!

Dragon's Blade - could not finish,"I loved Ascendant.  I was looking forward to  reading this series and then it went all downhill.  I never connected with any of the characters.  There was some distance between me, the reader, and all the characters.  When a character was killed, I felt nothing, except to wonder what the point of the death was.  I started highlighting the things that made no sense (in one scene, the very powerful dragon blade loses 2 rubies onto the ground!  REALLY?)  Friendships were weak; trust was lacking; secrets for no reason were everywhere.  I skipped pages of the book - especially when a group is in the war room talking strategy which was just too much and I didn't care. I did not like book 1 but got through it.  Started book 2 and could not find one thing to like about it.  Lots of fighting and death and confusion and just dumb things (like one character under guard slipping away to be alone and no one knew).  So very disappointed!!!  Perhaps Ascendant book 2 will be good; perhaps the author is getting better - because I did enjoy Ascendant!!!  and wrote the author personally to tell him even though I left a review.  This series was no worth my time.  I am sorry to say.",1.0,0,2021

My Go To Resource,"This is exactly the type of book I was looking for. The recipes are great. My kids have been eating them (other than the soups but they're a hard sell on soups in general/not the fault of the cookbook).<br /><br />I love that she tells you how to freeze and pack. I often do bulk cooking for the freezer specifically for this reason. I refer to this book almost weekly to get new ideas or be reminded of a previous fav. If I don't make the exact recipe, it at least gives me ideas for new items to pack.<br /><br />So far we've tried:<br />- Chicken Salad Pinwheels<br />- Garden Party Quesadillas<br />- Club Sandwich Skewers<br />- Pizza Paninis<br />- Homemade Cracker Stackers Lunchable<br />- Breakfast for Lunch Brunchables Copycat<br />- The Creamiest, Dreamiest Broccoli Cheese Soup<br />- Winter Blues Buster Creamy Potato Soup<br />- Easy Prep Creamy Tuscan Bean Soup<br />- Sloppy Joe Bites<br />- Carnival Copycat Corn Dogs<br />- Grilled Cheese Dunkers<br />- Broccoli Pesto Pasta Salad<br />- Savory Garlic Bread Muffins<br /><br />All of the above have been good recipes. My kids especially are huge fans of the Savory Garlic Bread Muffins. I actually just made the broccoli pesto last week and used it to top pizzas with sausage and mozzarella.<br /><br />I've got the gummy bears on the list for this upcoming week. I'm also going to do a sandwich skewer since I saw it in the book.<br /><br />I appreciate that recipes are gluten-free and can easily be made nut and or dairy-free as needed. I know some folks complained about having to buy special ingredients. I keep a mostly gluten free pantry but did special order the Namaste GF Flour Blend. It's been great and I'm glad I tried it. So far my fav item out of the book has been the garlic bread muffin (reminds me of pan de queso) and I often make a 3x batch and freeze as side dishes for our dinners.",5.0,1,2021

Ms. Monroe knows exactly how to spin a tale,"This book needs content warnings for sexual assault and harm/self harm (I don't want to spoil it, so I can't give more specific warnings than that), however Ms. Monroe knows exactly how to spin a tale that is like sitting around the kitchen table listening to ladies gossiping and telling the town's business. Mr & Mrs Wiggins aren't your typical couple, and the way they've constructed their lives is so unconventional, but it works for them. Until it doesn't. And the way the Mrs. works that out? WAYULL you gonna have to read it, but you will never guess.<br /><br />Fabulous read. My only nit is the abrupt end. I felt as though there was some fatigue with the story and the outcome was just... there.  Caveat:  I complain about the end of 90% of novels I read.",4.0,1,2021
Written by Robotic Software?,"Like other reviewers, I have to wonder whether this thriller, THE OLD MAN, was actually written by Thomas Perry.  True, it is a characteristic “pursuit” novel, in which relentless killers follow a main character who barely stays alive--repeatedly--through superior intelligence, planning, and cunning.<br /><br />But unlike the other Perry novels that I’ve read (the Butcher’s Boy series, the Jane Whitefield series, and various standalones), this novel follows the “pursuit” formula so mechanically that it seems to have been written by artificial intelligence.  The main character is a cardboard cutout, and the prose is totally devoid of any style or grace.  The plot is, well, the story of a good guy (and his dogs), being pursued by a bunch of bad guys.<br /><br />If the book didn’t have Thomas Perry’s name on it, I would place the author as an aspiring fiction writer, one who is literate but unimaginative, who lacks real storytelling ability.  If Thomas Perry really did write THE OLD MAN, then he phoned it in, presumably to satisfy a contract deadline.  Or maybe it was something that Perry wrote long before he became a best-selling thriller writer.<br /><br />I abandoned THE OLD MAN about one-third of the way in, except to check the ending to see what other reviewers disliked so much.  It felt like I was reading a book authored by a robot, and it just wasn’t worth my time to finish it.  The current Kindle price ($1.99) is at least $1.00 too much.",1.0,0,2021
Difference between the reviews and reality,"I read the reviews, which is why I decided to read the book.  I haven't read anything by Parker or Timms, at least not recently, but I really was surprised at how shallow this book was.  The character development stopped at having brushed the surface. ""Uncle Sammy"" was a ridiculous spoiled rich boy but that's all. There wasn't enough work on his character to tell you much about him. The we had Declan and Alex. He meets her once, its instalove and he's jerking off in the shower.  Sorry, I wanted more about him, more development.<br /><br />I also wanted MORE STORY. I wanted it to NOT sound like it was being recited. I want to read emotions. I don't want to hear ""yes, this has really got me down"". I want to SEE 'yes, this has really got me down"".  When Alex goes to the bank, Dan shows more emotion than she does. She's fighting not to look at the floor? Really? She's fighting for her business and she comes into the bank ill-prepared with some dumb plan when she's 3 payments behind? Way too immature.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars just for the delivery. I'm sure the authors can do better. Give me a mature, thoughtful, woman, not a girl, and write her with emotion. And then do the same with the man, then you'll have my interest (and my stars).",2.0,0,2021

It's a fresh start for her.<br />Jess is the local sheriff, born and raised in town. What do they have in common? Ben... Emma met Ben, an elderly man through her duties as a nurse. They befriended one another and Ben became part of her and Rowen's family. Jess was befriended by Ben when he was a young boy. His father gone and mother ""not quite there"" Jess was basically raising himself. Ben taught him about life, took him under his wing.<br /><br />Ben has passed away, leaving his farmhouse to Gigi. She and Jess don't start off well but eventually work their way through it. Jess is definitely an Alpha male but Gigi will put him in his place if needed. I loved seeing them grow as a couple both needing to get to know one another. This story just pulled me in and I didn't want to stop reading. The characters really were everyday people.<br /><br />Then there is the mystery. Drugs have become an issue in this small town and Jess is determined to solve the mystery.

"Fun, creative, and beautifully written",Once I sat down and started reading in this book I couldn't stop until I was finished.  All of the characters and settings in the world are beautifully written and it's very easy to imagine them.  I think my favorite character is Syzygy as he reminds me of just about every D&D character I've ever played.

This book has everything.,"I was charmed by the repartee of how Diana and Finn met, by her millennial plans for marriage, kids, career. I was super interested in the verisimilitude of the rock star who’d been violently killed and his well-known Asian wife who was about to auction off a Toulouse-Lautrec and how Diana was a lowly intern at Sotheby’s who snagged the potential sale. And then, the pandemic strikes and her plans to vacation in the Galapagos with Finn, who is a resident, go awry. She ends up going alone as he works day and night at the hospital back in New York City. However, the island is essentially closed when she arrives, wifi is basically non-existent, and her luggage has been lost. Yet, she decides to stay instead or reboarding the last boat back to the main island. Diana meets some interesting locals, a teenage Beatriz, her father, and her grandmother. She learns how to barter, how to communicate in a language she doesn’t speak, and how to survive without all the baggage (literally) of the 1st world. The out-island is magical: volcanoes, lava tubes, sea lions, tortoises, poison apples. Diana discovers Beatriz is cutting herself, and soon discovers much more about Beatriz, her dad, her own very famous mother who now has dementia.  Gabriel is a former tourist guide, now farmer and shows the island to Diana. The reader thinks she knows where all this is heading until she is blindsided. I can’t say much more without revealing too much, but I will say that very rarely does a book actually make me cry. Not just get teary-eyed, but full out cry. It’s a book with tremendous power about how art can move each of us, how our realities are transformational, and how love can never be an obligation.",5.0,1,2021

The ending completely ruined this book for me,"If the ending would've been better, this book would've been four stars. However, all I am is angry right now. If you don't want a spoiler, then stop reading. No, really.<br /><br />Okay, you've been warned--having Tony's father die a matter of days before he arrives was lazy and denied us all the closure of him confronting his father. It also brushed over the effect of his death on his mother/sisters and his relationship with his stepmother. It was as if the author thought it would be too difficult and decided to avoid it.<br /><br />Not only that, but the epilogue wasn't that satisfying, either. It would've helped to show the birth of their child and how it affected Tony, given his longstanding vow to never have children. Again, super lazy.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. Up until the last few chapters, I had fully expected to keep reading this series. However, now I'm not sure I will. If we get denied the closings we need and the characters never really resolve their issues, it's not worth however many hours of my time.

I wanted to like this so badly.,"It started off really good for the first little bit while in the MCs home town. The descriptions of the world were great and the writing was great. Then it fell apart. The MC is just so ridiculously weak and insecure as a MC it is just insufferable. He never really seams to develop as a character and has absolutely no agency in the story whatsoever. He is literally drug from one set to another and sometimes just told to stand there and does. He spends much of his time rocking back and forth moaning when he is stressed. It seems like the author took ideas from autism and used that to make his character different. It just does not work well.<br /><br />Then you have the inconsistencies of characters. No attempt was ever made to escape the bad guy who murdered, burned and enslaved their home town. Who would trust someone who knew for years your friend was being tortured and never said a word...<br /><br />I wanted to like this book but 33% in and I find myself struggling to continue.

Open Your Mind,"Elizabeth's book is for those with an open mind who are seeking a higher truth as to how we got here. I have been awake, searching, learning, healing, journeying for 52 of my 62 years of life but still trying to find that connection with my galactic family. I've always lived outside the norm, created my own life, not the life we're taught to live. I've watched EA's videos for a couple years now and enjoy when she shares about our galactic family. She is real and genuine,(but I wish she didn't use the f word a lot), and her information doesn't come from anyone but herself, which is why I really like her. I highly recommend this book. Even though the info in it is mostly what I already know,  I bought it to support her because her soul is good and I believe in what she's doing. As much as I've healed in my own journey, even though I can sense their existence, I still have a hard time directly connecting to my galactic family, which is why I watch EA, hoping that something she shares will trigger my path to connection with my galactic family.<br />Please check out her book.

Having trouble with this book...,The world is not very believable.<br />First humans being addicted to leveling were it is an all consuming drug makes no sense whatsoever. There is no way a species with that issue could have ever developed a society in any way shape or form. They would be the equivalent of mindless monsters and most likely eradicate themselves. So I can't buy that premise at all.<br /><br />Second the main character while from another world seems not to care that the elves he moves in with have participated in the genocide of his species In this world. He also seems to take the elves at their word that it's the humans fault.<br /><br />Who would really want to hang out with a group of people who killed off an entire species especially when it's your own?<br /><br />The dialog is rough. There are scenes when the characters give speeches in impromptu scenarios that come off as preachy and seriously no one talks like this at all.<br /><br />These are only some of the major flaws. There are plenty of other minor issues.<br /><br />Overall this story and world range between mediocre and entirely unbelievable. I would not recommend this unless you are really hard up for something to read.,2.0,0,2021
Pretty good story but poor editing,Nice cozy mystery with some original ideas. The author needs a much better editor -- there are far too many grammar and usage mistakes. It's a fun read if you can let go of the idea of a professional presentation.,4.0,1,2021
Disappointing for the most part.,"One star because there was potential with regard to the originality of the plot. The descriptive parts of the story were well written but became repetitive after a certain point. Unfortunately, the progression of the story/action was completely unrealistic and felt rushed. This book could have easily made for an interesting saga had more time and effort been invested. It would have also been nice to have a dual POV rather than just the heroine’s POV. Her inner monologue was boring, unoriginal and also the reason I lost interest in the book about 75% in (I skimmed after that to see if there was anything redeemable-there wasn’t). To give you an idea of what I mean: the heroine thinks the hero is going to break up with her because he buys her a long sleeved blouse and requests she wears it for an evening out. I’m not kidding. She has this whole internal dialogue where she catastrophizes about what this newly gifted get-up means for her relationship with the hero. I couldn’t take the heroine seriously after that.<br />So to sum: do I think this book is worth a read? Eh. There are far better books out there—ironically many of which have been given lesser ratings than this one. Go figure.",1.0,0,2021
Boring with very little substance,"The book started out ok, kept my interest for a few chapters. But there were long stretches of dialog that was meaningless and inane; it seemed like it was added to extend the book's length. It added absolutely nothing to the storyline and I found myself skipping pages, then skipping through chapters. The end was very abrupt, and when it said ""The End"" I was truly happy - to see I was done. I have never read this author before, and think her writing is basically good, but too much added filler that added nothing to the story and bored me to tears. Deleted book and won't read this author again.",2.0,0,2021
Fantastic!,"Great pace, super writing style with no extra words or needless fluff. I read this book because I met Winning Colors as I was her Night-Watchman in Lexington, KY at the yearlong sales where her was being sold. She was huge and muscular. She had extremely intelligent eyes. They this me not to go into her stall because she bites/kicks. I had to go halfway in to right her blanket because it was getting tangled around her legs. I said a prayer and opened the stall door. Her rear (all muscle!) was facing me. Speaking to her so she knew I was there, I started reaching for the twisted blanket. Upon hearing my voice, she turned her head full around to look at me. I maintained eye contact with her the entire time I did my best to fix her blanket. It seemed she knew I was helping...or she was just curious. Her ears remained forward and inquisitive. The man (owner?) to whom I reported in the morning was upset and incredulous that I went in. I told him i needed to make sure the blanket didn't get wrapped around her legs. I was alive, so he dropped it. I owned a horse of my own so I knew a little bit, but I was young and...well...let's just day I wanted her to be safe. This book wss so well written. I cheered and re-read some parts because they were so exciting. Great characters in the story too. Loved it. What a book!",5.0,1,2021
Impressive as long as you have no phobias against spiders.,"Impressive as long as you have no phobias against spiders.<br /><br />I have often thought of plot lines involving sentient male insectnoids and arachnoids with female Earthers. Lots of ideas but never placed them on paper. So when I saw Ensnared on Amazon, I had to buy it.<br /><br />Some of the reviews say Ensnared isn't a romance novel. It is, but it is a slow-burner.<br /><br />Ketahn is a male weaver/now hunter for his people, the Vrix. The Vrix are arachnoids, the males with six legs and four arms while the females only have four legs and four arms. There's serious sexual dimorphism involved in that the females are seriously taller and larger (9-10 feet tall) than the males (7.5-8 feet tall). The female Vrix are the warrior leaders and serious fighters. The males, while fighters themselves when in battle, are usually hunters, miners, quarry folk, healers, etc. The Vrix females lay many eggs which, when hatched, are brood-siblings to each other. There is a sire and a dam, and the relationships between them all can be very close. As for Ketahn, all but he and his warrior sister Ahnset, who is one of the Queen Zurvashi's personal bodyguards — the Queen's Fang — are the only survivors. Queen Zurvashi wants Ketahn to sire her next brood as she considers. him the only one worthy enough, but he refuses as he cannot stand her cruel ways despite the advantages. So he banishes himself into the Tangle — the vast jungle of his world — to provide meat for the inhabitants of Takarahl, the stronghold of his people.<br /><br />Ivy Foster, on the other hand, is a Human who is part of a Human colonization project on another planet. For reasons unknown, the colony ship crashes on Ketahn's planet, and by accident, Ketahn falls into the humungous pit created by such a crash and stumbles across Ivy's cryopod. He inadvertently releases her and takes her to his nest. From that point on, it's a day-in-the-life of a Vrix and a Human. Like I said, the relationship is a slow-burner but not that slow.<br /><br />I found this novel to be far better written than many I have recently read. I enjoyed the world-crafting done by Tiffany Roberts. A lot of thought went into this planet's creation, including its own mythos and legends. Much time was spent in this world's development of its own fauna and flora. By the time I finished reading Ensnared, I knew exactly what Ketahn and Ivy looked like, what the Vrix looked like (without having to refer to the front cover art!), and a rough idea of the Tangle and its various beautiful locations.<br /><br />I was extremely sympathetic to the main character Ketahn and Ivy, but I also appreciated the time and effort spent developing Ketahn's friends and family within Takarahl, and I hope we get a chance to see more of them in the next two books! I didn't find much in terms of continuity issues. I was able to continuously suspend my disbelief (which is essential in a tale like this), and the writing and its style were excellent though not necessarily perfect. (But face it! Not even Tolkien was perfect!)<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to the rest of this interesting trilogy. In fact, I have already pre-purchased the next two books — Enthralled and Bound — which are to be published in the next few years.<br /><br />Yes, I know some people might consider the ending of Ensnared to be a cliffhanger. Believe me, I've read worse and more frustrating cliffhangers than this one. But considering how long this book has been already, I doubt I could justify the recommendation to compressing the next two titles into one big book. Too much info, too much action. I could even see the resurrection of the others still in suspended sleep in future tales, but we have yet to deal with Queen Zurvashi and why so many of the Vrix in Takarahl are starving of meat deficiency. So much to know still... So much to know...<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any who are hard-core monster lovers... except those with spider phobias. Nope. Those with arachnophobia are recommended to steer clear from this trilogy. Excellent writing, Tiffany Roberts!",5.0,1,2021

So disappointed in this author...,"There are no words for how disappointed I am in this author. She has been one of my favorites for a while. Her heroes are usually great (with the exception of Emmet, who was a faithless manw***re). She’s been introducing us to Dare for years with the FU series, and we realized what an amazing guy he is. I hate reading trilogies, but I trusted her so I chanced this read. Now I wish I hadn’t. This was a second chance story yes. They knew each in high school and separated for 4 years. Now we find out that the heroine completely abandons him after everything he has done, but for them to be apart another SIX YEARS!!!!!! I typically hate second chances, but I gave this a try anyway. Dare seemed so broken over this girl, that I just had to , and since I trusted the author... But I didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t sign up for a third chance story. My biggest complaint over Maya is that in her second chance stories the characters typically sleep around. So there is about a .0001 % chance that she will have them be faithful and loyal to each other for the next six years.  And this is supposed to be a love story. Yeah... Right... Why would o think that is romantic? Why would I want to read this? What a waste of my time and money. I truly expected more from this author, she’s broken my trust and I’ll never rush to one of her books again.",1.0,0,2021
Where are the directions to use the Chicken Gravy mix???,"Very disappointed.  I bought this ""cookbook"" primarily for the Chicken Gravy mix, and while I now know that the mix recipe will make 2 2/3 cups of gravy mix, nowhere does it say how to turn the mix into gravy, or how many servings it will yield.  And the pudding mix recipe says ""vanilla"" but does not indicate whether the amount is for extract or flavoring.  It should include both options, especially since there are other flavorings available that people might want to try.  Sadly, the pudding mix was my secondary reason to buy this.<br /><br />Giving it two stars because of the hot chocolate and potato soup mixes, which are complete.

Thrilled,"Peter Heller wrote a darn good thriller that kept me guessing until about three-quarters of the way through. Jack, a young rancher, in Colorado is healing -still- from the guilt of seeing his mother and horse lose footing on the mountain and him, as a teenager, being unable to save her. Then again, he lost his best friend, literally, on a fishing trip. He’s now working at an uber exclusive fishing lodge where the well-heeled come to rejuvenate in solitude. Only all is not what it seems. What happened to the guide Jack is filling in for?  Why all the strict rules about neighboring  properties and getting shot or mauled by dogs if you cross the line? And why do the guests seem so strangely out of it?  Throw in a slightly older country music star who’s Jack's fishing responsibility, some locked gates, a strange code…well, get on with it.

"I'm speechless, it was that good","First, to the one star reviewer who said the author never revealed who the man in the shop was. Of course she did, and it was part of what made the ending so much better.<br /><br />I just read this for the first time today. I purchased this book four years ago, but it sat on my Kindle because in my mind, I love Sandra Brown but not as an author of historicals.  I can remember reading the Grapes of Wrath and having my parents, who were married and lived through that time (I was a late baby) telling me that the book was so very true to life. That the government failed as many people as the stock market and weather did. I have spoken to friends of my grandparents who were trying to raise their kids in the early 1934 and 1935.  So I began reading the book knowing a lot about a time I didn't live in. Sandra Brown didn't either but she sure knows how to bring it to life.<br /><br />Through half of the book I was smiling and the other half I was crying. I hope she writes more from this time period because nothing missed her keyboard - not the despair, the loneliness, the racism, the hatred, the hopelessness of those days. But she also captured the love, the caring.  I loved Rainwater himself and Ella was an interesting woman, and very much cut from the fabric of those times.<br /><br />I suspect the one and two star reviews are because people didn't understand that time. It wasn't a case of 'why don't they just give the cows to the people who needed them' before the government could shoot them', it was because the program that paid them for those dead cows was the only way they survived. The ONLY way.<br /><br />Just a story from 1934. My parents lived in a house they owned and my father stayed working that entire decade. My mother raised chickens, and yes to his dying day, my father really wasn't a fan of chickens. Their house wasn't too far from the railroad tracks and my mother would feed the hobos. I asked her once why she wasn't afraid, she told me that those men were so downtrodden that a simple thing like a meal made them feel better about themselves. And the chickens? Because the family next door to them were nearly starving, she would ""accidentally"" chop the heads off two chickens instead of one, and take the spare to the neighbors.  So yes, Sandra Brown really did get it.",5.0,1,2021
Is this a book ?,"A person owning a book store in a small town has 2 employees.

Wouldn’t recommend,"I could even finish it. I have a few chapters a try, really wanting this book to be good. It wasn’t. It was downright awful. No emotional depth in the characters. Everything is told to you. “I put clothes in the closet” “I felt sad” “The smoke was hot”. Come on… The dialogue was awkward. The first chapter had no transition inbetween events. She’s “arguing” with her mom about a party, states she thinks she’s acting weird, they pull up to the party, bam her mom is on the phone in a scuffle, bam she’s back at home, bam her house is on fire, bam she’s at the academy and just accepts that supernatural people exist no questions asked, bam she’s enrolled, and there’s no emotion from her whatsoever that her mother is missing. When she tells another character her mother was kidnapped and house burned down that character’s reaction is verbatim “that sucks”. Absolutely terrible.",1.0,0,2021
A book my grandson might actually read,"One of the frustrations of my life as a grandfather is that my grandson has never been interested in reading the books I found compelling at his age. This one, however, may be an exception. I won't know for sure until it arrives for his upcoming birthday, but I certainly found it worth reading myself, even though I've already read almost everything ever written by this author.<br /><br />The key feature is its pithiness. Each of the 89 chapters is brief and to the point, but still includes not only a piece of advice, but enough explanation to show its value in real life, for a teenager. I found myself underlining something in almost every chapter.<br /><br />Part of the value is that the advice isn't coming from any of my grandson's relatives. I remember having trouble learning anything from my own parents or grandfather at that age, and also remember my son having the same problem when he was that age. All part of growing up, I expect.<br /><br />Once the book arrives and has been gifted, I'll update with whether anyone but me was willing to read it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, highly recommended for any teen in your life who currently think their life sucks.",5.0,1,2021
Do not forget to read the end notes!,"This is a very timely, interesting, and concerning book.  But as I read every chapter, I found myself wondering why or how about much of the information presented.  It was as though much of the book was missing and that distracted from the value of the information.  What I realized after finishing the book that I should have read the end notes for a chapter immediately after reading the chapter and use the extensive end notes and references to provide the much needed additional clarity to the book.  Following up by reading and following references in the end notes makes this book truly rate 5 stars.  Well done!",5.0,1,2021
"OK, but ....","The tale is OK, but: while the action (usually) keeps up at a good pace:<br />- the hero is another of those: rugged, handsome, totally indestructible and continuously lucky characters.<br />- some of the situations and actions of the hero will have you laughing aloud at the incongruities.<br />- the ending is just silly and inconclusive - seems like the author just gave up dreaming up yet more implausible situations and stopped writing ...<br />... you could just suspend your grasp on reality and go along for the ride?",3.0,0,2021
"Predictable, emotional rollercoaster read","Jocelyn comes home to help her grandmother after a fall and broken leg only to find her high school love is the live in caretaker and blacksmith on the farm. When her mother forced her to move her senior year she left her best friend and boyfriend behind with the promise to return. But Mack hadn't waited for her and never wrote, so Jocelyn moved on and tried to mend her broken heart.<br /><br />Mack was devistated when Jocelyn moved but after he didn't hear from her again he tried to move on but didn't make the best choices. Now Jocelyn has returned for two weeks to help her grandmother. Is there a chance their love could be rekindled as they work together to help save her grandmother's farm or will Jocelyn return to her fancy New York job?<br /><br />Predictable and similar to many other country romance novels with youthful misunderstandings from years ago,  Mack and Jocelyn are repeatedly about to resolve the past but there is always a ridiculous interruption. And then, not surprising, just as they begin to hash out where things went wrong there is another interuption. I got bored with this quickly. This couple goes from bursts of happy one minute to angry and hurt the next, and then back for a repeat of the same too many times for my liking. I was also disappointed that Jocelyn never got to the bottom of the missing letters.<br /><br />I received an ARC and voluntarily offer this review.",3.0,0,2021

Creepy but too long,"I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Actual Rating = 2.5 stars<br /><br />The Watchers follows a group of individuals who are trapped in an enchanted forest where it's really not a good idea to be away from shelter after dark. The Watchers, mysterious and deadly denizens of the wood, basically just stare at them all night long through a mirrored window. Super creepy, right?<br /><br />If you're looking for a book with atmosphere, this has plenty of it. The voyeuristic nature of the Watchers made me genuinely uncomfortable while reading, and the nod to Irish folklore was a cool inclusion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this suffered from a few issues that detracted from the genuinely creepy story. First, the prose was over the top. There's a fine line between descriptive detail and straight up purple prose, and this book crossed that line fairly regularly. This was a real disservice to the text, as it messed with th pacing - a vital component to any horror.<br /><br />The overwriting is also responsible for the second issue: this book is too long. Clocking in at only 240 pages, this may seem like an absurd comment. However, I really think this would've hit harder as a novella or short story, where the author could really let their ruthless worldbuilding shine without worrying about a page count",3.0,0,2021
Much more than about Romans,If I had realized gibbons's decline in fall was about more than Romans I would have read this book a long time ago. Reading it on Kindle is extremely handy. There is no need to have to have other books alongside you to look up things. Pressing on the word comes up with a definition or the meaning of terms that are ancient and strange.<br /><br />One learns an awful lot about the ancient civilizations in Germany and beast. It is not just about the Roman victories. There is a lot of detail about the people's who live in all of those areas. One begins to wonder who is the barbarian a lot of times when you see the cruelty dished out by the Romans and the all parties.,5.0,1,2021
Ends abruptly,"It started okay & interesting, then it ended so suddenly , I had to check if audible had crashed.

Mysterious and Suspenseful,"This is a slow burn clean romance. A governess with a mysterious unknown parentage background. Mercy has been the governess to two adorable little girls for five years. Their father dies and now they are orphans. Mercy will not leave their side. She loves them as if they were her own. Now they have a new guardian they have never met. The solicitor is a nasty piece of work. He is an evil gossip-monger, pretentious, prejudice b@st@rd. He purposefully cuts off all funds and leaves the children with no thought as to what they may need or eat. Mercy to the rescue. She uses her own funds to keep the household running as best she could. But it was not enough. As the new guardian had yet to make his appearance, she was going to have to sell her prized possession. On that day as she readied to leave the guardian finally shows up. He was disgusted with the solicitor for the way he treated the little girls and the household. He fired him. (I say good ridden to bad trash.) Ronan had no clue how to be a guardian especially to two little girls. He was grateful for Mercy and her deep and loving relationship with the children. Unfortunately, Ronan had no choice but to turn their lives upside down and moved them to London. Ronan was a kind man. He took care of the girl's father's debts and pensioned the cook and the butler. Mercy could not help but be impressed with Ronan even after he insulted her and felt prejudice against her for something the nasty solicitor had told him. But Mercy and Ronan for the sake of the girls kept a civil professional relationship. When they arrived in London all heck breaks loose good and bad. It was a crazy time for Mercy and Ronan vowed to stay by her side through anything she had to deal with. An excellent story that ends with beyond and above all that Mercy could ever hope and wish for.<br /><br />I received an Advanced Readers Copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review.",4.0,1,2021
Toxic,"I enjoyed this book purely for the audible narration and the accuracy of the Scotland part. Bonnie is immature and whiny, it portrays younger women in an AWFUL light. She’s toxic. But so are the other main characters. Rowan was rude, mean, and aggressive in all the wrong ways. When he went off on her in the shed? It was emotionally abusive.<br />Dakota was also extremely toxic. Their friendship was toxic. I hate that Bonnie was forced to own up for everything yet Dakota barely took accountability for anything.<br />The conflicts in the book, how they were written and “resolved” completely ruined this book for me.<br />I’d not recommend this at all.",2.0,0,2021

The perfect escape from the chaos of the season,"I really enjoyed each book in the Happy Cat series as they were individually released, and at the time, I was stomping up and down because I wanted Savannah's story. At long last, here it is--a novella added to the newly released box set. And it was so worth the wait! We finally get to meet Simon and Beatrice, and of course we officially meet Savanah, who we've heard much about throughout the series. Plus, we get to revisit our other beloved Happy Cat characters and their adorable, sometimes troublemaking, critters. Simon and Savanah's story was a delightful read, and then after devouring it, I immediately had to start back over and read the whole series. This whole series is a bundle of laughs tied together with a small string of nail-biting suspense. It's the perfect escape.",5.0,1,2021
Unanswered Questions Make For A Less Than Satisfying Read,"I’m new to stories written by Heidi McLaughlin. For the record, I’m partial to small town romance novels and since it had an Audible companion I thought I’d give this book a try. First and foremost it’s a clean romance suitable for young adults. I personally prefer stories with a little more graphic sexual content but if it’s a well written story with good character development I can easily forego that. That being said, this story was a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />On the positive side, I liked the flashbacks to the past helping readers understand the culture of Cape Harbor, strongly rooted in the fishing industry and the significance of Driftwood Inn and Carly. We learned about  the relationship of Austin and Brooklyn, it’s development, and the friendship and connection of Bowie, Austin and Brooklyn.<br /><br />The downside to this story is readers are never given critical pieces  of information that would serve to close the chapters of Bowie and Brooklyn’s  story and relationship in a more satisfying way. The  information needing to be revealed involved two imperfect yet charitable characters Carly and Austin. Since there is a Book 2 being released February second, I’m hoping this omission by the author was intentional and would be revealed in the next installment. Otherwise, I’m NOT happy! ☹️<br /><br />Brooklyn’s daughter, Brystol, was stated to be fourteen years old but her character acted and talked more like an eight year old. I liked Brooklyn and Bowie’s relationship but some of the story seemed to become too repetitive and this questioning behavior by Brooklyn on whether to stay in Cape Harbor or leave after the renovation of the Driftwood Inn became rather tiresome and caused me to have a few eye rolls at times. I mean.... seriously?<br /><br />Book 2 is supposed to give us Graham and Brooklyn’s best friend, Rennie’s story.  I’m on the fence whether to continue with the next installment. If I do, it’s only to hopefully get some answers left hanging in this book.  I have to say, I LOVED the narrator in Audible. She was more like a storyteller with a pleasant, relaxing tone. Beautifully told!",3.0,0,2021

"Seriously, how could you not want to read this? Did you see the four names on the cover?","Yea, yea...I know.<br /><br />For those of you who have been reading my reviews for any length of time at all, it's no secret that I'm a huge Jeff Strand fan. But did you know I've also been a fan of Jeff Menapace and Iain Rob Wright for years? I absolutely have. And after reading my first William Malmborg story (in this very collection), I definitely plan to check out more of his work. His storytelling ability is on point.<br /><br />I love slasher stories (of course I do - I grew up watching Jason, Michael, and Freddy), so when I heard about SLICE AND DICE, a slasher collection written by some of my favorite authors in the genre, I was more than a little stoked.<br /><br />And guys, it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Second Chance by Jeff Menapace - This is probably the most traditional of the four stories in this collection. It's an engrossing first-person perspective of a son, so desperate for a very twisted version of his father's love, he'll go to lengths that most wouldn't contemplate. Jeff writes page turners, and this story is no exception.<br /><br />The Reckoning by Iain Rob Wright - In direct contrast to Second Chance, Iain's contribution to the collection is completely nontraditional. The Reckoning is a futuristic, almost moralistic, story with a very unexpected serial killer...and some really creepy technology. This was beautifully written, and I genuinely enjoyed the premise (which was a little too plausible for comfort).<br /><br />Billy's Blade by William Malmborg - Like I mentioned above, this was the first time I've had the pleasure of reading Malmborg's work, and I'll just come out and say it...I'm a fan. This story is twisted, depraved, and totally screwed up...and I kind of loved it. This one isn't for the faint of heart. (I've had Jimmy on my Kindle for a long time...but with the never-ending ARCs I get, I've never made the time to actually read it. That's changing. And soon.)<br /><br />Twentieth Anniversary Screening by Jeff Strand - I actually read this particular story weeks ago, and I absolutely loved it. Twentieth Anniversary Screening, alone, is worth the cost of the e-book. It's creepy, twisted, crazy clever, and parts are so funny (one scene in particular...you'll know it when you read it, I promise), I had laugh-tears running down my cheeks. I guess maybe you'd call this story a mockumentary? Eh, call it whatever you want, it doesn't matter. You're gonna love it. This story was, hands down, my favorite of the bunch.<br /><br />Each of the four novellas offers something different to the slasher sub-genre and I, personally, can't recommend this collection enough.<br /><br />Available TODAY - June 1, 2021.<br />Paperback copies will be available soon.<br /><br />Many thanks to the authors of SLICE AND DICE for my review copy.",5.0,1,2021
From great start to just strange ride couldn't wait to get off of.,"This started off strong.  With strong exciting characters and I thought it would be a fun read.  Then it got weird and tedious.  Too long! It had the potential to be a great story but the strong characters became weak and boring.  The Female lead Braxton went from fiesty and strong to irritating and petty.  This author took me on many rides that I didn't want to go on but I was invested by the initial personalities and wanted her to take them back  These men were so awestruck over lust.  The story dredged on & on then on some more.  Most of intimate scenes were boring and just not that good or uncomfortable for this reader.  The 1st scene with Houston was hot otherwise the rest was just a bunch of lust filled people who didn't do it for me.  Plus Houston was such a strong character and then blah lovestruck and willing to share.  Idk he  just became boring.  They all did.  Jericho/Rich actually stayed the same as he was already boring.  I skipped and skimmed after 50 percent hoping it would get better.  Instead, it got worst time & time again.",2.0,0,2021
LLLooong fighting sequences,"OK, so my rating should tell you that I don't hate the series, but though the main heroine was a girl, the level of gore & endless fight scenes make it seem more geared towards boys.  The really long fight scenes  reminded me of all the spiderman movie fight scenes where no matter how hard you hit him or the villain, they keep getting back up. The endless  punching, hitting slicing & dicing was just tedious, ridiculous &  boring. The heroine was cringy. She's an assassin who won't kill. That makes her a good person & a good hero but  stretches credulity in actually still being in the school as a student. Her crush on Thord was elementary school-ish.  You will notice that no one really needed food or sleep in this book. They mention it, but don't actually do much of it, even after almost dying (over & over & over again). It's never suggested that magic sustains them when it came to stamina & starvation.Happily, if you are one of the lucky main 4 characters, you can get stabbed, loose a body part, go without sleep & fight on just fumes for days on end-just because you have to & you will live.<br />If I had to describe this book in one word I'd say : exhausting- and advise you to skip the fight scenes it ends up as excessive violence with the outcome already figured out.<br />Lastly ;It could have done with tighter editing.<br />Note to author:<br /> Calvary is NOT the same as Cavalry !! a book so battle centric should have the right word :P",4.0,1,2021
The First Wife's Secret,I didn't expect to like this story. Because I am a romantic at heart. But this was a family in crisis that drew me in.

Exceptional and Wildly Entertaining,"In a word, this is one exceptional novel, a really fun, really exciting, really interesting story, really well-written by a guy who obviously knows way more about what he tells us than he is telling us. I learned several new words, which is a joy. It is expert, professional, and authentic in so many ways. The characters are engaging and genuine in everything they do and everything they say, and you’ll really hate the bad guys. Good dialogue is always a treat. I’ve never played any of those popular word/dice type of games, but everything seems realistic, like I imagine those kinds of games are played.

FOR THE LOVE OF THE LOWCOUNTRY-REMEMBERING DOTTIE FRANK,"The journey to womanhood can be lonely.  Dottie Frank filled her stories with women young & old seeking their happiness, their purpose. Her characters faced sorrow, disappointment & questioned their goals in life. Often the ladies found what they thought they wanted suddenly didn’t matter. Dottie showed many sides of the conversation.  Her stories were filled with fine dining, wine & spirits & the Lowcountry magic we all craved. How we all wished we had a beach to stroll, to watch the waves sort out our problems & the sunset to tell us tomorrow is another day. I began reading Dottie’s hilarious bestsellers while going through a major health crisis. How I wish we all could have been there for Dottie, she slipped away too young too soon.

"Lots of filler, not much substance","Let me start by saying I really enjoy Lily Atlas MC Romance, especially the Handlers (and especially Copper's story) and often overlook the glaring grammatical errors because the story is good.  I've also read a few other authors of MC Romances, and quite frankly, they're just bad, so I don't expect the writing caliber of say Nora Roberts with this genre of books.  However, this story was so filled with repetitive dialog - in the H&h's own heads - that it became ridiculous.  Also ridiculous was the absolutely unbelievable need for the h to prove her independence.  It was not only pigheaded, it was out and out stupid.  And to really make this story ridiculous, the 41 yr old h thinks she's so old she needs to wear a one piece bathing suit with a skirt!  And her constant worry that her boobs aren't as firm as when she was 20 is over the top insecure and ridiculous.  Yes, I know she was abused by her ex-husband, but after over 5 years in therapy, this woman needs alot more help - I wanted to slap her for some of her stupid thoughts and stupider actions.<br />And the H is apparently so hot looking that women throw themselves at him, and yet, after serving 13 yrs in prison w/out a whiff, he waits for this 41 yr old stupidly stubborn self-loathing twit to be ready to have sex with him.

A new series,"The story takes place in future Japan after several Global conflicts.  The setting is gritty with few sympathetic characters.  The Main Character, Tatsu, is a female ex-military Cyborg working the slums and is very similar to Nava from the Death’s Handmaiden series.  Instead of Magic we have Advanced Science.  Instead of a young super soldier, we have an old soul who was a soldier.  Both feel disconnected from humanity, both share the same deadly instincts in battle, and both are in need of human contact.  (Female, of course; this is Niall Teasdale)<br /><br />There is a lot of action, and the story flows quickly.<br /><br />Unlike the Death’s Handmaiden series, which was a bunch of novellas collected into three volumes, this is one book which is a good first book in its own series.<br /><br />The one major negative for this book is the setting is Japan and it uses MANY Japanese words that aren’t always easy to understand from the context.  An example is the word “Sachiko” which Tatsu refers to her girlfriend after a while.  It means “… a feminine Japanese given name that means ""child of bliss.”  I had to look it up to get the reference.  There are a few more.  Maybe someone steeped in Anime would get the reference, but I’m not, so not understanding why a character is saying something is annoying.<br /><br />I still enjoyed the book and will likely buy the next.",4.0,1,2021

Be prepared to dislike Brooke just a bit by the end of this book.,"This story was riveting for me at the beginning, hearing about this young girl managing to thrive with an alcoholic mother. I too am the only child of an alcoholic father and a mentally ill mother, who somewhat resembles Terry.  But as I read on into the last half of the book, I can see how much more recovery Brooke could use. Her codependency is epic and her sense of entitlement is epic as well. God forbid she makes a mistake bigger than her daughters pierced ears….and the references to her own drinking are disturbing. She is aware of the genetic disposition? You don’t have to be a falling down drunk to have an unhealthy relationship to alcohol. Brooke expects a certain behavior from everyone around her for her to be okay, from the nurses to shop keepers or her husband. I can see how affected she is. She references ACOA several times but doesn’t mention going to meetings. Well, she should. Then she could see the multitudes of people dealing with similar issues, but without the wealth and privileges Brooke has had most of her life. She doesn’t live in the real world.

A biography that will leave you in awe of this incredible woman,"With his third book detailing the lives of pop stars, Michael Francis Taylor has hit this one out of the park. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but not from the perspective of a Taylor Swift fan; from the perspective of a musician who never spent five minutes listening to her. I was Carly Simon’s guitarist for twenty-one years, and Michael Taylor did such a fine job on his book, The Music of Carly Simon, I took the leap of faith and bought his Taylor Swift book. If I could go from indifferent and disinterested about Ms. Swift to a full-blown Swiftie upon reading just the first few chapters, then you know Mr. Taylor has done his job.<br /><br />This book is so comprehensive about her life, her hits, her heartbreaks, her triumphs and her absurd popularity, you can’t walk away unimpressed after reading it. The intense detail the author goes into about the little things that moved and mattered to her, not to mention every single press review and highest chart position on every single record - well, let’s just say the research alone should get him a five-star review, but there’s so much more to it than that. I fell in love with Taylor Swift while reading this book, and I am not in my teens or twenties. I’m in my seventies!<br /><br />Michael Taylor includes all the facts - the liable aimed at her, the deceit, the dissing, the gossip, the trials and court wins, but beyond that, he describes Taylor Swift’s astonishing ability to “shake it off” and move on to what are the two most important things in her life - making great music and making her fans happy. She is obsessed and devoted. When she’s not making music, she floods charities with money. She shares her astonishing wealth in so many ways, you leave this book feeling this woman has an absolute heart of gold. She deserves every single award she has ever won, non-the-least for her mind-blowing productivity, but for her world-class empathy for human suffering and putting her checkbook way ahead of her critics and detractors, supporting so many needy causes.<br /><br />Taylor Swift: The Brightest Star is a tell-all of the best possible kind. The author tells all that is available to tell, and the all, in this case, includes the kind of happy ending we so need in these troubled times. He makes it clear that in her case, hard work, massive heart, and the energy of ten nuclear power plants all in one human being have driven this beautiful star to the highest levels of musical fame. And he makes it clear that no one deserves it more. When the Kanye’s and Kims taunted and harassed her, they only made her seem more sympathetic and them, their own worst enemies and petty detractors. Yes, when her record company sold her music out from under her, she was as sad and bitter as a dumped lover. But did she give up in a tearful surrender to her unfortunate fate? Not even close. She rose above it and just began re-recording her first six albums, the first of which debuted at #1, literally eclipsing the previous versions of her work. She now owned the re-recordings and no one could take them away from her. The greedy buyers of her previous recordings now owned a body of work, rapidly becoming worthless, that her fans wouldn’t touch with Kanye West’s gloves.  The author makes it clear that Taylor Swift is not just a brilliant composer/lyricist/singer - she is also a savvy businesswoman with an iron fist hidden inside a lace glove. It’s all in this well-researched and well-written book.<br /><br />Here’s my recommendation. If you are not a Taylor Swift fan, take the leap of faith that I did in the following way: As you read the book, have YouTube open, and as the songs and their history come up, play the video of the song. The book will come to life in a way that cannot help but steal your heart. My vote? Five stars for Michael Francis Taylor and his wonderful musical biography, Taylor Swift The Brightest Star: The Life, Loves and Music of a Global Sensation.",5.0,1,2021
Second Chance Vow,"Slightly angsty, way frustrating. This book bounces back and forth from the present to the past so we learn all about how our married couple Christian and Kinley met and fell in love and all the bumps and bruises along the way to their current situation of getting a divorce. Now Kinley is the one filing and insisting she loves Christian now and forever but they can't be together because she can't possibly give him what he so desperately needs. He is fighting the whole time. Begging her to stop the divorce because he loves her and cannot lose her. It's back and forth, I love you but no we can't, the whole time! Until the one thing that was driving them apart finally happens and then it's just all forgiven and HEA. Yeah... Kinley's refusal to get every test under the sun before she just up and threw her marriage away to her SOULMATE was so frustrating! Her husband was a successful OBGYN! And getting there he probably made friends with specialists who could have done more also but instead there was one DR. years ago who told her one thing and years later she's like nope.<br />So it's a yes and a no for me I liked the story and story line but I found some of the logistics improbable and the characters (mostly Kinley) so frustrating.",2.0,0,2021
Surprisingly insightful,"Although I'm quite a few years the authors senior, I've followed her journey... somewhat.  I actually felt some sorrow for her, seeing that she was in emotional pain. I hate to see what Hollywood does to these young, talented stars. We adore, we follow, we have unrealistic expectations and sometimes we harass them until they are not allowed to have their own lives. It shows a level of ""pathetic"" amongst the public, to become a part of this unnatural frenzy. I'm happy to see that she's working through her personal issues, and is reaching her personal goals. Kudos to Ms. Simpson, for effort and consistency. May your journey continue down this ""constructive"" pathway.",5.0,1,2021

... you will find on rereading that a great deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading,"If you reread your work, you will find on rereading that a great deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing. ~ William Safire<br /><br />Shana Granderson is an author who has only recently begun publishing and I know she has taken hits about the need for proofreading.  I am happy to report that in her most recent story, the errata is lessened a very great deal.  I appreciate the extra effort.<br /><br />The basis of this story is good:  Mr. Bennet is a duke who has married twice and has a number of children.  Darcy mistakes the name and issues his insult without realizing just whom he has maligned.  Elizabeth is the one with the implacable resentment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story could have been cut by about a third of the length by eliminating repetition of information.  We learn Darcy is embarrassed by his mistake and he vows to improve.  We see him with his relatives who tell him of his mistake and listen to his vow to improve.  We see Bingley (and even Caroline) embarrassed by the insult and they tell the Bennets of Darcy’s vow to improve.  We hear Darcy’s thoughts about his vow to improve.  We hear Elizabeth’s thoughts about her implacable resentment.  Her family and friends chastise her for her implacable resentment.  On and on and on.<br /><br />The book reads a little like a Soap Opera where the viewer can keep up with the story by seeing it only once a week or so.  Something happens; someone tells someone else what happened; someone ponders the emotional side of what happened …<br /><br />A reader can get the basic idea the first time.  A little reminder later, maybe.  But enough is enough and too much is plenty.<br /><br />I view this author as someone wanting to improve and I hope she will consider my remarks to be constructive.<br /><br />This is the first of three parts but it is a reasonable length for a published book and not a “40-page wonder book.”<br /><br />The happiness of most people is not ruined by great catastrophes or fatal errors, but by the repetition of slowly destructive little things. ~ Ernest Dimnet",3.0,0,2021
"Excellent novelty, limited usability","First of all, there's a lot to like about this book. Honestly, I'd prefer to give it 3.5 stars if Amazon allowed it. However, there are some limitations.<br /><br />To begin with, the good: The thoughtfulness of recipes and how they relate to the various geeky properties is excellent. The layout, design, and photography are also all top-notch.<br /><br />The problem comes from how useful / practical this book will actually be. Almost all of the recipes call for very uncommon ingredients that most people are not likely to have on-hand. For example, one might not be too keen to purchase melon liqueur just to make one or two cocktails from the book. Even if you do, what do you do with the remaining ingredient if you decide you don't particularly care for the cocktail after the novelty wears off?<br /><br />Also, the index is frustratingly incomplete. For example, it does an excellent job of cross referencing a number of the geeky properties throughout the book. However, far more useful would have been to include in the index all of the specialty ingredients, if for no other reason so that you can determine if that bottle of, say, the aforementioned melon liqueur, can be used in anything else.<br /><br />I feel like some might pull this from the shelves once, maybe twice a year for some themed party, where a special trip to purchase a batch of oddball ingredients isn't out of line.<br /><br />However, for most, I fear that once the initial novelty of browsing through it wears off, little use will be found other than showing it off for friends and proclaiming ""yeah, we should make these sometime."" And then promptly forgetting about it.",3.0,0,2021
Our son had special needs,"This book was recommended to me because our son had special needs. Raising a child with exceptional needs can be so costly and often if if the whole family who ends up suffering losses.  If your child has cancer they can receive  100% care at St. Judes and never receive a bill however, if your child has exceptional learning delays (unable to walk or talk), seizures, and a feeding tube - the parents are expected to cover the costs for appointments and adaptive equipment - insurance only covers certain things for example - insurance only covers 1 therapy a month.

Dancing in the Dark,"This was a second chance for two people who were ripped apart by hate. The story started out with her going back to the town that she was raised w.

But what happened when her fiance tells her that he is to be a father to her sister's child? The hurt had her life devastated. She turned to dance and became famous.

It made uncomfortable reading,"Rating: 1.5🌈<br /><br />I have enjoyed this series immensely. Which is why I’m so surprised and puzzled over the characters and storylines of The Wrangler and the Orphan , the 4th in the Farthingdale Ranch series.<br /><br />Unlike the others, this book has some major elements and characters which unfortunately didn’t work for me and in cases actually, had me thinking of cautionary flags.<br /><br />And it starts right with the main characters. And their dysfunctional backgrounds as well as current histories.<br /><br />The characters…..<br /><br />🌈Kit Foster. Abandoned teen, last enrollment and safe structure was middle school, regularly beaten as well as emotionally traumatized by his mother and her endless line<br /> of temporary “boyfriends” to the point that’s Kit’s normality.<br /><br />His mother repeatedly moves him, eliminating any support or security other than her, who again abandons him after stealing money from her latest target and taking off to Las Vegas.<br /><br />So basically, Kit is a mass of Insecurities , unable to trust, a scared kid  of scarred body and young unformed abused mind. Without even an abusive mother to hold onto, he’s desperation personified.<br /><br />Worse, Kit has just escaped ,after being severely beaten by bar owner Eddie Piggot, and imprisoned in the bar’s basement.  He’s got Victim written all over him.<br /><br />He’s rescued by Brody, the ranch’s wrangler.<br /><br />That would be…..<br /><br />🌈Brody Calhoun, almost 30. Ranch Wrangler. Son of an abusive father who whipped , beat and starved him.  Ran away with a older carny man, still suffers PTSD from his upbringing, nightmares which he treats with CBD oil. Which is fine except it would get him fired and the ranch in trouble if found. So he’s not exactly dealing well with his own past.<br /><br />Brody never got the real help for the issues his brutal adolescent and background still causes him but looses himself in training horses for the ranch. And self medicating when necessary when the past catches up, including his nightmares.<br /><br />Brody’s rescuer , the man who took him away from his abusive father, also works with him. His history is never far away.<br /><br />He sees himself in Kit.  And wants to take care of him? Finds the teen attractive in his totally needy, abused way? Everything about this , including keeping it a secret that Kit’s even at the ranch at the beginning starts the questions popping up in my mind about the relationship and storyline.<br /><br />Kit is regularly referred to a “kid” and acts like one. Although it’s made a point that’s he’s of “legal age”, nothing in this story, from the descriptions to his behavior will ever be anything that resembles something close to an adult. Instead Kit just presents as a somewhat broken, utterly youthful ,uneducated  if eager youngster. One in desperate need of therapy and stability.<br /><br />What he gets a older man who’s been as much if not more abused than he was, who decides how to fix and take care of the kid. Not as a family but as a lover.  Hmmmm.<br /><br />One of Kit’s few happy memories of one of his mother’s temporary boyfriend was a cowboy, a bronc rider.  Now Kit is rescued by a cowboy.  Can we say transference? Kit’s now isolated on a ranch, with someone who just rescued him, who “glows hero”, but not once does anyone mention what specifically Kit has undergone or that he needs therapy to understand just what his past history has done so he can better understand the choices made going forward.<br /><br />Things just continue to add up, and not in an enjoyable way.<br /><br />The author  uses terms such as “kid,  scared kid, scared foal, young animal, torn sneakers, skittish” over and over , adjectives used to describe very young people or animals when referring to Kit. These are not words I’d choose when applied towards adults or anyone of legal age.<br /><br />There’s just too much stuff here to unpack in a Amazon review but basically there’s a narrative where elements continue to add up that raise questions more than they give answers, to the point I almost stopped reading several times.<br /><br />This is not something I recommend.",1.0,0,2021

Excellent Dietary Advice and Natural Remedies for Dealing with Perimenopause!,"Ann Louise Gittleman is a nutrition expert who also specializes in topics women are concerned with in the challenging years of perimenopause. By reading this book you will learn life-saving information that can help you be healthier and happier! I feel better already just because I now feel understood.<br /><br />Are you feeling irritable, anxious, moody, weepy, fatigued and depressed? Are your periods irregular? That is what happens at the start of perimenopause and it can feel like the end of your world as I found out when I missed one period. Fortunately there is a lot of dietary advice and information on natural remedies that can turn your life back around.<br /><br />The most helpful advice in this book is to start using natural progesterone cream which has helped me greatly and changed my whole attitude to life in a matter of months. Now I'm happy again like I used to be. I'm not crying all the time anymore or feeling depressed and moody!<br /><br />What I loved about this book was how Ann Louise Gittleman gets right to the remedies so you can feel better fast.<br /><br />From my own experience with magnesium, I think Ann is right to recommend it to women my age. She mentions CALM magnesium which I'm a fan of now. She is also right about the right fats being slimming. A few weeks of using macadamia oil has great effects and I lost three pounds. This book introduces you to a different way of eating. You'll learn about adding coconut oil to your coffee and start using stevia as a sweetener for your drinks. She seems to be promoting a high-fat, low-carb diet.<br /><br />Some of the subjects this book discusses include: aging, estrogen dominance, allergies, anxiety, thyroid disease, bone broth, bile, bioidentical hormones, black cohosh, progesterone cream, breast cancer, cholesterol, diabetes, DHEA, good fats, GLA, headaches, heart disease, calcium supplementation, natural hormone therapy, osteoporosis, probiotics, uterine fibroids, uva ursi, water retention and weight gain.<br /><br />I learned a great deal about nutrition from reading this book and also discovered a few supplements that I want to try soon like black currant seed oil.<br /><br />I recommend the kindle book to those who need information fast and the paperback for those who want to go through the book with a highlighter and want to cook the recipes from the book. I have both! The paperback is really well designed but the print is small. So that may be a consideration if you are over 40 like me and need to wear reading glasses! The kindle book is easier to read.<br /><br />I think this book is for every woman to know about the stage of life called perimenopause before it happens. When you know there are so many remedies out there, there is less to fear! Empower yourself by reading this book sooner than later! I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I would however only recommend non religious meditation and yoga. The author doesn't differentiate between religious and non religious meditation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />P.S. I'm reading this book again and it is even better the second time. The best parts of the book are the sections on diet. I'm eating lemon curd Greek yogurt and kiwifruit. Delicious! Also eating more salmon and healthy vegetables. This book is inspiring! I'm also taking one tablespoon macadamia nut oil per day and feeling great. The blackcurrant seed oil is also helping me now that I'm taking it daily. Just take it in the morning since it seems to give you a lot of energy!",5.0,1,2021
Great Story,"I really enjoyed this series and thank you to the writers for offering it in one big box set. I loved all the characters: Callie, Montana, Magnar, Erik, Clarice, Julius, Miles, Warren, Chickoa, and even Fabian. There were times where I hated every single one of them, but I grew to appreciate them all despite their faults.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the books were their length! Not that I mind long books or anything, but there were some parts in the middle that went on and on with not much happening to move the plot along. This series could have been quite a bit shorter, but other than that, it was very well done and intriguing.<br /><br />Well done!",4.0,1,2021

The Best Cookie Book Ever,"I've had great success with Helen Fletcher's recipes before so I knew I had to have her new cookbook. As a cookbook collector, I already have several cookie books but this one is special. Usually I skim the Techniques and Ingredients sections, always intending to read them another day, but this time I sat and read them. I learned so much! The recipes are so enticing that I have already baked three of them: Chocolate Brownie Cookies (fudgy and delicious), Baileys Chocolate Crinkles (the liqueur adds a subtle flavor to these blissful bites), and Levain Style Chocolate Chip Cookies (6 ounces of chocolate chip studded dough for each cookie!).

Eat Restaurant Dishes at Home,"This collection of recipes from popular chain restaurants includes signature dishes from Applebee's, Olive Garden, Cheesecake Factory, Panera, Cracker Barrel, Red Lobster, P F  Chang's, and Starbucks.  For the most part, the recipes I tried did not disappoint.  However, I was disappointed that when they included Red Lobster's  coconut shrimp recipe, they used a standard chile sauce instead of their signature creamy pineapple dip.<br /><br />While the recipes turned out well, they were not easy to follow.  Dennis makes a point in the introduction of suggesting that cooks use a scale and measure ingredients by weight, but she doesn't list weight measurements for most of the recipes.  She also doesn't use the standard practices of putting the ingredient amounts first in the ingredient list (e.g., flour (.5 cups) instead of 0.5 cup flour) and listing the ingredients in the order they are used in the recipe.  The readability of the recipes and ease in following them would be greatly improved by using the recipe format most high-quality cookbooks follow and either hiring an editor with cookbook experience or trying to make the dish herself by simply doing exactly what the recipe says.  This is what a novice cook would and I expect that the novice would get confused in places.  I got confused by the instructions in places and I'm an experienced cook.<br /><br />She could have improved the readability of the book and made it much more interesting if she had written introductions to the recipes. I would have appreciated knowing why she chose those recipes and what she thinks makes them so popular.",3.0,0,2021
Girl Sees Angels - maybe 4.5 stars,"I've not read a book like this before and it drew me in.  I liked the characters and I liked the storyline.

Stunning,"As someone who lives in the Texas Great Plains, amidst cotton, corn, and wheat fields, I was looking forward to reading this story of my region as it was 80+ years ago during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl Days.  We still get the occasional dust storms, but nothing as described from those times.<br /><br />But this story was so much more, as it humanized the actual tragedies that happened to people who first stayed in the land to fight the elements and then were forced to leave the land, most going West to California.  There they lived in unimaginable conditions and treated like pariahs by the locals.  Abused by the growers who would lower their wages with little excuses and legally rob them by charging rent and making them buy at the company store where they would charge exorbitant prices.  All out on credit and deducted from wages, forcing them further in debt.  It was, in reality, slavery.<br /><br />Through it all we have the story of Elsa, a woman who finds her voice to say, ""Enough.""  Her courage and her love, a legacy she gives to her children.<br /><br />Beautifully written.  Had me crying at the end, a sign of how moved I was.",5.0,1,2021
Horrible Premise,This book was very disappointing after the enthusiastic reviews.  The premise was antiquated and revolting especially for a book set in the 1990's.

"Good, Bad and Confusing","What a strange read and a strange life!  The good includes that Mia is surprisingly one heck of a writer.  Some of the writing, especially early in the book is lovely and eloquent.  Other good elements are her frank discussion of polio, her parents and her sheltered, surreal childhood.  The confusing - how can anyone be that clueless?  She seems to feel nothing for breaking up Andre Previn's marriage and family, runs off into the jungle in India without a clue of the dangers, no red lights go off when Woody Allen refuses to engage with many of her children yet pays special attention to one.  Some of the stories were so bizarre I had a hard time believing them to be real.  The bad - wow, what a scum bag Woody Allen is!  Yet, her ditzy, flower child attitude enabled his horrific behavior to continue and flourish.<br /><br />I found the beginning of the book interesting, the middle okay, but the final third just made me what to slap both Woody Allen and her!  The final few pages about how idyllic her life is now with all of her happy, well-adjusted, successful children is downright delusional seeing that some of her children won't speak to her and others have died.  Not sure what planet this woman lives on and amazed she is still worth millions - utterly confusing.",3.0,0,2021
Not the thriller I was hoping for and nothing is resolved at the end,"Vanessa, Noelle, and Diamond are three women of varying ages with different backgrounds and personalities. They do have one thing in common though - they are all married to the same man. Wealthy businessman Cyrus Grey has been juggling three wives and a demanding business, but everything comes crashing down when he is shot outside one of his homes. As he remains in critical condition, secrets that both he and his wives were keeping begin to be revealed.<br /><br />I love the premise of this book and the characters are very interesting, but for the most part unlikable. I think Noelle is trying to do the right thing in an unimaginable situation and I felt sorry for Diamond who is trying to make a better life for herself. Most of my problem with the book is my expectations. I was expecting a domestic thriller, but the book is more of a romantic suspense about who shot Cyrus and that answer becomes evident fairly quickly. I was surprised by the number of steamy love scenes in the book. In addition, the book’s description states this is the start of a new series, but I didn’t realize that nothing would be resolved in this installment. The story ends abruptly with everything in limbo with a note to stay tuned for the next entry in the series. I don’t know how many books are planned in the series or when all the questions will be answered. The book is fast-paced, so it depends on what you are looking for. I was looking for a thriller with at least the main plotline resolved by the end, so I was disappointed.<br /><br />Thank you to NetGalley and Kensington Books for this ebook.

"An outstanding new series!  Dak Harper is here!  Look out, bad guys!","What a thrill ride this book was!  The action never stops - literally!  Dak Harper is ex-Delta Force, which tells you immediately that this will be a no-holds-barred fight between good and evil.  Dak accepts a job to recover an ancient sword, reported to have belonged to Conquistador Francisco Pizarro, now owned by the head of the largest cartel in Lima, Peru.  Sounds simple, right?  But Dak then discovers the horrible actions of the cartel, especially how they use children to deliver drugs and money to cartel locations around the city, putting them in danger of being hurt or killed.  Dak vows to put a stop to this, and, along with an old friend, he wages war on the cartel.  And I do mean war!  Yes, there is much more violence and bloodshed than in Ernest Dempsey's other books, but don't let that stop you from reading it, because, if you are like me, you will be cheering Dak on as he saves the innocents from the horrible lives they have been living.  I spent more time gasping and holding my breath than with any other book I have read.  In fact, I embarrassed myself once by loudly exclaiming ""YES!!"" - unfortunately , I was in a doctor's office at the time.  But it all worked out, because I introduced two other people to Ernest's books.  So, if you are not already a fan, get this book (or any of his books), and you will soon see why so many people love him.  Highly recommended - what an understatement!  Thanks again, Ernest.

Wimp who freezes in combat transported to a new world and turned into a girl...... Meh?,"The idea here is top notch.  The idea that a group of people are snatched from Earth and put into a new world is not a new one, but it has a lot of possibilities and this story takes advantage of those variants.  Its a solid foundation and placed in a rather well thought out world with a power progression system that doesn't instantly create OP morons.<br /><br />But, a great idea and plot needs a good main character, and I'm sorry, but Doug/Sabine is way too much of a spectator.  heck, given an opportunity to learn a skill all of his companions except one get combat skills (Axe wielding, archery, spear fighting, knife fighting, marksmenship), what does our ""hero"" get?  Read local language.<br /><br />I'm not kidding.  He's such of a non-combatant that he decides to get a skill to read.  Now it is possible that someone can create a hero who's only skill is reading, but..... that doesn't fit the world that our author worked so hard to create.<br /><br />Of course, this non-combatant issue shows up multiple times in the tale, except for when the author needs the hero to actually be ""heroic"".  Doug stands and watches as goblins attack, eventually taking a spear in the gut for his troubles.  Then they run into bandits and Doug/Sabine (he's turned into a girl by this point), stands around watching until directly attacked.  he also fails to support others because he's too busy thinking.<br /><br />But once in the first town she joins a brawling contest despite even saying that it was a bad idea (and then spends the time between each match thinking about how little she wants to fight, except for beating one of the other competitors.)<br /><br />The logic spirals out from there.  Its not terrible, but for me it was an endless impression of ""this character is worthless"".<br /><br />So story - good to borderline great<br />world building - solid<br />characters - bad, like really, really not worth reading about.<br /><br />High range 3 score.  Have the main character have any backbone and I might have given this a 4, but with a hero who watches fights rather than participating it can't get mroe than a 3.  I want a hero, not another zero.",3.0,0,2021
Bad due to not focusing on the main character,"This tale commits one major ""flaw.""  The title and blurb suggests that the main character is a professional ""goon"" or henchman who works for supervillains and that it is his journey we will be following as he navigates the world of heroes and villains.<br /><br />But we get a constant jump between this very pedestrian anti-hero who is far too willing to go with the flow and with suggestions given to him from others, and a couple of different heroes.<br /><br />Again, we jump focus between the main character who is a villain type and some heroes.  And these jumps are long, often occurring in overlapping timelines and extremely convoluted.  It was clear that the author wanted to write a mystery but rather than work it around one character, tries to use multiple conflicting characters to help blur the storyline and path.<br /><br />That never works for me anymore.  I dislike it when long established authors like David Weber does it, even when he has the experience to make the characters in the scene work.  Here, the characters did not work.  They were too unformed, and I quickly lost any interest.<br /><br />It might be a great book, but I just couldn't tolerate the focus jumps, so once again I have to give it 2 stars.  YMMV, but unless you like when the author jumps from character to character without clearly focusing on a single purpose or main character, I'd stay well away from this tale.",2.0,0,2021
It just wasn't compelling,"I usually like Daniel's tales.  He manages to have surprisingly human characters despite the power he gives many of them.  Sadly, this tale does not hit the high notes very well.  In fact, I'd argue that it is his weakest start to a series.<br /><br />The problem started with Stern.  He's not a bad person, but his physical looks while not well defined to the reader are continuously noted as being a major problem.  People react negatively to his appearance, and as he is empathic, he feels their fear and hatred.  it makes him a very unsympathetic character from the start.  There is a clear attempt to override this by making him seem a lot more approachable and honorable, but it still just left me feeling a bit cold.  I don't like anti-hero type characters and this was not even that.  It was an abused hero.<br /><br />That really became the foundation for my issues with the entire story.  The dungeon mechanics are not too outrageous although the perk system will almost certainly be abused by Daniel in future volumes.  And the two initial companions are fleshed out enough to make them memorable.  But when I compare this to the Binding Words or Aether's Rebirth series, it falls way short.<br /><br />Lovers of Daniel's style will probably enjoy this tale, although it is a significant departure from some of his usual writing style.  The themes of a harem following a special male is still there, and he does manage to pack a lot of adventure into the tale.  But when I rate it against other series and books I've read, it is not much better than average.",3.0,0,2021

Blacktop Bloodbath,"I understand the hype for this book, but it wasn’t for me.<br /><br />Maybe I’m not the target demographic this book, as I’m not much on cars/racing, but...I have an open mind.<br /><br />The extended violent scenes were...cumulative, overdone and exhausting.  Blacktop Bloodbath is more like it.<br /><br />The female characters were one-dimensional cliches.  Other reviews made note of too much telling and not enough showing.  As far as the violence goes, both telling and showing can push a novel out of fiction and into bloody cartoon territory.  The “bad guys” were also cliches.  Recycled retreads from movies and television.<br /><br />I can spot a set-up for a sequel/series a mile away in this one and I will pass on the next installment.  I’m still feeling sick from the graphic violence in this book, and disappointed, again, by the literary hype machine.",2.0,0,2021
"Review of entire trilogy.  First two books a 4, third book a 2.","Great world building, great characters, that you grow to like.  For the most part, showing, not telling.  Great narrative voice, it's easy to read.<br /><br />That said.  There are serious flaws.  By book three, all the hints have been dropped, the foreshadowing, has all been repeated, too many times, we get it, that's enough.  Everything has been set up, and it's time for some heavy handed RJ Barker philosophy, it's a nice enough philosophy, about a bunch of happy topics, but book plot just grinds to a halt.<br /><br />A big long pointless ocean chase, with ""clever ruses!""  that have been used before by other authors, that took up a quarter the book, then the loose end tie ups middle, some political intrigue which was fine, more philosophizing about things that really didn't need to be spelled out, because they'd previously been shown, but were spelled out anyway, I mean, you've got to know when to let a topic drop and just not hammer it over and over and...<br /><br />All the universe level drama gets resolved in the last few chapters, and we end up with still only a hint of how the whole thing works, or should work.<br /><br />I'd have preferred less navel gazing and more world creation drama.

Great story!,"This ""coming of midlife age"" story is really interesting! It took me a while to like the main character because our first intro is to an angry woman, who remains angry for a good while. Yes, causation is present, but it's challenging to feel genuine sympathy for a character who is not given a great deal of character to love and who is ready to jump into bed with someone almost immediately.  As the story progressed though, we are gifted more to like. I'm hoping in the next book, there is more to love about this lady. The storyline is great and the supporting cast is good.",5.0,1,2021
"Great book, huge improvement in writing","This was a delightful book that had some excellent character development alongside the rpg/cultivation elements.  Some character learned to acknowledge their past flaws without being crippled or completely defined by them, and others made mistakes that they nevertheless learned from.  I greatly appreciated Ryun's less one-dimensional character, and both he and Zach grow as people, if not always upwards.<br /><br />The system is not the crunchiest available, but is still reasonably thought out, and very flavorful.  Kal avoids the common mistake of delving too far into the details of an economy or management, while still giving just enough to flesh out the world.  Consistency is also improved over the prior books.  Although not perfect, Kal is clearly thinking about what titles people are likely to develop, and how some organizations might be farming them.<br /><br />As an aside, it looks like a reviewer is extremely upset that there are social elements he doesnt like.  Specifically, a nonstandard (ie, same-sex) relationship involving minor characters.  It was tasteful, directly discussed in 4 of the 45 chapters, provides some depth for those characters, and at one point is an impetus for character development of a main character, who realizes that he misses his deceased lover on observing a happy couple.  The reviewer also mentions a non-gendered *alien* that doesn't even appear in this book. Neither is a major plot focus, nor overtly political, except in the sense that any story is.",5.0,1,2021
Better than the average,Nice short history that is not complete leftist drivel. He has a somewhat large section of Trump....whom I feel is one of the most important presidents. It is somewhat orthodox and not super revealing about the power struggle between the collectivists and the individualists but it is much more honest than a lot of stuff and I think that it is good to brush up on what the majority have been programmed to think...; this however does show that we have been indoctrinated and gives a view of appreciation for our rights and not a ungrateful angry rant about racism and 'greedy' free market capitalism.  Decent read that can help hone your discernment of history.,3.0,0,2021
Another great addition to the series!,"Hawk is the 7th book in the Satan Sinner's MC universe, and focuses on recently initiated Hawk and Amara. It's best to read the books in order, and Serena Akeroyd's vivid writing and exciting plot keeps you connected and invested throughout each book. I love this one because though it focuses on our romantic leads, it also builds and expands so many plotlines that run through this MC series and the author's Irish Mob series, the Five Points. Highly suggest reading this book for:<br /><br />-a kind, patient, and understanding male character. Hawk is a brother in the MC, but he feels off balanced after his twin left. While he has the reputation of being grumpy, the glimpses we see of his inner thoughts about his family and how it affected his own views about life and love, his perceptive thoughts about his love interest Amara, and his desire to create a family of his own shows his hunger and determination to grab love when he sees it<br />-a resilient, possessive, blood thirsty female character whose transformation was as empowering as it was inevitable. While Amara's experience being trafficked was a horrendous ordeal, there's so much vulnerability and growth in her thinking and transformation from victim to survivor. I honestly fall for every new heroine we're introduced to, and Amara is no exception. We're here for a POWERFUL KWEEN.<br />-an unconventional love story that's full of mystery, heat, and a healthy dash of fate. The animal imagery of the majestic hawk, the timid little bird, and the lost buzzard are pretty prominent throughout this book, and it speaks to what love should be and do for you: surround you, lift you up, and help you fly. There's freedom in their love because they're not afraid or ashamed to show all the rough and damaged parts of their characters, which only makes them and their love more powerful.<br /><br />""Let's bring the thunder, sky girl.""",5.0,1,2021

Iffy review,"Lots of recipes, for sure.  But for me, I have a few issues that keep it from five stars.  Too many of the recipes are custard based using 5 egg yolks (a cholesterol nightmare in addition to permeating the recipe with eggy flavor and a cloying mouth feel).  Next, the repeated ""warm the mixture until small bubbles appear"" or ""until it starts to steam"" instead of just giving a thermometer temperature, and then again, ""'rewarm' the mixture until....""  None of the desired results arise from a ""warmed"" mixture, it's unnecessarily imprecise and misleading.  But a real biggie, each recipe has a paragraph or more introducing it.  However, it's disappointing that in a book filled with recipes (and that's the whole point of buying it), these preambles talk about where the author was or what happened the day he tried the subject kind of ice cream instead of describing the subject recipe's consistency or its flavor range or tips about the ingredients or other information that has some relevance to the recipe.<br />The one thing I do like about it is he provides links, which on the Kindle edition lets you go direct and then hit the back button to return to the recipe.  And another thing i quickly derived from the book as a newbie ice cream maker when I bought it -- by reading one recipe after another that are an exact reprint except changing to different flavorings, you see the pattern loud and clear so you become emboldened to just use whatever base you gravitate toward (either a 5-egg custard as written, or the so-called ""Philadelphia"" base which has no eggs, where you can use 1/2C instant nonfat dry milk powder to absorb the free water with no cost of taste, and get the same creaminess (or better) either just with that or perhaps 1/4 tsp. each of guar and locust bean gum powders (plant based) where the guar addresses creaminess and viscosity and the LBG helps control ice crystal growth.<br />All in all, I would personally not invest in the hard copy of this book should you have a Kindle.",3.0,0,2021

All of the usual genre flaws blossomed in a bad way.,"I have a few regular complaints with LitRPG tales, and sadly Temper proved to dive into many of those issues creating a tale that dragged at times, and was overly obvious in others.<br /><br />The first and biggest problem is the idiocy of the characters.  There were so many moments that the characters did things that made absolutely no sense to me.  They talked when action was required.  They backed down when they had opportunities to push forward to complete things.  They ignored some obvious hints that certain members of the larger group needed to be eliminated before they turned on the group.  It was just a collection of what I felt were cringe worthy decisions and habits.  I don't like this, but it is far too common in this kind of tale.<br /><br />Second is the hero who can't prioritize things.  I think the series The Land had this problem to a higher degree, but the hero here is told he needs to grab ""nodes"", and he has the ability to identify them.  But then he scouts 3, coming close to taking out one only to decide ""let's go check out the fourth one I know about"", leaving the one node they have already half beat alone.  Then the node he decides to check out takes some 5 different trips before he manages to finish, and of course that delay results in a massive number of unnecessary casualties.<br /><br />But wait.  We have villains who are extremely powerful in some ways, resulting in the hero being almost powerless at times despite the hero being so OP that even the other characters mention how powerful he is.  And as always I find myself shaking my head.  The power levels need to be dropped.  Honestly, I'm reminded of a note given to Game Masters in the foreword for a GM's guide I read 20+ years ago.  The writer pointed out that most people want their adventures to be tough, but winnable.  They find a greater emotional payoff if the hero finishes the adventure like John McClane at the end of Die Hard.  Yes, they struggled.  Yes, they got hurt.  But at the end they walk out victorious.  But stories like this turn fights into ""we'll have all the redshirts die and be forced to some completely inexplicable Deus ex Author twist to survive and win the fight"" or ""Nothing happened in this fight.""<br /><br />The book isn't bad, and the series was definitely an inspired idea.  But I have to say that in my mind this book does not really qualify as a good story.  It uses over-powered, but stupid characters constrained by the author's need to push the plot not through their own actions, but with inserted perils that always push the stakes higher.<br /><br />Its a 3 star tale.  Needs to have been better thought out.",3.0,0,2021
Repetitive,"I did not like this book bcz of it's repetitive storylines. (If I NEVER see another mango, coconut, or papaya, it will be too soon.) Hundreds of references to the characters eating this. Really unnecessary. The opening scenes of the book were so confusing because they hopped so fast I couldn't catch my breath.And not in a good way. I won't get into the story, so as not to spoil it for other readers. However, I will say that I enjoyed being a part of the Ocean stuff. I hung in there to the end and read the entire book. Yet it was extremely difficult, due to the repetition of nearly everything. The other extremely difficult part was the implausibility of so very much. Believability simply was not there. Many little details missing, or crazily exaggerated. Details make it more *real"" sounding. I couldn't even call it fantasy. Even fantasy has believable details. Additionally, the ongoing references to sexual innuendo between 2 of the characters, was completely inappropriate and ill fitting for the situation. It is like it came out of nowhere and spoiled the entire setting. Nobody in their right mind - on the entire planet - would ever think of sexual stuff, after having been through what those characters had gone through. That was just 1 more example of implausibility. It did not go unnoticed that the author chose to stereotype the Mexican man, as some ""wolverine sex pot,"" which is quite telling as to her own racial profiling belief.  Lastly, I gave it 2 stars bcz I know how hard it is to write a book. The author is to be commended for her tenacity and hard work. Otherwise, this book gets zero stars from me.",2.0,0,2021

It was fun watching Cendrilla grow, discover her own strength/powers and become far more than anyone expected from an orphaned servant.  This book is full of girl power.

DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST,"I was so disappointed in this, the last Inspector Montalbano book, that I was barely able to finish reading it.  It was clear that Montalbano was tired of his job, burned out, ready to retire, but breaking of the fourth wall with Montalbano arguing with ""the author"" about the plot of the book, completely ruined it for me.  I can understand a character wanting to leave his career but the nonsense of talking to the author of the book was so off-putting that it left me angry.  I have read every one of the Montalbano mysteries over the years and liked some more than others but always felt satisfied with the endings even when they ended on a frustrating note.  This book, however, ended so badly that again, I felt disappointed and angry.<br /><br />I'm sorry that there will be no further Inspector Montalbano books but I can always begin the series again.

"Fast paced, interesting read but unbelievable","I won this in a Goodreads and and was really looking forward to it.

I don't handle violence or really any abuse on kids well and the very first chapter is brutal (to put it mildly), so if you're like me and child abuse or sexual assault is triggering, I would say away from this one!<br /><br />I did manage to read the entire book and it got easier the more I read.

Not good,"Trigger warning for rape<br /><br />The story is told in such a passive voice that it’s impossible to really care about any of the characters. It also consists of everything being told, not shown. I was curious what would happen with the ghosts, which is why I kept reading. There is no style to the writing other than a lack of style. In the parts that aren’t just descriptions, the characters are superficial.<br /><br />It sort of plods along until the 80% mark, at which point the husband, possessed by the male ghost, rapes his wife. She has to beat him off. But once he’s himself again, it’s as if the whole thing didn’t happen and she has no hesitation around her husband (I think anyone in this circumstance would possibly display some hesitation and mistrust—rape is still rape). Along with this, she also shortly after feels like making love—RIGHT AFTER THE RAPE.<br /><br />I confess I read to the end. The male spirit is banished far too easily (and if the had just listened to the psychic’s advice in the first pace…) It gets more ridiculous. The ending is just a groaner but the time it gets to the supposed twist ending.",1.0,0,2021

Travel and change of place impart new vigor to the mind.  ~ Seneca,"“Nine Ladies” is a travelogue of sorts – a journey in time and not in distance.<br /><br />The actual “Nine Ladies” is a Bronze-Age Stone Circle located in Stanton Moor, in Derbyshire.  Traditionally, the circle is believed to depict nine ladies turned to stone as a penalty for dancing on Sunday.  Druid rituals are still celebrated there.<br /><br />In this story, the Ladies are on Pemberley land.<br /><br />In 2011, Elizabeth Bennet, an American residing in Britain following the death of her father, visits the Nine Ladies during a vernal equinox.  Then she is in 1811.<br /><br />Half the fun of the travel is the esthetic of lostness.  ~ Ray Bradbury<br /><br />Elizabeth is moved 200 years!  Talk about Jet Lag!!!<br /><br />As a 21st century woman, Elizabeth is aware of the history of Pemberley:  a sad destiny that includes the early death of the young master, the unhappy fate of his sister, and the ruination of a grand estate.<br /><br />In 1811, Pemberley residents are aware of the power of the Nine Ladies and the occasional visitor from the future.  Elizabeth is confined in her room until she begins to understand her situation.  The circle will not open again for three months when the next solstice occurs.  She must adjust to a very different life.<br /><br />Eventually, in an effort to save the life of Pemberley’s master, Elizabeth travels with Mr. Darcy to 2011 where he may receive a modern treatment.  Now it is Darcy’s turn to adjust to a different life.  Not surprisingly, his adjustment is more of a shock than Elizabeth’s, since she had the advantage of history.  Darcy did not have the advantage of foreknowledge.<br /><br />The story revolves around two issues:<br />How can Pemberley’s fate be changed?<br />How can a couple separated by 200 years be a couple?<br /><br />I enjoyed the look at a very different Mother Bennet.  Abandoned by her husband, Mrs. Bennet encouraged (insisted, cajoled, goaded, egged on, nattered at) her two daughters to acquire the education that would enable them to support themselves without a male.  Jane has achieved that goal.  Elizabeth — not so much.<br /><br />I had a good chortle at a reference to Mrs. Danvers.<br /><br />Usually, I tune out a JAFF time-travel book.  This story was recommended to me when it was available online.  I put it on the back burner, even though the author is a favorite of mine.  When the author offered me an ARC without requiring a review, I bit the bullet and accepted.<br /><br />I was drawn into the story immediately.  I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys JAFF.<br /><br />The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land.  ~ G.K.

Pretty good,"This is translated from Japanese and so it shares the quirks of all light novels that are translated from Japanese. The language is sort of stilted sometimes. Occasionally odd words are used in place of more common synonyms. The characters spend alot of time discussing how they will address each other. If you've read many Japanese light novels, you know all about this and what to expect.<br /><br />The story itself is about a 16 year old kid who is way over powered and who wants to retired from the military but isn't allowed to. He quickly accumulates a harem-ish group of female followers who he doesn't have sex with, all of whom admire him and who he teaches and leads. Again, this is nothing new.<br /><br />The protagonist is interesting but not well defined in this volume. His interactions with the girls are funny but not super funny. There's some action but it's not wall to wall action. There is some exposition on the magic system and the way society is put together but not alot of that either. The overall effect is to create a book that is kind of middle of the road and not really well-focused on anything. Part of that may be a translation issue and part of it might be because this is volume one. Either way nothing about this story really stands out vs other novels in this genre. It's not the most innovative in terms of ideas, not the scariest, not the most action-packed, not the sexiest, not the funniest, etc.<br /><br />I hope future novels serve to better define what exactly makes this series special. As it is, this is a perfectly serviceable first novel and it's entertaining and easily readable so assuming that the story is actually going somewhere in future installments there is no reason not to read this one.",4.0,1,2021
What is wrong with Anna?,"Ok I had a few issues with this book like how is anyone as timid and naive as this protagonist. With no real info on her past its a little hard to believe anyone could be this shy and timid. Also for she ever get to eat? She stands behind her employer during meals and there is never any mention of poor Anna ever getting to eat at the hotel except once or twice during their stay. And when is she finally going to ask her employer about the trust her employer established in his will. The reader could really use some backstory to help sell the character. After 2 books I still don't know how old Anna is, I only know she's been in this position for four years and she still is too timid to speak to her employer. I think the series has promise with the first book but since the second book didn't answer any of the questions raised in book 1 My interest is lagging.",3.0,0,2021
Great series so far but…,"Love this series but the one thing that makes me take off stars is the lack of romance. I understand that it’s not a main theme of the book but the lack of romance and the unwilling main character kind of ruins the vibe. She’s constantly rebuffing Samuel and it was okay at first and now it’s just annoying. Like it’s being dragged out way too much and that makes me not want to continue to read this series. Which is really sad because I like the books. It’s just too frustrating, she clearly doesn’t like Samuel and basically hates him it’s not cute anymore. The moments that she is okay with him romantically are fleeting and now the romance between them is so unappealing.",3.0,0,2021
Hart and Eleanor's love story.... was so so!,"** 2.75 stars **<br /><br />I must say that this book didn't live up to my expectations. I was really intrigued after a short snippet in Cam and Ainsley's book featuring Eleanor and Hart. The story started well. It was steadily paced with plenty longing from both MCs. At first I really liked how both MCs were not antagonistic toward each other, they just got each other. But then I found out why Eleanor jilted Hart. WTF? That was so inconsistent with the character the author was trying to portray - sensible and smart, as well as inconsistent with time period. For Eleanor to be so easily swayed and manipulated and to throw Hart under the bus.... It changed the story for me and I started disliking the overly kind Eleanor which bordered on silly at times.<br /><br />As this series progresses so does the the amount of intimate scenes increases. I guess the author is banking on $*x appeal to bring in the readers because the story really slows down. The last part of the book was a total muddle.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the lack of emotional depth in both Eleanor and Hart. Despite evident angst, copious amounts of tears both characters were dry and bland. I didn't feel romance between them at all. The whole dark desires angle was weak and didn't amount to anything.<br /><br />What did save the story for me was The Mackenzie clan. I loved how the family grew and how they interacted with each other. Ian was featured more prominently than others and I liked that. The epilogue was a saving grace for this story. Without it I would have given this book 2 stars for sure. I am a bit wary about reading the next book in the series. I want a good story but it seems like the author really puts too many intimate encounters instead of plot twists and character development. We shall see.",3.0,0,2021
Back with the silver elves from space,"So, if you enjoy this series, this is another strong entry with the usual writing style and plot. Meanwhile, the plot for this series is advanced a bit further. I'm sure more info will be provided in the next book, as well, as the foolish human government continues to try the insane, and the General must save them, in spite of themselves.<br />If you are considering reading this book as your entry into the series, I would suggest caution and suggest that you either start at the beginning (Dark Planet Warriors) or you perhaps start with the first Darkstar Mercenary series. I started with the latter and was able to follow it easily and then go back and read the others.",5.0,1,2021
Eloquent and too much.,"Peter Heller writes so evocatively that reading him often feels like living in a dream.  One feels not only the emotions but the sights, smells and sounds in three dimensions and sometimes more.  In his previous novels, there has mostly been a good balance between these intangibles and the powerful, meaningful human reality that he also constructs with skill and perception.  Here, however, the atmospheric and human components both overflow into an unbearable flood of poignancy.  There is much to admire in the story and much to love in the characters, but ultimately reading through to the end becomes like torture.  Lighten up a bit, Mr. Heller; please.",3.0,0,2021

Stories from a Stalker,"That's what the book should be named....I'm sorry to say it, but I call 'em like I see 'em.<br />Talitha started out by attending many MJ concerts in Europe and making sure she was in the front rows where she assumed that MJ noticed her.  Her obsession grew when she moved to the USA/Los Angeles (from Ireland) because he lived around there.  Aside from following him locally, Talitha followed him around the country and world to various events, sometimes using a press pass to get into where other fans could not.  Other times, she faked passes/documentation needed to gain entry or just slid in with another group.  She and other fans waited outside of his house day and night-not just once or twice-but regularly. (She kept a calendar and journal of this) If that's not bad enough, they followed him to his doctor's appointments and glommed on to him on his way in AND out-not just once, but regularly.  He honestly couldn’t go anywhere without her and the others trailing behind. They even got to his vehicles at stop lights hoping for conversation.  During the trial, Talitha moved not too far from Neverland.  She also moved to Las Vegas when he did so she could have more convenient access to him. She moved back to LA when he did for the same reason. Talitha knew where and when MJ went places.<br />Did Talitha know him and interact with him? Yes. He recognized her and got to know her name in time. To be fair, he encouraged her and the others. He would interact with them. He would stroke her face and hold her hand and say sweet things. The thing is, that's how he was. He was a hand holder to everyone. He said nice things. He regularly told everyone he loved them. He gave gifts to people regularly-not just her--though he never got her anything expensive. She failed to realize that she was one of hundreds (or more) throughout the years. I think she was obsessed with him and in love with him due to his encouragement.  MJ allowed it not only because she seemed like a benign stalker (in contrast to some who were too aggressive with him), but also because having a group of people following him and gathering by his home made him look better. He needed that for his image and he needed the cards and encouragement from his fans especially after the second trial when he was feeling so low. Talitha once made the claim of being clairvoyant. That’s a joke. If you follow someone around so much and know their habits as well as regular destinations, you would know where to find that person. No clairvoyance was involved. Talitha never spent one-on-one time JUST with MJ. There was always someone else there such as his kids, his body guards, other fans, etc. She got to go inside of his home twice but not because she was invited specifically. She tagged along with another fan who WAS invited in and that was only because he had some vintage merch to give MJ as a gift. (also as part of a group allowed in Neverland) Talitha was only just a fan to him. A devoted fan. An obsessed fan. Never a girlfriend (as much as she would have loved that). She even mentions times after his doctor's appointments when they would wait and wait outside (for hours and hours) and then glom on to him when he came out then try to tag along with him when he went shopping after. After one doctor's visit, she said they were kissy kissy in his limo but it couldn't have been that intense because there was someone there who took a picture. Her description of the scene leads me to believe that he may have been out of it from his appointment still but I give her credit for noting that there were people before her having interactions and after her in the line and that someone told her to let other people have their turn-so he very well may have done the same with them? Talitha wrote MJ massively long letters that he could only read a few pages at a time and also some sappy poem that she shared in the book.<br />In any event, it was really nice to see how awesome MJ was to his fans. He would toss things down to them from hotels. He would send pizza out to them. He sent thank you notes for gifts given to him as well as quick notes and autographs. He had his children do the same.  I enjoyed reading those things about him which is why the book got 3/5 stars.<br />I’m sure that Talitha is a very nice person. I know she expressed guilt over not preventing MJ’s death via fan notes and a statement paragraph she hadn’t read to him.  I believe that even if she had given him 10,000 fan letters(instead of 30) and done a 10 minute speech, MJ was going to do what MJ wanted to do. I hope that Talitha’s gotten married and moved on from the fandom into a more normal existence.  Frank Cascio’s book was so much better because he actually knew the real MJ good and bad.  Talitha only knew what MJ wanted the fans to see.",3.0,0,2021
Heart wrenching read.,"I was reading through a few of the negative reviews for this book and a thought occurred to me.  Are these the type of people who go onto recipe share sites, alter the recipe beyond recognition, have poor results and then leave negative reviews for the person who submitted the original recipe? Do they read books and feel upset because they didn't like the author's 'recipe' for the book because it wasn't written how they would have liked thus it didn't bend to their personal viewpoints and needs?<br /><br />Whether for good or for bad, when one reads an historical novel one needs to consider what was normal behavior and procedure for middle and lower class people of that time period. People had shorter life-spans, the male population was sparse because there had been a world war. People married early whether out of necessity, convenience or love and started their families. Take into consideration that the majority of women did not hold down jobs so they needed a man to support them in adulthood. Most people had home births and the technology we take for granted today to support women with endangered pregnancies didn't exist. People made lots of babies without much available in the way of birth control, thus there not being much need to focus on anything which curtailed the population. Lots of hungry mouths to feed in those days.<br /><br />That said, people didn't spend much time sitting around and discussing their feelings. Men were taught that showing emotion was unmanly.  Women were taught to put their husbands needs before their own to keep their husbands comfortable and happy.  Add to this you have a man who obviously suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and doesn't want to dredge up his emotional wounds. Life was hard and people needed to focus on survival vs feelings. As it has been said, ""Only the strong survive."" Someone had to maintain the home. Someone needed to provide a means to put food on the table.  Animals and children needed to be tended. Lots of responsibilities maintained daily to keep their heads above water.<br />If you have ever read older novels written during this time period and earlier, you will likely find none of dwell on people's feelings much beyond naming them...anger, madness, love and the like.<br /><br />As for the novel itself, I enjoyed it. I think the author did a good job building the story around the characters.  As per the bad choices, who among us has not made bad choices? Given the degree of hopelessness and depression Isobel must have experienced wanting children so desperately and failing to produce any live births, it was easy to see how she rationalized the baby was probably orphaned, needed parents and was a gift from God. She and Tom quickly fell in love with the baby in spite of Tom's dilemma of doing the 'right' thing legally vs. the 'right' thing to do for Isobel.<br /><br />As horrid as the situation which evolved became once the story came out, in the end it had to be that way.  The wrong needed to be righted. So it was.",5.0,1,2021

Great so far,"I'm always leary when the author of a best-selling series begins a new series situated outside his professional and geographic comfort zone, in this case DNA and Salt Lake City.  Maddie, the main character in ""Chester Creek"", would appear to be patterned after Forensic Genealogist CeCe Moore but oddly, she isn't named as as one of NDG's sources in this field that continues to bring closure to the coldest of cold cases. Despite this, he seems to have acquired more than a working knowledge of how to ""build out"" family trees from matches to the DNA sample of an unknown perp. I've also been in awe for years of the actual British genealogy record repositories and websites Morton Farrier, the main character in Goodwin's first series, uses to solve cases.  He is just as careful to have Maddie and the members of her team of researchers use real resources available to those of us on this side of the Pond.<br /><br />That said, Goodwin has provided us with a well-developed cast of regular characters no doubt we'll learn more about in the next book, which he has already set up to focus on a present-day serial killer in Twin Falls, Idaho.  A continuing sub-plot will be the disappearance of Maddie's husband under mysterious circumstances 5 years earlier.<br /><br />Of course, I'd love a new Morton Farrier but if the first book is any indication, the Venator series promises to be as engaging and have as many plot twists as the Farrier series.",5.0,1,2021
#Waste of time #imout,"This book was just awful. The main character was a moron, it started out all hot and sexy with the idea of sex clubs and fantasies and then turned out to be a ridiculous and silly story that about 40% into the book I had to quit because it was just so ridiculous. Initially I thought the main character was kind of cute but then she just turned out to be a ridiculously ditzy person and the hot scenarios turned out to be a weird start to a romance that I couldn’t get on board.

Humous Book about Living Out Our Dreams,"In Bamboozled by Jesus, Yvonne Orji tells the story of how her life and how God bamboozled her into living out her dreams. She revealed how she became a comedian and an actress on HBO’s show, Insecure. She stated how this book is a “Get Yours” book and not a self-help book. In the book she covered 25 lessons and divided into 5 sections, “The Burden, Building, Breakthrough, and Blessing”. She uses humor and personal stories to convey the secrets to living out your dreams. She begins the book by sharing how in the beginning how she was conceived. Her parents already had three sons and they were done having kids. But then God had other plans. She jokes about how she was born holding her mother’s IUD in her hands. She explained how this was her experience with being bamboozled by Jesus. She also refers to how God is like a Sovereign Trickster sometimes acting like Ashton Kutcher in Punk’d.<br /><br />She revealed the do’s and don’t of getting bamboozled. One of the first rules was don’t check the fine print. She joked about how many people don’t read the two thousand pages on Apple’s terms and conditions before agree to them. She explained how that much attention to detail doesn’t help anybody. She then goes on to explain how she come to know Jesus and how many of us don’t read the fine print when we choose to follow Jesus or if we did some of us might jump the ship. She tells the story about how she was on the way to the club in her college days with her friend. But her friend wanted to go to the church before they hit up the club. She had also planned to wait until she turned 18 years old to lose her virginity and this was based on fear and not because of her faith. She was three months away and had already planned how she was going to lost it. God reached her and changed her mind and she decided to save it for marriage and at 37 years old she is still waiting. She was able to surrender her life to Jesus and be changed. She also looked at Joseph and retold the story in a modern twist and how he was bamboozled by Jesus.<br /><br />I would recommend this awesome humous book to anyone who is needing a good laugh. I also liked how she told the Biblical story in current times in order to provide some new insights and to also help readers to see the stories in a fresh preceptive. I enjoyed how funny she was and how added humor to her own life story. I loved how she related her lessons back to scriptures and teaching of Jesus. One of my favorite chapters was the one on how our haters will be our elevators. I liked how she shared how she overcame her own haters and what God has declared over our lives about how our enemies will be our footstools. I also liked the bamboozled beliefs special section in the back of the book to provide readers with a morning mantra to encourage them to keep chasing their dreams.",5.0,1,2021
"Exquisite, Delightful, Perfect","J. M. Stengl is VERY quickly becoming one of my all-time favorite authors! This novella is absolutely wonderful in every way: the cadence and narration is addictive (it felt good reading the lines in my head, if that makes sense?), the characters are gorgeous and fascinating, the pacing is perfect for a shorter story, the tone and feel of the tale are mystifying but exquisite. In short, I was hooked. In fact, excuse the pun, I gobbled up this novella in two sittings!<br />Every element of this tale is fun, down to the hilarious dedication at the beginning and the last two perfect lines. I love how unique the story is: although there are elements (and some Easter eggs, which are so rewarding when you catch them!) of the classic ""Red Riding Hood"" archetype, the book is completely different and it's own independent captivating story. Barbaro and Cerise have alluring chemistry, and paired with the masterfully-written mystery surrounding the plot, I adore this book in every way. It feels to me like a masterpiece of a novella, and as someone who has read Stengl's other beautiful books, I cannot wait for her next release!",5.0,1,2021

Disappointing,"This is a story that’s supposed to be a mystery, about a 15 year old girl who is found dead, but it really isn’t. This is more of a story about a Chicago investigative TV reporter, Jordan Manning. I found her to be an obnoxious, self-involved person, one who wants you to think she cares about others, but it’s always all about her. She lies easily, pretends to befriend people she thinks can help her, and takes advantage of everyone she can to get her story. She’s incredibly racist and misandrist. Yes, she’s black, but it’s clear that she completely dislikes white people and men. She’s whiny and self-important. She’s reckless, impulsive, and unconcerned for her own safety, or anyone else’s. I didn’t like her at all.<br /><br />If all that’s not enough, she not only has a journalism degree, but also has one in forensic science. She’s says she's certified as a crime scene investigator in both Illinois and her home state of Texas. Personally, I find that hard to believe. Even harder to believe is that she carries an official police evidence collection kit in her purse, and she doesn’t hesitate to use it. All I could think was that she was likely invalidating and disqualifying evidence she was collecting without police approval. I mean, is she a reporter, or is she a forensic crime scene investigator? I don’t think she can legitimately be both at the same time.<br /><br />Honestly, if I was a professional journalist, I’d be embarrassed to release a book like this, even an advanced reader copy. I doubt that the author even bothered to proofread the book before turning it into her publisher. It’s filled with misused words, continuity errors, and the writing is immature and amateurish. The characters are primarily stereotypes, and the story often takes melodramatic turns. The names of people, ones who have little involvement in the story, except that Jordan knows them or is friends with them, litter the pages, cluttering up the narrative. I don’t really need to know how she met every one of her friends or acquaintances, or any of the other extraneous information that pops up.<br /><br />Often, the writing has a stream-of-consciousness feeling to it. The dialogue often presents as stilted and forced, offering far more unrequested information than one would naturally offer in conversation. Support characters are flat, not one of them is fleshed out. They’re only there as devices for Jordan’s use.<br /><br />As for the mystery, the author gives away everything as the story develops; there is no big denouement, no dramatic revelation. I wasn’t surprised by anything. Secrets? There aren’t any. Things often either drag or jump out of nowhere. It's a slow read. This would have been a much better book if it had focused on the mystery, not given the surprises away, and kept Jordan Manning in the background.<br /><br />What’s a “liquor lounge”? Or a “music lounge”? I live in Chicago, and I’ve heard of bars and taverns, night clubs, cantinas, saloons, and taprooms. I’ve never heard of a liquor lounge, but it appears multiple times in this book. My kid is a professional musician with lots of friends who are professional musicians, classical and jazz, a racially diverse group; none of them have ever heard of a music lounge. Also, when the author talks about Austin, it wasn’t always clear if she was referring to her hometown of Austin, Texas or the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. Speaking of neighborhoods, if you’re not from the Chicago area, a lot of the towns, neighborhoods, and street names will mean nothing to you, and they will likely draw you out of the story.<br /><br />This is supposed to be the first book in a series. I won’t be seeking out any further installments in the series. I found the writing sub-par and the main character unlikable and impossible to sympathize with. There are so many better books available that are true mysteries with characters that are believable, ones with whom you can commiserate, a plot is better thought out, and writing that is worth your time reading.<br /><br />This book was a massive disappointment. I do not recommend it. Unless major revisions were made in final editing, this book is sorely lacking.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have never watched Tamron Hall on television, not when she was, apparently, on the news, and not now that she appears to have a talk show. My loyalties lie with a different network than the one with which Ms. Hall is connected. My opinions in this review were influenced only by the characteristics of this book.<br /><br />I received an advanced reader copy of this book from the publisher through Netgalley.

Unpolished,"This book is definitely in need of an editor. Sentences are split up (example: “Between the overgrown grass, and debris. I’m not sure what I’ll tread on.”), and the flow of the story is stiff. The conflict at the beginning of the book that causes her to leave is abrupt with no backstory or buildup. The action and dialogue is choppy, and the way things are described is weird (for example, she internally wonders what brought a girl with tattoos to the town since she hasn’t seen anyone else with tattoos and red hair). At that point in the story, she’d seen exactly three people total in the town, so it was a weird comment to make. In one conversation, she tells the realtor that the town people can ask her anything because she’s an open book. In the very next conversation she has, she tells her landlord that she’s a private person. There are just a lot of inconsistencies and the writing style just isn’t great.

But more importantly, I hated them! Tristan is such a push-over. He'd go on about being a big, tough warrior who could handle anything. The next sentence he's acting like a toddler. Emotionally he's four years old, no matter how much he wants to be forced into bed. Another disturbing thing. Don't get me started on Corrick. He has zero redeemable qualities. Spanking a so-called grown man, especially for simply asking questions or trying to maintain a shred of his former self, is unforgivable. I don't care if Tristan wants a spanking. It's never something deserved because of his actions, and as a mother I found it horrific. If I can find creative ways to discipline four defiant monsters, Corrick can come up with something else. It's never discipline with him; it's punishment and that doesn't solve problems. I kept hoping for something to get me through to the next book, but I can't stand either characters. I'd really expected more from all these great reviews. Sadly, I was led astray.",1.0,0,2021

Interesting storyline but desperately needs editing,"This is a four book series that intrigued me after reading the first book, so I bought the complete set. But in book 2 I nearly quit reading out of frustration with all of the errors. The most egregious error out of a host of errors is a chapter that is completely misplaced (in Kindle version). Eventually you come to where the chapter belongs and it is repeated there as well, but it appeared many chapters earlier, obviously in error. If you're bothered by an author using a word that that doesn't mean what they think it does, or spelling errors, or inconsistencies in the plot, then you'll often be frustrated reading this series.",2.0,0,2021
Great story lines which intersect,"The book starts with a murder on a stalled Metro train. The setting is northern England,  Christmas time, snow causing delays for all the travelers.  Sgt. Joe Ashworth is trying to get home with his daughter when the train stops. The lights go out and in that short time an elderly woman is murdered - it's Joe's young daughter Jess who discovers the body as she tries to awaken the woman.<br />I like the character Joe Ashworth and am pleased how his role is developing in this series. Vera is not an easy woman to work for and has some annoying traits but she is mellowing.<br /><br />The investigation begins on Harbour Street where the murdered woman lived and through the questioning, it appears there are shady connections with residents of the street. There is another mystery and murder which will  relate to an unsolved case from decades prior.<br /><br />This is book 6 in the Vera Stanhope series.  I love the detective Vera for her flaws, for not being the well dressed, elegant beautiful detective star so many series have.  Vera can be ill tempered and impatient, a loner who imbibes too much some days, a woman who exudes confidence yet is scarred by her father Hector's verbal abuse when she was a child. That's a side she never shares publicly.<br /><br />Onward to the last three in this series and I will be caught up.",4.0,1,2021
"An old house, mystery and lots of birds","I saw this book on sale at Amazon and the description appealed to me.  There is an old house, a cozy cottage and its on an isolated island off the Scottish coast.  There is also a mystery and lots bird watching activity so this all appealed to me.  Yeah, I am a nerd about stories featuring old houses or mentions of birds/wildlife.<br /><br />Our main character is Rose Fenemore, a college professor of English and also a poet. She finds an advertisement for a rental on an isolated island off Scotland.  It’s a perfect retreat for her to relax and work on her poetry without interruptions by students or campus life.  Rose invites her brother, an avid bird watcher, to come along for the vacation. Sounds like a relaxing place with peace and quiet.<br /><br />One evening after Rose is in bed she hears a door open downstairs and goes to investigate, thinking her brother finally arrived.  There is a stranger in her kitchen who proceeds to tell her this used to be his childhood home.  Right there I had to suspend disbelief as Rose’s reaction was more of annoyance rather than fear.  Rose is 27 years old, not a big woman and she is suddenly alone in complete isolation with a stranger.  She makes him a cup of coffee and they chat a bit. But then, even odder, another man turns up on this stormy night. He also coms in. Hmmmm…<br /><br />What I liked about the book was the setting and descriptions of the island.  The quieter and slow pace of life appeals to me very much.  The birds, seals, old house on the hill and residents of the island were described well. The mystery regarding the two men is solved and there is a hint of romance on the horizon here.<br /><br />Seems I read a book by Mary Stewart a long time ago but I can’t remember which one, just remembered I liked the style so this sounded like a good plot.  Apparently from other reviews I am seeing this wasn’t her finest book.  I would certainly try more by this author and start with recommendations from her avid fans.",4.0,1,2021

Good Beginning,"I’ve read a lot of Starr Huntress books, and generally speaking, I’m a fan. I picked up this book mainly because it was the beginning of a series, and seem to keep jumping into series in the middle, and I wanted to start something from the beginning. I think this is a pretty decent start to a new series, if I had to guess everyone on the ship is going to get a mate.<br />But first we start with Rachel and Thelkor. I like Rachel a lot, she’s motivated, skilled, friendly, she is just one likable character. She signs up for the mating matching so that she can get enough money to buy her own ship. She’s a little leery at first, but she’s also open with her personality, and she jumps right in to the crew as a pilot without any second thought. I really liked her dynamics with all the members of the crew, and how quickly she feel into the mission, and frankly how good she was at not just being a pilot, but with the mission itself.<br />Thelkor was less likable, especially in the beginning. He comes off as short tempered, drunk, and kind of arrogant. He is clearly against the whole mating thing, so for a good portion of the book there is this kind of push and pull dynamic which makes for some great tension. He also becomes more likable as the book goes on.<br />I think one of the big plusses of this book is the actually mission that the crew is going on. It’s action packed, and investigative, and you get to see how everyone works and their roles on the crew. It’s not so cluttered that you can’t follow it, but not so laid back that you loose interest. Overall, I liked this book. I will definitely see where the story goes from here.",4.0,1,2021
Read slowly as if indulging in a decadent and gooey chocolate dessert..,"Recently I had the honor of reading an advanced copy (ARC) of Little Fire by Hollee Mands; I was completely enthralled by it! Now this is novel is not meant to be read quickly. Instead, it is to be read slowly as if indulging in a decadent and gooey chocolate dessert in which you savor each morsel, crumb, and bite. Hollee Mands is skilled “pâtissier” who flawlessly builds multi-complex sentences with poetic ease and sweetens the plot with her wordsmithing.<br /><br />The novel spotlights two perplexing characters: Evangeline and Declan. Evangeline was a young, kind woman, a commoner, who aspires to become a healer. Declan, on the other hand, was an Archmage with various lethal powers. Despite being on opposite ends of prestige and social statue, their lives converge when Evangeline attempts to save her friend Stefan who is being pulled into a portal by an Unseelie. Declan hears her cries for help, pulls Stefan from the portal, and grabs Evangeline into his arms as they both disappeared into the portal.<br /><br />At first Evangeline was terrified of the man who came through the portal with her and soon was in shock in this new environment. With Declan unable to use his full powers in the shadow realm that was ruled by Draedyn, he knew it would take Gabriel and his men days to find their location. In the meantime, all he could do was to keep the mortal Evangeline safe from predators. It was this experience which was precipitated their burgeoning friendship. Evangeline had a traumatic and violent past as exhibited in her horrible nightmares. Declan was guarded and mysterious and seemed to manifest a cold-hearted disposition toward Evangeline. The more time they spend together in close quarters in the shadow realm, their rapport improves and trust and empathy begin to develop.<br /><br />How will Declan and Evangeline survive the brutal environment and dangerous predators of the shadow realm? Will Declan and Evangeline be rescued from the shadow realm and be brought back to Amereen? Is there a future for Declan and Evangeline despite their vast differences?<br />Like a master weaver, Hollee Mands intertwines suspenseful plots with a plethora of unusual characters to create a novel that will keep readers spellbound as it maneuvers their emotions through plot twists, bewilderment, shock, and betrayals.<br /><br />Now snuggle into a comfy chair, wearing cozy attire, with your favorite beverage within arm’s reach as you begin a journey into the Five Realms… where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />~~~~~~~ by Kelly Wolf, PhD 10/10/21",5.0,1,2021

3.5 stars from this J.L Drake fan,"I'm a big J.L Drake fan having read the Broken Trilogy several times and revisiting books from the Trigger and Blackstone series too! I love the worlds she creates and the characters in them are ones that I just like to revisit and sit with every now and then.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 3.5 stars is because the story felt rushed to me.<br />I couldn't get a full sense of the world of these characters, often having to remind myself this was set in Italy as there wasn't much in the writing to really place you there apart from names of cities. This is in contrast to J.L Drake's other series were the location really does feel like another character in the book and roots you to the world.<br />A lot of the relationships seemed to be rushed over and not as fleshed out for the reader as I it was for the author. A great shame because I love the worlds and characters she creates.. I just wish we could have lingered in some parts a little longer before rushing onto the next.<br /><br />The jump from younger Sienna, who tried to detract attention from men to protect herself, to then meeting Sienna in the present day doing a cover shoot of a magazine felt discombobulating. It was a tricky leap to make as a reader, I wished we could have experienced along side her how she went from a girl feeling trapped in that house to now being independent and a somewhat successful journalist. It wasn't so much the ""why?"" but ""how?"".<br />It was one of many examples where it felt like large chunks of story had been edited out. I wish they'd stayed in.<br /><br />When initially meeting some of the characters I felt like I couldn't get a full grip on who they were or their place/significance in the story so often times I had to go back when they were revisited to figure out how to endow the relationship moving forward eg. Cara and Sienna.<br /><br />I've already pre-ordered the next in this series and look forward to coming back to this world. Hopefully we get a little more flesh, it doesn't feel so rushed and we can settle into the world a little more but nonetheless I know I will enjoy it because J.L Drake's writing always excites and I trust the journey she takes us on.",3.0,0,2021

This book is the definition of absolute crap,"I loved this series and I would of preferred if this book never came out. Amazon really needs a ZERO Star Option!<br /><br />All the work put into the series was pissed on in this book. The book it self felt like it was written in pieces then tossed together. The ending is just a quick paragraph wrap up just to say it's done.<br /><br />Cole and Sasha fall out. Cole and Srexx don't talk much. Cole marries some no name girl at the end. A new enemy shows up, better tech, and just drops the ball after one battle. You can feel the author had no drive for this book. He shouldn't have published it. The series would of been better off just forever stalled at book 3.<br /><br />Sadly this sours my enjoyment of this author's work. Now I will no longer pre-order his books or buy them till after at least 100+ reviews are left. Almost like he wanted to kill his own reputation with this book.<br /><br />For anyone that loved the first three books, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!!",1.0,0,2021

I recommend this to all 80s kids who loved John Hughes movies.,"I think those of us who grew up in the 80s will have a soft spot for this story.<br /><br />I was at my great-aunt Dorothy's house the first time I watched Sixteen Candles. It was appropriately racy for the time, and I was a tween who thought it was the coolest movie ever. I loved all the Brat Pack movies, but this one was always my favorite.<br /><br />While I didn't necessarily have a crush on Jake Ryan (aka Michael Schoeffling), I still thought this book would be a fun trip down memory lane...and I was right!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...there is nothing high-brow here, it's a simply written novel meant to bring back the spirt of the 80s. It had me laughing out loud a couple times, and those who really know the movie well will see all sorts of little conversations and connections hidden throughout the story. It was a hoot.<br /><br />I saw another reviewer mention feminists not liking this book, but that's simply not true. I'm a feminist and I thought it was all in good fun. Not everything needs to make a statement...especially not books meant to be fun and light-hearted.<br /><br />I recommend this to all 80s kids who loved John Hughes movies.<br /><br />3.5 stars<br />Available January 26, 2021.<br /><br />My sincere thanks to NetGalley and Montlake for my review copy.",3.0,0,2021

I do hope there's a third volume in this series,"I was a great fan of the first book, delighted to learn of the second finally coming out, and now hope that a third book might be in our future...or our past, depending on what the Guardians do.<br /><br />Time travel experiments conducted by the Guardians have had unexpected side effects, sucking people from the past into the present, snatching people from the present into the ancient past, and who knows what effects have yet to be reported.  Most who are taken seem to be isolated people, or groups of military troops in isolated areas.  One Stone Age man found himself in the present with no way to understand what he was experiencing.  There are additional American soldiers and contractors still in the past, and the goal is to bring them home, using the time travel features to bring them back more closely to the time they left so that their lives are less disturbed.<br /><br />Everyone's lives are essentially science experiments when they are drawn into the time anomalies.  The people from the future are using the military unit from the previous recovery to execute this one, as they are familiar with the era, adaptable, and have proven they can do it.<br /><br />They must take care to not disrupt the present or the future, and the troops that are still in the past have been there five years in their time frame, long enough to establish relationships, start a family in one case, and some are experiencing mental issues.  When you've been someplace for years and  have no expectation of ever going home, your outlook  changes.<br /><br />The game of ""What if?"" is played very well here.  Williamson is very qualified to write about military topics and equipment, plus the political implications of how the troops behaved in the past.  Animals that were plentiful in ancient times are now extinct.  The ecology and conservation crowd would go nuts if they knew the time travelers had been eating these animals.  Pass the auroch, please, I want another slice.<br /><br />And I do want another look at this alternate universe.",5.0,1,2021
Eye opening,"This book is 372 pages in length, 31 of those pages are References alone with 21 additional pages in the Appendixes with even more information.<br /><br />Dr. Dunckley's book provides a ton of information regarding the effects of electronic usage on not only a child's brain, but also young adult brains, along with studies and real patient examples, showing how this simple electronic fast experiment, when accomplished properly, can help with behavior and social issues, improving grades in school, even with lessening ADHD and autism symptoms, and improving other issues like tics, OCD, depression and sleep.<br /><br />When reading this book, even the sections that weren't pertinent to us, I only found a few mechanical things, like an extra word, a spelling mistake and a random gap in the text. You can't catch every little mistake and the few that were in this book didn't ruin the flow of reading so much to warrant losing a star. Here are a couple examples:<br /> Kindle: (Page 106; Location 2074) an extra 'the' in this sentence: 'Many screen-related physical ailments are the really the indirect consequence...'<br /> Kindle: (Page 147; Location 2852) misspelled word: one-one-one, supposed to be on, not one.<br /> Kindle: (page 291; Location 5624) gaps between these words: '....technology, and education...'<br /><br />The writing itself was very professional. You can tell that the author knows her subject matter and has a lot of knowledge in her field, and can back it up with all the studies she references. Such as:<br /> Kindle: (Page 58; Location 1126) a study that followed 3,000 children over 2-years and the effects of kids who became pathological gamers versus those that stopped gaming pathologically.<br /> Kindle: (Page 70, Location 1366) another study that followed 3,000 children over 3-years and the correlation between gaming and attention problems, the effect of violent gaming versus the amount of time played and the effects of said issues into adulthood.<br />Some people might find some of the information to be a bit redundant, especially when reading the entire book, not skimming to only the sections you need, but for the most part the information that she is sharing is either expounding upon a quick topic she mentioned previously or pointing you to another part of the book that will provide further detail, such as sections throughout the book about EMFs. Overall, I found the layout of the book very well done, especially considering the expanse of information and research being shared with the reader, and not repetitive at all.<br />Lastly, is this information relevant or can you pass it by and never read it? Yes, it is assuredly relevant, especially with how much people rely on technology in their day-to-day lives, the way it is used in schools and the amount of electronic time we use at home in the form of television, video games, iPads, Kindles and cell phones. I consider it relevant to not only myself but to others as well because of personal experience. I have done this experiment, twice in fact, and the improvements we saw in behavior, subject comprehension in school and grades, anger and sleep have been so amazing and wonderful. We did it the second time simply because of all the online schooling my children had to do this past year and a half due to Covid, hence a reset was needed. Based on my own experience and being around friends and family, I know that this little experiment can help other people and have shared it with that in mind.",5.0,1,2021
"Great cookbook, horribly edited for the U.S. market","If you're at all familiar with Ottolenghi, you know that his recipes are going to include unusual flavor combinations and many of them will involve many ingredients and multiple steps. That's fine. What's not fine is how poorly edited the U.S. edition of this cookbook is. There are ingredients that are reasonably common in the U.S. but are inexplicably referred to by their British names. (For example, what the heck are cavolo nero and runner beans? Turns out they're lacinato kale and Romano beans.) There are baffling quantity transcriptions (a recipe calls for 7 1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice). Metric weight equivalents are given for some, but not all of the ingredients -- small quantities are given only in teaspoons and tablespoons. And, incredibly frustratingly, the cookbook does not follow the common convention of using a capital T for the abbreviation for tablespoons (Tbsp) and a lowercase t for teaspoons (tsp), so it's appallingly easy to confuse the two -- I did that yesterday, with very saddening results (my smoky eggplant cream was overpowered by two tablespoons of Dijon mustard, instead of the two teaspoons I should have added). Ottolenghi is a celebrity chef and Ten Speed Press is a major cookbook publishing company, so I'm baffled that they didn't take the trouble to have the book competently edited for American cooks.

Plenty to Fear,"Actually our flaky heroine has plenty to fear. From n incarcerated father who murdered her mother, a date rapist, an increasingly menacing stalker, keeping up with renovations at her grandparents resort and her childhood crush, now a hunky cop with a cute kid and a psycho ex.  She is a bundle of nerves. Nothing that a few decades of therapy and judicious  use of pharmaceuticals couldn't help. And therein lies the problem of this romantic suspense. You basically have a damsel in distress. She is just annoying.  Although she has the chief of police on speed dial she won't report her rape.

A Handbook for Formation of those in the Apostolate,"This was a favorite book of Pope St. Pius X whose motto for his papacy was ""To extend the Reign of Christ throughout the world."" This extension or continuation of Christ's mission was simply called ""The Apostolate."" This book was like a textbook or handbook for those who wished to participate in this essential work of the Church.

Gazing into the Abyss,"“Sons of War 3: Sinners” resumes the intense and gripping account of the struggle for the soul of Los Angeles in the wake of near-apocalyptic events.  Disastrous climate change… breakdown of the central government… economic disintegration… gang warfare… human trafficking… drug dealing… love and betrayal…  good cop vs. bad cop… all combine to make this novel pertinent to many of today’s challenges.<br />Nicholas Smith has hit another home run with this third in a series of four novels which is a study in contrasts of two families on opposite sides of the law during a time of utter chaos.  One is the Moretti family led by Don Antonio who is determined to eliminate the opposition and become the sole crime boss of LA by any means necessary no matter how brutal.  The other is the Saints, a “band of brothers,” headed by Dom Salvatore.  Dom’s father had served in the Marines before becoming a deputy in the LA County sheriff’s office.  After the death of his father, Dom swore vengeance on those who took his life and to continue the quest to find Monica, Dom’s younger sister who had been kidnapped by human traffickers.  Dom organized the Saints to combat organized crime often using extralegal techniques.<br />Dom is so driven to combat evil that in some instances he crosses the line and does evil things.  In doing so, I was reminded of the famous quote by the German philosopher of the late 19th century Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, “Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.”<br />“Sinners” is filled with mob violence and combat-like action as well as scenes of compassion.  It grabs the reader’s attention at the beginning and continues to the end with enough plot twists and surprises to keep the reader fully engaged.  Smith nails the slang, jargon, and weapons used by groups on both sides of law and order.  Unlike many authors, Smith is not afraid to allow the death of major characters.<br />I highly recommend “Sons of War 3: Sinners” to anyone who wants a change of pace from the usual apocalyptic genre.  “Sinners” will also pique the interest of folks who enjoy crime novels and military thrillers.",5.0,1,2021
A Journey,"I loved this book and will read it again.  It isn’t an easy or light book to read.  You have to be in the mood for it. I felt like I was taken on an adventure to another world with people from India, Ethiopia, Eritrea.  I was afraid the detail about medical procedures and conditions would put me off but it didn’t.  It was fascinating because it was told as a story and the author, Abraham Verghese, WANTS you to understand and learn.  The medical stuff isn’t written to exclude you but to draw you in.  I learned a lot about many medical procedures and conditions.  I had never heard of a vaginal fistula!  Since I read on an iPad, I can look up places on the map, look up the food and photos of locations.  It is a bittersweet story with a lot of sadness.  There is also a spiritual component in just a plain, universal “we are not alone” spiritual way.  I loved how the author always referred to the nun as Sister Mary Joseph Praise – her full name, no nickname, no short cuts.  The twins are fascinating – how they are similar, different, grow apart but still love each other.  I loved Hema and Ghosh.  I’m not a great reviewer.  I just get absorbed into a book and it takes me on a learning journey or it doesn’t.  This was a fascinating and beautiful journey.",5.0,1,2021

Explicit content,I am surprised at the amount of explicit content in this book but I can't protest. It was good and I can't complain. Although the cliffhanger was frustrating and nothing really happens too much in the story. No action packed scenes. The book focuses on too much about wrath and Emilia's struggle against their marriage bond. I had to skip alot of scenes because if was getting boring.,3.0,0,2021
Military Scifi,"First, let me say I love post-apocalyptic Scifi.

This is not that. I figured it was a girl author so I wouldn't have detailed, long winded paragraphs oh weapon type ammunition type hand fighting type. Wrong again. The detailed minution got to me before 20% of the book was read. I didn't finish. So I apologize now if it got better. The first 20% was definitely not entertaining for me.

Good story in desperate need of an editor and better ending!,"Wow—I don’t understand how a seemingly intelligent author (or is it authorS, as in too many cooks have spoiled the soup?) can allow a book to be published with multiple errors in grammar, punctuation, and even continuity (Darcy used his son’s name when talking with Elizabeth, and then several paragraphs later asked Elizabeth what his son’s name was). And my biggest pet peeve (of late) is the erroneous use of the apostrophe. In most cases, adding an apostrophe followed by the letter “s” implies possessive, not plural. Also note there is a difference between complement and compliment, then and than, etc. Strunk & White can help with this!<br />As for the story itself, it’s disappointing that Darcy is such a jerk throughout. And, maybe this is continuity again but he seemed to be redeeming himself about three-quarters of the way through and then went back to being a jerk while talking with Bingley for the final time. I really loved/hated the treatment of Caroline, although a little more “cutting” would have been even more satisfactory. I liked how Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mary, Kitty, and Georgiana were portrayed. And I was soooo glad that Lydia was sent away—I grow tired of her very quickly in all other stories. As for new characters, Henry Talbot was worth knowing and a welcome addition.<br />And then there’s the ending—it got smutty very quickly, which seems out of place. I don’t know for sure, but it almost seemed “borrowed” from another book I had read. Hmm.<br />The author of record seems to have good ideas for variations on Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” but needs to do better, especially with getting outside eyes to review her work before it’s published.",2.0,0,2021
"So so, for me","I’m going to start saying this is the first book by this author I’ve read. I liked the cover & the blurb sounded interesting. I’ve read a lot of books in the past few years, but only a handful of “dark” ones, so I figured I’d check this one out. There are some good parts but there are some things I didn’t care for or felt could’ve been written a little better.<br /><br />SPOILERS INCLUDED….. (sorry, I couldn’t write what I needed to without including some spoilers to explain my rating)<br /><br />First off, this is a dark book with abusive issues (both physical & emotional). I’ve read some books with abuse before & really enjoyed them, but this one was very hard for me to get through in the beginning, possibly because I’ve never had to deal with abuse personally and it seemed realistic. I actually almost stopped reading it a few times but then decided to push though, hoping I’d get to a part that didn’t make me cringe or turn my stomach. I know abuse happens and it hurts my heart thinking about someone going through the kind of life Lily had.<br /><br />I liked Lily and I didn’t like her. I guess someone who’s never dealt with any kind of abuse has a hard time realizing why Lily couldn’t leave the life she was living. I understand her living at home and having to take it from her dad, but when the possessive signs start showing with Trent, bells should’ve gone off in her head saying “hey, something doesn’t feel right here.”  Maybe its because she didn’t know love from being abused by her parents. Maybe she felt that’s how loved ones treated each other because it’s pretty much all she knew. I don’t know, but she was definitely weak and naive even after she’d been hospitalized several times. I was happy when she finally left Trent, to save herself. I really thought he was going to kill her. :(<br /><br />Lily finally took control of her life. She got a job, two actually. Made her own money to buy her own things, something she couldn’t do when married to Trent. She had her best friend back. She made friends at work. She finally went to see a psychologist to work through her issues. She got her drivers license and a car. Things were looking up. I kept thinking something was going to crash down in her world again, holding her back from finding her happy.  (It did, but not til almost the end of the book). I did have a problem with some of the narrative, as it felt immature or rushed in many parts. There were many areas I felt could’ve been worded a little better as it felt like children were talking to each other. Maybe it’s because it’s an older book and I’ve read so many since this one had been published. I don’t know. It does make it hard to read at times when sentences aren’t written right. I will say that some areas had me glued where I couldn’t turn the page fast enough to find out what was going to happen. I also teared up pretty hard when she read the letter her dad wrote. I guess it just broke my heart to know she could’ve had a better life if he would’ve gotten his crap together in the first place and not put her through all that misery.<br /><br />This book is listed as a dark romance, however I didn’t see much romance while reading. Yes she met Max, her savior, but made it clear that she could only be friends. She had to learn to trust others and heal before she could even think about a relationship. He stayed by her side, as a friend, through most of the book because he understood what she was going through. I liked Max a lot, but wish we could’ve learned a little more about him. He was an important factor in helping Lily find her way to becoming worthy of herself. It was a “safe” relationship for Lily, one she became very fond of. The romance came more from Max’s side, as he liked Lily very much, probably loved her from the first time he saw her. He would do anything for her and was there for her any time she needed him.<br /><br />All in all, this book was just ok for me. I’m not sure I’m cut out to read abuse situations as strong as what was written in this book because it just made me hurt for those out in the real world who are possibly going through similar situations. I do think I would’ve enjoyed the rest of the book more if it was written a little better and not rushed a bit in some areas. I am glad I pushed myself to finish instead of stopping before the abuse was over though. It was good to see Lily being able to do for herself and make something of herself in the end.<br /><br />Please don’t take this review as negative. I’ve honestly just never had a reaction like this to a book before and wasn’t sure how I should write my review or even how it was going to come out. I don’t normally put spoilers in my reviews either, but felt I needed to, in order to get out what I was feeling. This is actually probably the longest review I’ve ever written. LOL",3.0,0,2021
One of her best,"As this story begins, Anna is recovering from a work accident. In the ward, she gets reacquainted with her old French teacher, who is very ill with cancer. To pass the time, Claire reteaches French to Anna, and then, when Anna is languishing, depressed over her mutilated foot, Claire makes an opportunity for her to go to Paris and work in the chocolate shop of a former friend.<br /><br />As we learn in a parallel flashback story, Claire was once like Anna, wan and languishing, but she went to France as a young au pair. There, she came alive and found the great love of her life, Thierry. It is to his shop Anna is sent. There, she begins to live again, is challenged over and over, grows, blossoms, and finds love.<br /><br />But this story is so much more than that. In fact, it's the deepest, most sweeping story I remember reading from this author, who tends to write somewhat lighter stories. With rich descriptions of food, chocolate, fashion, and dramatic performance, set in the loveliness of Paris, and as always with characters who are compelling and nuanced, this was one of her best.",5.0,1,2021
Heart & Soul capturing from start to finish. Beautiful story of love and trust/Strangers to Lovers,"Melanie Moreland has captured my heart once again and with a mafia style story! I want to personally thank ""Karen"", a fellow reader for encouraging me to give this one a try as I shy away from mafia genre. It does include a bit of mystery, intrigue and the violence needed to produce the aura of the seedy underworld that it entails.<br />Evie is injured and on the run. She stumbles upon a violent scene and fears that she will lose her life because of what she has witnessed. Of course losing her life would be a lot better than returning to the life she was running from.<br />Matteo is dark and deep and a Killer! When he and his crew stumble upon Evie a decision must be made - kill her to protect their identity or protect her and possibly lose their credibility as fearless and heartless?<br />I must say that someone needed to protect my heart from these characters.

Just lost a little of the magic,"In several of my reviews I've commented that there comes a point where the power level of characters starts to distort the plot and ruin the characters.  This tale started out with the same characters and overall story as the first book, but then there is a jump in power and characterization.  We start seeing occasional interludes that involve deities who are apparently trying to test the lands and the arrival of our hero was supposed to be a unique test.  However, we learn that another deity has secretly violated the agreements and is supplying dark magic somehow.<br /><br />Of course that means that our hero's abilities must take a quantum leap forward, and that the risks and rewards for his actions also increase dramatically, without the characters growing naturally.<br /><br />And that really tore up the narrative in my opinion.  Honestly, this story moves too fast, and has little character compared to book 1.  Some characters are effectively non-entities as they don't appear to have any real agency.<br /><br />It was interesting, but felt empty.  I think Xander lost his original idea in the jump in story and power.",3.0,0,2021

Terrible,"At first I wanted to give this two stars due to Rothfuss’s writing because for the most part, his prose is good if a bit overrated. However, everything else is so bad that 1 star is warranted.<br /><br />One thing that has been brought up in previous reviews is how the main character, Kvothe, is unlikeable. But that’s not really the problem. The real problem is that he is boring. Not just a little bit boring but completely and totally uninteresting. Not only is he good at everything, he is pompous, arrogant, and a know it all to boot.<br /><br />Every other character is piece of cardboard, which is a shame because Rothfuss clearly had to page count to develop them into something interesting. Instead we get endless prattling on about how the main character somehow comes out on top despite getting into serious trouble over and over again. Don’t even get me started on the Bast character. What a completely ridiculous stereotypical worthless character that thankfully, we don’t get too much of. The chronicler is also a complete waste; a blithering idiot that could have somehow contributed to the story had he been something other than a vehicle for showing how brilliant and capable the main character is.<br /><br />Other people have mentioned the unreliable narrator bit. Well if Rothfuss had intended Kvothe to be an unreliable narrator, he did it in the most bland and unimaginative way possible. See, an unreliable narrator only works well if there are some clues or hints in the story that the narrator is in fact unreliable. The main character at one point seems to imply that he is embellishing things but we, the audience, never actually get any confirmation of it. Instead, everything is presented as matter of fact, since there is no one to contradict it. Rothfuss could have had the chronicler catch Kvothe in a blatant lie, contradiction, or exaggeration, but it never comes. Again this was a completely missed opportunity that makes the primary character to be as dull as dirt. By the end I would have found Kvothe a hundred times more interesting had he said: ‘Yeah, I made it up. I really didn’t do most of those things.’<br /><br />As far as the plot itself is concerned, I kept waiting for something interesting to occur but it never did. Things seemed to get interesting when the main character started to research the main bad guys but very little comes of it. Instead we get a boring diversion into the hunt for a large beast that again, is just a showcase for how clever and capable the main character is. This was nearly 700 pages of well, not much happening; at least nothing of interest.<br /><br />I’ve been away from reading fantasy for quite a few years now and chose to make this my return to the genre. I am sorry to have wasted my first foray with this nonsense.",1.0,0,2021
Multi-layered Novel,"Ms Penny's books are so much more than mysteries. They are character studies of the best kind, bring up moral dilemmas, and make the readers think about their own moral compasses. In this latest visit with the inhabitants of Three Pines, Canada is just emerging from the Covid 19 pandemic. A study has been tasked to Professor Robinson, a well-known statistician, to assess the health of the economy and health system post pandemic. Her conclusions are that the weak, the sick, the elderly, the disabled are a drain on the country...her solution, mandatory euthanasia. The book has many layers and a new face in the tiny hamlet. Haniya Daoud, a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize, has been invited to Three Pines. Her story of survival in the Sudan plays a role in the narrative.  Statistics may be correct but not right, as Gamache says. Numbers can be viewed in various ways depending on the emotions and experiences of those analyzing them. I found this book to be both disturbing and thought provoking. I did think that it was overly long and could have accomplished the goal in tighter fashion. The core of the book is meaningful, but the mystery itself seems lost in the moral issues posed. Ms. Penny's books are always first on my list when released; who could not enjoy meeting the Three Pines ""family"" time after time?",4.0,1,2021

"Disappointing, troubling and biased","I've been a fan of Marvel Comics since I started reading them as a boy in the early 70s. I've read thousands of comic books, probably amounting to 80-90% of the comics that Marvel published between 1962 and 1985. I've read many interviews with Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Roy Thomas, et al. and countless articles about the ""early days"" of Marvel Comics. I know, therefore, more than your average person about Jack Kirby's (valid) issues with Marvel and the lack of recognition and compensation he received for his massive contributions to what became the Marvel Universe. Jack Kirby is, without question, not only the greatest comic book artist of all time but one of the most industrious and creative people to ever work in comics. All that said, one can acknowledge those facts while still allowing for the fact that Stan Lee also was one of the most clever, industrious, and imaginitive people to ever work in comics and acknowledge that the Marvel Universe would not have existed without him. Those two positions are not mutually exclusive. The author, unfortunately, has a distinct pro-Kirby bias and it taints this otherwise well done book. In fact, the bias is so blatant that it is distracting, especially when the author makes claims about Stan Lee that are simply not true. I don't know any serious knowledgeable person besides the author who even entertains the notion that Jack Kirby created everything and Stan merely filled in the word bubbles, but that's certainly the distinct impression one gets in reading his description of the early issues of FANTASTIC FOUR. Moreover, if that's the author's position, that's fine (as long as it's supported by the evidence, which I don't think it is), but then come out and tell us that it's your position. Why try to hide it? At least then as readers we'll know where you're coming from. But, while the author doesn't explicity tell us that's his bias, it comes out again and again throughout the text. In the end, I'm sorry I bothered to read this book because its skewed view of the history of Marvel Comics and Stan's participation in it is far less interesting than reality.",1.0,0,2021

Actually I enjoyed the story for several chapters then I was amazed that a Earl's daughter who was a spinster would actually ask for sex at a ton party with people milling about. More than once.

Worse than telling a lie is spending the rest of your life staying true to a lie. ~ Robert Brault,"“A Longbourn Entanglement” begins with a cover-up.  Lydia’s curiosity spikes during Elizabeth Bennet’s proposal from Mr. Collins.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  Lydia’s head ached as she chewed over the implications. No wonder Mama was so desperate for one of them to marry Mr. Collins!  Mr. Collins may not have looked at plain old Mary, but Lydia had caught him glancing at her own bosom more than once.  She was the handsomest of her sisters. She could capture Mr. Collins easily. She had not wanted to, but that was only because no one ever told her anything. And now it was too late. Lizzy had sunk her teeth into him, and in a few minutes, he would be hers.  Imagine being mistress of Longbourn! Lydia began to dream of the possibilities. She would have precedence over all her sisters, and they would need her permission if they wanted to buy a new hat or order a new gown. Why, even Mama would bow to her wishes!<br /><br />To help Lydia secure Collins, Mrs. Bennet interrupts the current proposal by faking apoplexy.<br /><br />All the Bennet sisters must support the pretense that their mother is seriously ill.  This might not be an issue with Mr. Collins, but Bingley and Darcy must also be kept in the dark.<br /><br />One of life's regrets is that you didn't always tell the truth, and now it's too late, because the truth has changed. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet’s illness causes a change in plans for the Netherfield Park residents.  They postpone the trip to London and attempt to aid the Bennet daughters.  Mr. Bennet has departed to visit a friend.  The sisters do not want to call him home since they know there is not an emergency but they run into opposition from their well-intended neighbors.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  Darcy looked grim. “If I were Mr. Bennet, I would certainly want to know what was happening in my own home.”<br />“I would rather wait before sending for him,” said Elizabeth, irritated by Mr. Darcy’s persistence.<br />“We cannot keep such a serious matter from him, surely,” said Mr. Darcy. “What if Mrs. Bennet’s condition takes a turn for the worse? How long would it take him to come back? How far away is his friend?”<br /><br />Honesty doesn't always pay, but dishonesty always costs. ~ Michael Josephson<br /><br />As Elizabeth’s attitude toward Darcy evolves, she feels increasing pressure to confess the truth.<br /><br />How will Darcy respond to a confession?<br />Why does Mary spend so much time with Mr. Collins?<br />Why does Darcy go shopping for lace with Mrs. Phillips?<br /><br />“A Longbourn Entanglement” combines drama and chortles.  The book is well-written, quickly read, and light-hearted.  I recommend it when you need a break from angst.<br /><br />Once an absurdity is accepted as truth, it will seem truer the more absurd it is shown to be. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />I received an ARC of this book with no promise of a review, good or bad.",5.0,1,2021
"Its the ""kidnapped humans in alien experimental dungeon"" tale taken to the stupid level.","I found that once again I wanted to channel Kuni from the old movie UHF and shout ""Stupid!  You're so STUPID!"" at the hero and especially all the people around the hero.  Man were these characters less than compelling due to the extremely dumb decisions or lack of decisions they made again and again.<br /><br />And that doesn't even consider the fact that like 2 other versions of this kind of tale once again the main character is time travelled into the situation with some level of fore-knowledge about what is happening and how to best min/max his skills and development so that he can become increasingly overpowered as the tale advances.<br /><br />Well, I loathe OP main characters and I loathe time-travelling in just about any variation, so this story was built to tick off many of my ""I hate this"" buttons.  Add in the sexual aspects which were forced and as is becoming increasingly common just bland.  I know some readers seem to love multiple long and pointless sex scenes in what are called ""harem"" tales, but for me the lack of any real relationships or character surrounding these zipless joinings makes them less exciting than watching water drops slowly flow down a window.  Heck, watching grass grow would be more interesting most of the time.<br /><br />So yes, I found this story to be hard to read.  It was uninteresting, felt uninspired and had characters that were unsympathetic.  It was the trifecta of bad writing.<br /><br />But, while I can't say anything good about the plot or the characters, I have to admit that the story isn't terrible.  It just lacked anything that would get me to consider it anything better than a basic level ""meh"" tale.<br /><br />If you like harem tales with pointless sex, you'll probably disagree with me and like this story.<br />If you don't mind overpowered main characters, you'll likely disagree with me on the character and like this story.<br />If you can tolerate bad decisions by characters, you'll be able to overlook things I couldn't and might like this story.<br /><br />But for me, its just not one I'll read again, nor will I read book 2.<br /><br />Approach with care.",3.0,0,2021

An absolute masterpiece - no spoilers review,"Whew! What a ride! I didn’t think Weir could possibly top THE MARTIAN but PROJECT HAIL MARY is at least as good and maybe better. It’s got a great plot that starts out seeming somewhat familiar (i.e., last ditch attempt by a united Earth to quickly send up an experimental interstellar space ship to try to fix a “the end of the world as we know it” scenario) but rapidly diverges into something totally original.  The novel employs a time-shifting strategy, with one set of scenes from the past chronicling the lead-up to the launch and the alternates taking place in the “present”, perhaps several decades from now.<br /><br />As with the MARTIAN, there are plenty of twists and turns, and unexpected reveals from start to finish. One of these quite unexpectedly adds a new layer to the plot reminiscent of a “buddy road trip movie”.  The writing is excellent.  The prose is filled with great science including some new physics and biology, and more than a bit of intentional humor. In parts it gets a little “mathy” (but it’s Weir after all) but the nearly 500 page novel flies by in no time.  I usually say more about aspects of the plot but the Amazon page blurbs themselves almost risk spoilers and this novel deserves to be read completely unspoiled.<br /><br />Just Read it.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!!<br /><br />JM Tepper",5.0,1,2021

Having said that, I got the impression this book was written by a pre-teen or adolescent. I see soooo many positive reviews for this book series and I can’t for the life of me understand it. I have my suspicions, but in no way can I recommend this book series.",1.0,0,2021
"Messy, poor grammar","The protagonist's character was wildly inconsistent, so I felt like I never knew her.  There were at least three vividly anachronistic figures of speech in the book and each one felt like getting bucked off a horse.  Hard to refocus after those.  The author also committed the egregious error of using ""inferred"" when the proper word would have been ""implied.""  I thought no author (or editor) would do this.  Pretty disappointed.  The plot was a toil and the twist at the end (the murderer reveal) was underwhelming.  I won't be buying this author again.",2.0,0,2021
Thoroughly enjoyable.,"Middle grade to young adult age mystery, sleuthing, ciphers and escapes, disguises and deductions. I especially enjoyed the cyphers.

Keeps you interested...,"Fairview, CT, is known for many things, but only one thing springs to mind: the murder of a teenage girl. Well, the ALLEGED murder of a teenage girl, for her body was never found. Andie Bell went missing five years ago, and is now presumed dead. Her back-then boyfriend, Sal Singh, was the suspect, and he confirmed his guilt by sending a confession text before ending his own life. Fast-forward five years. Pippa Fitz-Amobi is an aspiring investigative journalist, and she’s going to revisit this controversial case for a high school project. Why? Because she believes Sal was innocent. Pippa is also a mega high-achiever, and she doesn’t stop until she gets all of her answers. It’s all or nothing for her. She also remembers Sal, and how kind he was to her and everyone around him. That is why she interviews all of Andie and Sal’s friends, including Sal’s younger brother, Ravi, who is constantly harassed for what his brother had allegedly done. Pippa doesn’t know what she’s getting herself into. This mystery is far more sinister than she could have ever imagined. So sinister that it brings out the worst in her.<br /><br />THE GOOD GIRL’S GUIDE TO MURDER is an interesting YA mystery in the same vein as Karen McManus’s ONE OF US IS LYING and Kara Thomas’s LITTLE MONSTERS. You have a small town with toxic, narrow-minded townies, several characters with dark secrets and, of course, the woods. The mystery aspect is great, and it kept me interested all the way to the end. I cared about Ravi, and I hoped that his brother’s name would be cleared. Injustice of any kind is intolerable to me, and I was invested in this storyline. Downsides? Pippa. She’s boring, especially during the first half of the book. She gets more interesting as her obsession grows, driving her to do some sketchy stuff, like catfishing on social media. We finally get some characterization about 3/4 into the book, and it’s refreshing. The twists, while surprising, are a bit over the top for me. That’s the thing about YA. You have to up the ante in terms of plot development. It’s one of the main reasons I don’t write YA anymore. (That and the fact that everyone, mostly adults, has a different take on how they think teenagers act and sound, most of which is neither here nor there.) I still like the genre, but in smaller doses. There’s also a disturbing scene involving a dog. I won’t go into it, but I didn’t like it. The book is still readable though. It kept me invested, and that’s a sign of great writing. I give this three out of five pistachio and almond lattes, with a generous amount of oatmilk.",4.0,1,2021
How much longer will they have to suffer?,"Is it a coincidence that I started reading Five Little Indians by Michelle Good the same week we read in the newspapers about the discovery of a mass grave containing 215 bodies of Indigenous children in Kamloops, B.C.? Governments at all levels as well as the Catholic church (although it wasn’t only Catholic churches that ran residential schools) have a lot to answer for. It’s hard to conceive of little children being wrenched from their homes at six years of age because the government and the church assisted by the RCMP egotistically and erroneously insisted they could do a better job of raising them than the children’s parents. Beyond belief.<br /><br />The Catholic church is simply a business that needs to be fed. While professing a higher calling, they need financial support to survive and pay their overheads. Kidnapping and recruiting entire generations of indigenous children to become future followers seemed like it would offer a guaranteed revenue stream. And, because the Canadian government wanted to assimilate Indigenous people into the general population, they were complicit. But the plan was horribly flawed and later generations are still paying the price.<br /><br />Every Canadian is aware of the problems within so many of our indigenous communities. There are shortages of jobs, affordable fresh fruit and vegetables, social problems including, overcrowding, poverty and substance abuse. How can governments allow communities to still have “Boil Water” alerts in place for more than 25 years! We’re all tired of the excuses and impatient to see these problems resolved.<br /><br />Five Little Indians is a fictional story based on real-life recollections, of five native children who were seized from their parents in the late sixties. They were transported to unknown destinations and placed in cruel and despotic residential schools run by sadistic nuns, priests, and religious brothers. The fallout from their experiences affected not only their own lives but those of their parents, their children, extended family, and subsequent generations. The author is of Cree heritage and she relates the stories she heard from her own family to create this moving, compelling novel.<br /><br />Author Michelle Good is a member of the Red Pheasant Cree Nation in Saskatchewan. Good has an MFA and a law degree from the University of British Columbia and, as a lawyer, advocated for residential-school survivors. Her insights, intelligence and experiences with the struggles of indigenous people are first-hand.<br /><br />Michelle Good posted a picture on Twitter with the caption, “That’s my mom in the front row and my auntie in the second row, behind the barbed wire in their holocaust clothes. I wonder how many of these babies didn’t make it home.”<br />The main characters in Five Little Indians, Lucy, Kenny, Clara, Howie, and Maisie meet as children at a remote residential school in British Columbia. Although they are not allowed to communicate with each other, they form a psychic bond through their mutual hate of the facility and their suffering resulting from being separated for years from their families. When they reconnect as adults living in Vancouver’s rough east side, the scars from their residential school experience and separation from their families remain. They cope in different ways.<br /><br />The conditions described in this book are brutal but it is important to read their story in order to gain a better understanding of what these children and their families endured. The horrors did not end in 1996 when the last of the residential schools closed, as former inmates and their families are still suffering the repercussions generations later.<br /><br />Four years ago I read and reviewed (In order to be truly proud, Canada still has work to do) another book, Invisible North by Alexandra Shimo. As a young journalist, she moved to a reserve to experience and further understand the challenges faced by indigenous Canadians. The book was powerful reading and I highly recommend reading it as well.<br /><br />Every day the newspapers print stories of decades of abuse. The Kamloops genocide is just the latest. The plight of young Chanie Wenjack brought to our attention by the late Gord Downie of Tragically Hip is another. There are tens of thousands and the scars remain.<br /><br />How has Canada allowed this to continue unresolved, throwing billions of dollars at COVID relief while Indigenous communities do not have clean drinking water, adequate accommodation or affordable, healthy food?  Five Little Indians should be required reading in every high school curriculum. When you read it, you’ll never forget it.",5.0,1,2021
"Refreshing, Insightful, RomCom","I saw the ad for this on my Kindle, read the blurb, and had to check it out. For me, this book had two layers. The top layer was a fun and cute RomCom with great chemistry between the MFC and the MMC, great supporting cast, intriguing inside peek into the world of YouTube influencers, and a paced out love story. I loved it! The second layer went much deeper, and maybe it's because of the phase of life I'm currently in, or the prevalence of societal issues, or who knows, but I found Tobin's mental hurdle and emotional obstacle to be so poignant, and the disastrous disapproval from his parents to be so profound, that I really connected with his story, and I thought Lily was the perfect foil. Additionally, having been recently diagnosed with ADHD myself, I could completely relate to Tobin ... and I'm a middle-aged white cisgender woman! At a crucial scene when Tobin clearly expressed his boundaries, I wanted to weep. It was so mature and needful, and an excellent example that many of us could benefit from following. Certain characters disrespecting his boundaries were an effective way to propel the plot, and this being a HEA RomCom, the ending was 100% satisfying. I just felt like this book was not only an entertaining and well-written read, but could legit be used as a pattern-card for self-care, boundary setting, and 'how to improve interpersonal relationships'. Well done piece of work. I hope more people give this book a chance, and if they feel compelled to trash Woke language, they need to diversify their friend set. Speaking of diversity, how awesome that the main characters were both Asian! The more I've expanded my sphere of friendships and what I ingest from a social media and entertainment standpoint, the more I've been able to feel empathy for marginalized people. I think art is a wonderful way for people to broaden their awareness, and great books like this are perfect because it's simply a well-crafted love story. There's no preachiness, no patronizing, no condescending, it's just a great story with wonderful representation. This book deserves All the Stars. I can't wait to read book 2!",5.0,1,2021
"a collection of random thoughts, not a book","I wanted to like this book because I enjoyed Krakatoa, for example, by the same author. But this is a collection of random thoughts (or, at best, random essays) masquerading as a book. There are occasional interesting tidbits, but not nearly enough to justify wading through 464 pages. The only unifying theme is that the author wishes rich people were better at sharing (but why would they still be rich then?). The idea that rich people have too much is not a novel one.",2.0,0,2021

The storyline started out well but had paragraphs that were unclear and had to be read several times to decipher meaning.  The story was almost like it was written by different people beginning to end.  Sometimes it felt like the writer was trying to hard to use “big words” and it came across as awkward.

Great box set!,"This series is one of my absolute favorite rom-com series. I love the world that Pippa Grant and Lili Valente created in Happy Cat, GA. The town is as much a character in these stories as the actual characters, and there is such an amazing supporting cast, including just about the funniest menagerie of animals that two comedic minds can conjure.<br /><br />Hosed, Hammered, Hitched and Humbugged center around the O'Dell brothers, and what a group of brothers they are. Swoony, funny, loving, these men have it all. The women that they pair up with are strong, determined, amazing and know what they deserve in life. The extended cast of characters in Happy Cat involve a crime-fighting raccoon, a goose with anger issues, baby goats and alpaca with a strong sense of devotion and loyalty. Plus the other residents of Happy Cat know everything that is going on with everyone in town. Add to it an adult toy factory as one of the town's primary business, and you can only imagine the shenanigans you're going to read about here.<br /><br />Plus this box set has a brand new novella about Savannah and her boss, Colin, whom I've been hoping would have a book since I read Hosed when it was first released. This is like the best holiday president ever from Pippa and Lili because they give Savannah the happily-ever-after that she's deserved for years.",5.0,1,2021
A little far fetched to be believable.,I have  read 3 of Mr. Brody books prior to this book so I had some knowledge of the characters.  It took some time for the story to develop and when it did it just didn't add up  . I found it an interesting story line but as I previously mentioned it was difficult to believe.  I am aware that there may be some criticism that the story is a novel and is not historically accurate and should be read for entertainment value only.  That may very well be but his previous novels  were full of history  and historically accurate information .  I  have many interest so will continue my reading on other subject  and with different authors.,4.0,1,2021
Blatantly bad continuity error early on presaged a story that had no substance.,"Early on our hero Matt is talking via radio with two fellow survivors, however the next day he finds that their house hasn't been inhabited in a week or more and there are also two fresh graves just outside their cabin.  Either he's been hallucinating for some time, or Neil Bimbeau has some serious problems understanding timing of events.<br /><br />But honestly, I expected a poorly written book from Neil.  I've read a few of his more openly erotic offerings and most are juvenile at best.  Sadly, this story clearly fails to be the step up that the description promised.  The characters are harem bimbos with an almost interchangeable personality and the hero is as unheroic as possible.  Add in a silly villain and I can say this is a tale I very much recommend you not bother with.",2.0,0,2021

Too much redundancy,"As a cancer patient I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunatelly I find this book to be a mixed bag. The general idea is great. But there is so much redundancy and repetition that the book becomes boring and confusing. To future readers I would recommend to just pick a chapter or two in the first part and skip the rest. It's the same idea repeated in slightly different words and different examples. Now the second part is about the meditation. This is the part that ""heals"". I am not a good meditator. I have tried many different meditations, but never did well. When someone tells me something like ""visualize a white ball"", I can't do it. This is supposed to be a simple thing, but I can't do it. Let alone to do something more complicated, like place this white ball in my chest. I can't visualize the ball, I can't visualize my chest, and I can't move the ball around. I do not have a control of what pops up in front my eyes when they are closed. But I still try. Some meditations I like, like the ones that ease you into the meditation with breathing techniques. This one in this book is the most frustrating meditation I've came across. There's no breathing instructions, nothing. It immediately start with something like ""sense the space in space"". What? What does that mean? I'm having enough trouble with things I know what they are like ""white balls"". But ""space in space""? What?!?! Frustrating. I do not recommend the meditation.",3.0,0,2021

Amazing memoir - don't miss it!,"Cheryl's first memories are from when she was 4.  At that time, her name was Harbhajan and her family consisted of her parents, her brother Frank and her sister Chiara.  But that's just for now - her family is constantly on the run, changing identities, religions and locations constantly.  All Harbhajan knows is that they are running from her mom's father.  There is a set of rules they must obey and the most important thing is their family.  Harbhjan is always treated as special - both her and Frank are strong athletes and get the best training available.  She even becomes a model and writes a book about that experience.  But as she gets older, she becomes more aware of the grave family dysfunction and realizes that she has no legal identity.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully written memoir.  Cheryl (her chosen identity) has laid out her childhood experiences in an orderly fashion as she grows older and lives in so many different areas.  It's fascinating to go along to all the different locations as you read this book.  We see Cheryl trying to fit in even when she knows she may be leaving soon.  Her place in the family is to try and always make things okay and we see the toll that takes on her.  It's amazing that her con man father treated the family like he did but it is more amazing that Cheryl has come out on the other side with such a strong character and sense of herself.  With almost no formal childhood education, she is articulate, intelligent and wise - more so than most of her family members.  It's heartbreaking to think that she missed out being a kid and a teenager with no worries - this book definitely will make you thankful for your own parents and childhood!  In the vein of Educated and Glass Castle, this is a memoir not to be missed.<br /><br />I received an ARC from the publisher but it in no way influenced my review.",5.0,1,2021

Just Okay ...,"First off, there were too many grammatical errors in this book.  The author's editor did a poor job.<br /> 2nd... the love story between Ben and Lizzie is very vague.  For the life of me... I cannot pin down when Ben started to have such amorous feelings for Lizzie or start to see her as the most beautiful woman he has ever met.  He despised Lizzie's personality and her looks... called her a skinny, scrawny spinster with a pointed chin and a judgmental hypocritical personality.  He only married her to get revenge.<br />Then there was Lizzie ... who was quite boring.  This book was not written very well... and the characters were so underdeveloped.  I gave A Bride For the Prizefighter 5 stars. I loved it.  But this one was dull, confusing and ridiculous.<br />Then came the epilogue... awful ... and unbelievable . This was the part that really killed the book.  The rough prizefighter has become a man who I cannot recognize.  Does he have to kiss her hands 25 times a day? How about the amorous language that they use on each other... where did that come from?  It was unbelievable how this prizefighter ... who is not even champion yet...can afford all these luxuries for Lizzie... We have him giving her beautiful jewelry ... such as a string of pearls, dresses and a live in maid ... because Lizzie never learned how to cook. What does Lizzie do all day in his fancy house located on an affluent street? Also,  The dialogue between them ... just so unbelievable... and corny. Ben sounds like a theatre actor playing a lovesick over-dependent needy teenager.<br /> I am so disappointed because I was waiting for this 2nd Victorian era book to come out... the first one with Will Nye and Mina was just wonderful...

A must for Bridgerton fans,"The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton - Lady Whistledown's Official Guide by Julia Quinn is a delightful reminder of why I love her historical romance series The Bridgertons so darn much!  I need to break out my audiobooks and take a trip down memory lane with the entire cast from beginning to end.<br /><br />Lady Whistledown, author of the gossip sheet Society Papers, is our guide to all the members of the Bridgerton family.  Each chapter highlights a different character.  This includes a new introduction by Lady Whistledown herself, quotes from the character and comments other characters made about them during the course of the series.  It's a reminder of all the familial love and affection, romances and wit that I came to love.<br /><br />It took me a bit to get into the rhythm of the layout of each chapter.  Reading about the first few characters was a bit confusing, and I had to do a bit re-reading.  But once I got the hang of it I was in Bridgerton heaven!  The most heartwarming chapter concerns Violet, the matriarch of the family; she was the glue that held them all together.  Other favorite characters of mine included Colin, Gregory and Hyacinth.  One thing I absolutely loved in the series, and was reminded of here, was the family's brutality in playing Pall Mall.  It always made me laugh, especially the Mallet of Death!  The author made mention of the Netflix series The Bridgertons, but that's not something I'm interested in.  I'm a purist.  I want to see the characters in my mind the way I pictured them through reading.  As we all know, the book is ALWAYS better.  This book is a charming companion to one of the best series of all time.  If you're a fan, you will just adore it.<br /><br />I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.  I received no compensation for my review, and all thoughts and opinions expressed are entirely my own.",4.0,1,2021
I liked everything except the main character,"I’m not usually a fan of mob books/movies, but I just read this author’s WITSEC book and LOVED it so much that I immediately wanted to dive into something else she wrote. While this story is also really interesting and the writing is superb, I found myself struggling to continue reading on multiple occasions because of the female lead. She’s a huge drama queen that goes through insane mood swings and lashes out at everyone. How she managed to live in the “normal” world for six years, I have no idea because she’s legitimately bat-sh*t crazy. Granted, being a mafia princess can’t be an easy childhood, but I really struggled to connect with her or sympathize at all.<br /><br />I’m not sure if this series intends to be a reverse harem like her other series, but there are certainly enough interesting male characters that I wouldn’t be surprised if it becomes one. I do plan on reading the next book, but I’m hoping that our female lead gains some maturity to go along with her temper.",3.0,0,2021

Some information on sleep but way too much other commentary,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I appreciate Smith advocating us exchanging our worries for God's weapons. I appreciate that, while much of this book is about spiritual issues, there are some practical teachings about receiving necessary sleep. I appreciate her teaching about spiritual warfare. This is a book for Charismatic Christians and there is much in the book about demonic spirits and how they act. I like her teaching on dreams, how God communicates through them, the kinds of dreams, etc. I like her teaching about dealing with those pesky voices in our head. I like her emphasis on prayer and appreciated her insight of watching the news as gathering wartime intelligence for prayer.<br /><br />But I felt there are some very odd aspects included in this book on sleeping well. Smith includes much political commentary. She is free about her very pro-Trump views although she prays for all presidents, regardless of party. She believes the claims of voter fraud and irregularities, even mentioning Mike Lindell and his claims. This book seems to have gone to print before the many court decisions against those who claimed voter fraud. I find it odd that someone who advocates insight into spiritual issues was taken in by the false and unprovable claims made by those unhappy with the results of the 2020 US presidential election. I also found it odd Smith mentions her oils and books so often. Having been a retailer myself (owning a Christian bookstore for 33 years) it seemed like some of this book was a sales pitch for readers to buy her other products. But then, she also has a sales pitch for her good friend, Mike Lindell's pillow, and spends pages detailing his story. I found it also odd that she includes much about her ordination as a woman, the criticism and her defense. There is also teaching on the baptism of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues and a section on how the US states got their borders.<br /><br />If you want information on getting a good night of rest, you'll find some here. You will also find material that, to my mind, didn't have much to do with sleeping at all.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher.

"The horrific, hilarious, private thoughts of a new mom","This novel lives up to its provocative title. It’s a feminist exploration of private thoughts that a new mother is not supposed to have, of thoughts a modern woman isn’t supposed to have.<br /><br />Yoder can write not-nice scenes that are offensive on purpose (I think) and yet drive the plot along and suck us further into Nightbitch’s life. Yoder can also write humorous scenes. The women’s herbal sales party is hilarious. We’ve all been to parties like that, amirite?<br /><br />As for any negatives, since Nightbitch is so woman- and mother-centric, I don’t think people who aren’t moms will relate to the story, no matter how good it is. Also, the pace is slow and filled with much inner dialogue. I loved it, but if you prefer an action-packed novel, then Nightbitch isn’t for you.<br /><br />Overall, Nightbitch is a fantastic exploration of what it means to be a modern mom, both the ups and the downs, and the bizarre days, too.",5.0,1,2021

The story is well worth the purchase price but a few things keep it from winning me over,"As noted by other reviewers, the author really needed some editing and proofreading assistance. Simple things like a sentence missing a word or one word (for example) ""principal"" being used instead of ""principle"" crops up quite regularly; other times it is just some awkward sentence structure or word usage in general.<br /><br />ALL THAT ASIDE, Legends of Gilia - Triple Trilogy Omnibus is a good read for the most part. Here's my criticisms of the story:<br /><br />- too many repetitive events: how many times do the members of the party get captured? Too many times, is the answer. The whole get captures and daring rescue things is great but daisy chaining it along through thousands of pages becomes a bit tiresome to the reader. At some point you want your story heroes to become stronger and wiser and more capable but the author seems to have put a cap on that by constantly recycling particular conflicts...<br /><br />- not a lot of variety in regards to character personality types and motivations: snarkiness is very common for most of the good aligned characters it seems and all the ""bad"" aligned characters are fairly shallow but still somewhat more interesting than many of the nicer ones.<br /><br />- for the love of all that is good, please stop having the Dwarf say ""BAH"" before every freaking sentence! Maybe the author is making some kind of inside joke or fun, but it had me start wondering if a artificial intelligence was writing the book using certain ""rules"" instead of an actual human being.<br /><br />Now, back to the bottom line: the story will draw you in and keep you turning pages.

There are no ""wind beneath my wings"" moments, but the value of friendship and sisterhood shines through. If there is a lesson in the story, it's don't run away from your problems.<br /><br />Thankfully, Garvin treats romance as an aside, correctly giving it a third backseat in the story.

Now these same people are standing at the threshold of the millenium, tired, disappointed, dissatisfied and regretful.<br /><br />This novel is a series of Hemingway-esque snapshots of events at the reunion rather than a plotted story. It's a fascinating time period to set this story in.  His characters are lively and active. There's not a cliched or generic one in the bunch.",4.0,1,2021
Unfiltered -Steven Bartlett,"I just finished Steven’s book and I have tears in my eyes. I did not want it to end. I spent the last 2 days reading it and I’m overwhelmed in a good way with everything Steven shared with us, his approach and honesty to understand and find our own fulfillment, love and success. Either if you think you already have it all or you have questions, I definitely encourage you to read this book. It is more than just a book, as Steven calls it “ it’s his intervention “ with so many valuable lessons to take away. Merci Steven 🙏🏼you are a remarkable person with many great skills!",5.0,1,2021
A promising series start,"The author effectively creates a fantasy world in which the light fae and the dark are bound by a compact in their dealings with humans. After a beautiful princess is born to a king and his new queen, the babe is blessed by 3 light fairy godmothers at her christening. When a dark fae appears to curse the child, her teenage stepsister leaps in front of the baby princess, reflecting the curse back onto the spellcaster. The king immediately appoints his stepdaughter her sister's protector. The rest of this book, which appears to be the 1st in a series, deals with Miriam's training in both weapons and magic, acquiring allies (a dragon, a talking wolf, a talking stag, a unicorn, 5 other trainees, & a tribe of gypsies), and preventing a war with trolls. An enjoyable read.",4.0,1,2021
Simply wonderful!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read in my 57 years! I also bought the audio version so I could hear the author's voice which made the content even more delicious.

A fun story with likable characters in serious need of an editor...,"The good : I liked the overall characters and story.  They were fun and likable.  It's similar to other LITRPG works I've read, but unique enough to stand on it's own. I enjoyed it enough to look forward to the next book.<br /><br />The bad : The spelling errors , missing words, and inconsistency of certain words gets a bit annoying.  The characters head into the city of Sea Sattle  (the future of Seattle apparently), but over the course of the book, it's called Sea Sattle or Sea Saddle.  It's as if half of them were auto-corrected.  And there are other's just like that all throughout the book.  In some places words are missing entirely, or repeated right after it's first use... and you are left to fill in the blank to figure out what happened.  With a good editor.. this book could be 5 stars, but right now I'm giving it 3.",3.0,0,2021
Shades of Grey Never Seemed So Bright,"Do you have a favorite series/author you like to listen to their audiobooks? Lousie Bay is mine. It could be because Shane East is often her male audio narrator, and lets face it, his voice makes me swoon.<br /><br />This is the 3rd book in this series of standalones. An age-gap, single dad/nanny romance. Autumn is ever the optimist, filled with singalong sunshine view. Gabriel a grumpy lawyer who has turned cynic after his ex left when their baby girl was only an infant.<br /><br />It took a bit for their chemistry to show itself. For a bit it seemed like she crushed on him from afar and he was annoyed at her teaching his daughter to screech like a cat. I think it seemed a bit more of a disconnect than anything. As time moves on Gabriel catches himself smiling a bit more, wanting to get home a little earlier and thinking about days a little further than tomorrow. The change that Autumn brought to his life is priceless. But every good story needs a hurdle to get over and this one is a doozy. They both find themselves on the opposite sides of where they started, and trying to understand if dreams dreamt years ago are important today.<br /><br />I can't wait to listen to this and the ones that come next.",4.0,1,2021

Where Do I Start?,"Main female character, Ash should have been locked up in an asylum for lunatics. All her hangups and weird fantasies about vampires were tedious, to put it kindly. Her friend, Chastity was equally unlikeable with all her stupid rules. As the main male character, Tanner was hard to figure out, but at least he wasn't a complete flake. The story was incredibly disorganized. The only was I finished this book was by continuously checking my Reading Progress to be sure this story would end. And the worst of it is the story NEVER DOES end. It's a cliff-hanger....for anyone who still cares where the story goes.<br />This book is NOT steamy and is falsely advertised as such. Yes, there are a lot of penises talked about, but no one ever does anything with them.<br />I am taking Ivy Smoak off my ""Follow"" list because I don't care about the follow up to this needlessly long saga. It may be 168,000 words, but at least 68,000 are not essential to the story.",1.0,0,2021
Never A Boring Moment But I'm Totally Confused!,"I enjoyed this book from the very first page, and every page thereafter.  However, I'm totally confused.  I noticed some other reviewers were confused about a storyline, so I went back and read the beginning again, hoping for some clarity.  My theory was wrong, according to what I re-read.  It would have been even better had my theory been confirmed.  For this reason I'm giving this review 4 stars.  I have read some of Sarah Denzil's previous books and have enjoyed them.  Maybe I'll have to drop Ms. Denzil a quick email and she can settle my uncertainty",4.0,1,2021
Heartfelt,"Sometimes, a great story is not about the perfect grammatical structure of sentences, but just to feel like you’re listening to someone telling you a story of a great love over a cup of coffee.  Lou’s story is authentic and you feel the love he had for Nell.<br /><br />I’m about to celebrate 23 years with my life partner, and I know I’ve learned a few tips from Lou about what makes a relationship, a partnership work.

MHI is back with all the characters you love and hate,"The book opens with a stakeout, then a chase scene through Dragon Con and keeps right on going.  If you've read the other books, you are going to find lots of friendly faces and some not so friendly.<br /><br />I won't give you further details on the plot so as not to spoil your reading experience, but recommend that you start at the beginning of the series rather than dive into this one.  You can start your Monster Hunter International book experience with this one, but you won't understand the backstory.  By now there's a lot of it.<br /><br />Evil never sleeps...neither do cultists, reptoids, or Task Force Unicorn.",5.0,1,2021
"Interesting, but I have to repeat a regular review complaint","I enjoyed this book, but... (I know four positive words and then I get into my commentary.)<br /><br />So let me go back to my review for book 1 where I noted the insanity of Colton and his faction that pursued the heroes through multiple towns in order to kill them for being ""pill poppers"" and how that made little to absolutely no sense based on the situation.<br /><br />Well, this book starts with an insane zookeeper who had somehow decided that he had to ""tame"" all the zoo animals following the same pursuit trail and showing up to attack Brad because a honey badger had bonded to him.  And this after that same zoo keeper got his first wolf pack killed trying to capture/kill Brad late in book 1.<br /><br />No<br /><br />Not even.<br /><br />I'm sorry, the explanation that there was a tracking device hidden in the badger doesn't excuse the level of illogic/insanity/stupidity here.<br /><br />the zoo keeper is one man, and I seriously doubt he would have known how to operate any tracking device even if there was one.  Worse, he had a new pack of wolves.  If he's that capable of taming wolves why care about the badger.  It had only been 3-4 days since his first pack got wiped, and he had an even bigger one than before.  Yet, he still obsesses over a single badger?<br /><br />And that is my problem with this series.  The characters are interesting, but often in a frustrating way.  There is just a huge lack of foundational logic in their actions, and I dislike that.<br /><br />but I love the characters and genre, so this is a very low 4 star.  Don't expect intelligent characters here.  They are barely functioning when it comes to logic.  But its still a decent tale.",4.0,1,2021
Fun adventure,"Diverse cast of kids (from Puerto Rico, Rwanda, Nepal, Australia), with unique skills are brought together by an MI6 agent under deep cover to form a unique group of spies.<br />Mostly the diversity shows up in the illustration of each kid at the back of the book and the fact that the writer tells us where they are from. They all read like middle class white American kids, in spite of the fact that most of them were recruited as street kids or foster kids in their home cities.<br /><br />Still a fun read, clean, exciting, interesting mystery for middle grades.",3.0,0,2021
"Some natural remedies for pain, mostly essential oils","""Pain Erasers"" talked about some natural remedies for pain. She focused mostly on using essential oils and strongly favored using the doTerra brand. However, she did have an informative section at the end which talked about making changes in your diet to promote anti-inflammatory foods and remove inflammatory foods as well as suggested some useful supplements. She started by telling her story and then doing short profiles on different types of pain. In these profiles, she briefly described the problem and listed the best remedies for that type of pain. For most of the problems, there was a lot of overlap on which were the best remedies (which is probably good news).<br /><br />She then went into greater depth about each of these remedies. For each profile, she gave the common name as well as the Latin name, a brief history about the herb's use, some scientific information about how it works and how effective it is, information on how to use it as an herb or essential oil, and safety considerations like whether it's safe to ingest and how to safely do that. She also briefly explained other things the herb is good for.<br /><br />In the safety section, she seemed to start with the exact same warning with only the herb's name changed. I thought it was odd that she was so concerned with dangerous solvent residues in the essential oils. Almost all of her suggested essential oils are steam distilled, so the solvent is water. Also, oregano oil is usually the herb steeped in an oil for some time, the herb strained out, and the oil ingested with food. This is not meant to be deceptive (as she implies) as they don't claim it's an ESSENTIAL oil. Even if an essential oil comes diluted in a carrier oil, they should clearly list that on the bottle.<br /><br />I've already been using a number of these remedies for my rheumatoid arthritis pain. I generally felt like I knew more about the essential oils than she did. However, this is a good source of information for someone new to the topic of using essential oils and diet for pain relief.<br /><br />I received an ebook review copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.",4.0,1,2021
Oh man...what happened to this awesome series? :(,This is soo unfortunate.  This book and the couple before were not good.  I dont know what happened with this series but at the beginning it was FABULOUS one of my favorites but when the co-writing started something definitely shifted.  This is going to seem harsh but I just think she should wrap this series up and move on.  The problem with co-writing on something that was a singular authors work for quite a while before its changed doesnt always work well.  Not every time but this time definitely didnt work.  I dont know if they are trying to go in a different direction and we're not understanding or they arent introducing it to us very good.  I dont know.  Is it something she's fazing out?  I mean if the writing is like this I think perhaps its time to call it quits on this series.  I know that sounds bad and I dont mean to be harsh.  I love this series and I am grossly disappointed in the direction it went.  I know my points are valid because I am not the only one who thinks so.  Not everyone agrees and many probably enjoyed it but I didnt.  I do NOT like giving negative reviews but sometimes I gotta be honest and tell how I feel.,2.0,0,2021
"Required Romance Reading, Ladies (and Gentlemen)","I finished reading this really late at night yesterday (the day before?). And I’m in awe of Luce Score’s ability to write such emotional physical scenes that move the story along. Like, 90% of the time, LOL. These two characters have one of the most complicated, angsty relationships ever, and I find it amazing they even got together by the end.  The only other writer I’ve seen come close to this “HOW is she going to PULL THIS OFF!” is Roxie Noir.<br /><br />So yeah. This should be required reading for how to write sex.",5.0,1,2021

Heart-breaking story of a life cut short,"Andrea Wilson Woods has written a heart-breaking memoir of her 15-year-old half-sister's (Adrienne's) nearly five-month battle with late stage liver. This rare cancer is associated with chronic hepatitis B and C infections. (Their mother was a drug-using nurse who probably had at least hepatitis B when she gave birth to Adrienne.)<br /><br />Woods tells her story a day or two at a time. So while she and Adrienne are living the events, the reader knows by the numbered days just how little time Adrienne has left.<br /><br />Woods is a fierce fighter on behalf of her sister. She refuses to allow doctors to give an estimated prognosis. She's discussing experimental treatments with doctors in off-shore clinics within weeks of Adrienne's death.<br /><br />My disappointment with this book is it's single-minded focus on fighting the disease and her refusal to deal with Adrienne's approaching death. She is brutal to doctors treating Adrienne when they don't agree with her desire to use untested experimental drugs. Toward the end of the book I was reminded again and again of Dr. B. J. Miller, a hospice and palliative care doctor (and a triple amputee) in San Francisco. His ability to support patients as they go through the changes of a disease's progress toward death is healing.<br /><br />One never knows how one would react in the same situation. The final chapters of this book are haunting and you'll finish it wishing you'd had a chance to meet Adrienne.",4.0,1,2021
Teeth-shattering,"You guys. Listen. This book hooked me from the front page. If you enjoy the first few pages, you will love the entire book. I truly did not see those events coming... And I was delighted and horrified when they did, every time. The whole time.<br /><br />If the plot is good, the writing is... masterful. This is the first book I've read by MacLeod, and it will not be my last. I loved the phrasing of so many lines... For example: ""the kind of pain that could make a person crack teeth trying to grit through it"" (hence my review title). This book is FULL of that kind of literary deliciousness. It's thrilling, it's suspenseful, it's literary. And! It's smart. Clever, but never pretentious.<br /><br />Five stars, if the above review is unclear. Buy it. Read it. Repeat. You're welcome. (And thank you).",5.0,1,2021
Boring. Does not live up to its hype.,"The best way to sum up the way I feel after finishing this book is...annoyed. I feel like I wasted my time same feeling as watching a D list movie. The book was pretty slow going in the suspense department. I was really starting to get bored 1/2 way through bit figured I would tough it out. Once the action started ramping up, I couldn't stop rolling my eyes is annoyed disbelief. The main character is not believable as some tough smart chick ready to fight and be a hero. She reminds me a an ignorant 20 something year old thag has very little common sense and even less street smarts. She made really unsafe and dumb decisions that made my jaw drop. The whole plot twist was zero percent believable nor was it scary or really all that interesting. This book did not impress me or really keep me all that interested. I only finished it because I paid for it. I would not recommend this to anyone.",1.0,0,2021
Another fun book in this series,"I've read one other of the Spellbound in Hawthorne series and I love the premise. The set up is great. And unique.
