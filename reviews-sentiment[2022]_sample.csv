oh. my. god!,I’ve never written a book review. I know there are people who do this professionally. They outline the book and give AMAZING opinions that I wholeheartedly read prior to buying. Mine will be nothing like theirs.<br />But this book. I couldn’t NOT tell anyone and everyone how amazing this book is. I’m still raw. Knox’s love for both Naomi and Waylay. It was so pure and touching. This wasn’t like most romcoms that are so over the top ridiculous. This felt so real. Please please please PLEASE give me more! Sloan and Lucian ASAP!!!,5.0,1,2022
Worth reading carefully to decide how to proceed with information about breathing,"The 2020 book entitled: “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art” by James Nestor is a most interesting and provocative book that on the one hand is extensively referenced and carefully written but on the other hand, must also be read carefully to capture both the main and subtle points about breathing and how to proceed with “the new science”. Nestor advocates a couple of main themes (Nasal breathing is preferred over mouth breathing and “The optimum breathing rate is about 5.5 breaths per minute. That’s 5.5-second inhales and 5.5-second exhales.”) Nestor provides an entire host of related topics that will be of interest to a variety of different individuals. As some examples: Nestor writes: “They’ve shown lower incidence of crooked teeth and snoring and sleep apnea in infants who were breastfed longer over those who were bottle-fed.”  Nestor goes on to write: “Dr. John Douillard, a trainer to elite athletes… became convinced that mouthbreathing was hurting his clients… Simply training yourself to breathe through your nose, Douillard reported, could cut total exertion in half and offer huge gains in endurance. The athletes felt invigorated while nasal breathing rather than exhausted. They all swore off breathing through their mouths ever again.”<br /> Illustrative of Nestor’s style and substance he writes: “I found a library’s worth of material. The problem was, the sources were hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years old… Seven books of the Chinese Tao dating back to around 400 BCE focused entirely on breathing...”<br /> Nestor writes: “the way we breathe has gotten markedly worse since the dawn of the Industrial Age… almost everyone you know—is breathing incorrectly… many modern maladies—asthma, anxiety,… could either be reduced or reversed simply by changing the way we inhale and exhale…. changing how we breathe will help us live longer… This book is a scientific adventure into the lost art and science of breathing.”<br /> Nestor writes: “even though none of the ancient people ever flossed, or brushed, or saw a dentist, they all had straight teeth… Their mouths were far too large, and their airways too wide for anything to block them. They breathed easy. Nearly all ancient humans shared this forward structure… This remained true from the time when Homo sapiens first appeared, some 300,000 years ago, to just a few hundred years ago… For tens of thousands of years, our ancestors would use their wildly developed heads to breathe just fine. Armed with a nose, a voice, and a supersized brain, humans took over the world.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Mouthbreathing, it turns out, changes the physical body and transforms airways, all for the worse… Inhaling from the nose has the opposite effect…  “Whatever happens to the nose affects what’s happening in the mouth, the airways, the lungs”… said Patrick McKeown… [a] leading experts on nasal breathing. “These aren’t separate things that operate autonomously—it’s one united airway,” he told me… “More wholesome to sleep… with the mouth shut,” wrote… Lemnius, [in] the 1500s who was… one of the first researchers to study snoring. Even back then, [he] knew how injurious obstructive breathing during sleep could be.”<br /> Nestor writes: “contrary to what most of us might think, no amount of snoring is normal, and no amount of sleep apnea comes without risks of serious health effects.”<br /> Nestor writes: “A Chinese Taoist text from the eighth century AD noted that the nose was the “heavenly door,” and that breath must be taken in through it. “Never do otherwise,” the text warned, “for breath would be in danger and illness would set in.”… George Catlin… [about] 1830,.. would spend the next six years traveling thousands of miles throughout the Great Plains… to document the lives of 50 Native American tribes… Having never seen a dentist or doctor, the tribal people had teeth that were perfectly straight—“ as regular as the keys of a piano”… Nobody seemed to get sick, and deformities and other chronic health problems appeared rare... The tribes attributed their vigorous health to… the “great secret of life.” The secret was breathing… The Native Americans explained… breath inhaled through the nose kept the body strong, made the face beautiful, and prevented disease… [then] Catlin… set off… to live with [other] indigenous cultures … Every tribe… shared the same breathing habits… He wrote… The Breath of Life, published in 1862. The book was devoted solely to documenting the wonders of nasal breathing and the hazards of mouthbreathing.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Dr. Mark Burhenne… found that mouthbreathing was both a cause of and a contributor to snoring and sleep apnea. He recommended his patients tape their mouths shut at night… “The health benefits of nose breathing are undeniable,”… Keeping the nose constantly in use, however, trains the tissues inside the nasal cavity and throat to flex and stay open…”<br /> Nestor writes: “Just a few minutes of daily bending and breathing can expand lung capacity. With that extra capacity we can expand our lives… The stretches, called the Five Tibetan Rites… Bradford… studied… and learned restorative practices from the monks. He’d reversed aging through nothing more than stretching and breathing. Kelder described these techniques in a slim booklet titled The Eye of Revelation, published in 1939… the lung-expanding stretches he described are rooted… in actual exercises that date back to 500 BCE… In the 1980s, researchers… gathered two decades of data from 5,200 subjects… and discovered that the greatest indicator of life span wasn’t genetics, diet, or the amount of daily exercise, as many had suspected. It was lung capacity… In 2000, University of Buffalo researchers ran a similar study... The results were the same.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Moderate exercise like walking or cycling has been shown to boost lung size by up to 15 percent… the most important aspect of breathing wasn’t just to take in air through the nose… The key to breathing, lung expansion, and the long life that came… with it was… full exhalation… Singing, talking, yawning, sighing—any vocalization we make occurs during the exhalation…”<br />Nestor writes: “Stough began training his singers to exhale properly, to build up their respiratory muscles and enlarge their lungs… The diaphragm lifts during exhalations, which shrinks the lungs, then it drops back down to expand them during inhalations… A typical adult engages as little as 10 percent of the range of the diaphragm when breathing, which overburdens the heart, elevates blood pressure, and causes a rash of circulatory problems. Extending those breaths to 50 to 70 percent of the diaphragm’s capacity will ease cardiovascular stress and allow the body to work more efficiently… Stough hadn’t found a way to reverse emphysema… he’d [found] a way to access the rest of the lungs, the areas that were still functioning… The benefits of breathing… extended… to everyone… Our bodies can survive on short and clipped breaths for decades, and many of us do. That doesn’t mean it’s good for us. Over time, shallow breathing will limit the range of our diaphragms and lung capacity”<br />Nestor writes: “Stough…  found that [athletes] suffered from the same “respiratory weakness” as everyone else:… Sprinters were the worst off… He warned them to never hold their breath when positioned at the starting line at the beginning of a race, but to breathe deeply and calmly and always exhale at the sound of the starter pistol. This way, the first breath they’d take in would be rich and full and provide them with energy to run faster and longer… The rest of the 1968 U.S. men’s team… [won] a total of 12 Olympic medals, most gold, and set five world records. It was one of the greatest performances in an Olympics.”<br /> Nestor writes: “In 1904, Bohr published… “Concerning a Biologically Important Relationship—The Influence of the Carbon Dioxide Content of Blood on Its Oxygen Binding”… Henderson… like Bohr… was convinced that carbon dioxide was as essential to the body as any vitamin… In other words, the pure oxygen a quarterback might huff between… plays, or that a jet-lagged traveler might shell out 50 dollars for at an airport “oxygen bar,” are of no benefit… “Carbon dioxide is the chief hormone of the entire body; it is the only one that is produced… by every tissue and that probably acts on every organ,” Henderson later wrote. “Carbon dioxide is, in fact, a more fundamental component of living matter than is oxygen.”… It turns out that when breathing at a normal rate, our lungs will absorb only about a quarter… of the available oxygen in the air. The majority of that oxygen is exhaled back out. By taking longer breaths, we allow our lungs to soak up more in fewer breaths… The deep, slow breaths taken… each… six seconds. [by various] cultures… and religions all had somehow developed the same prayer techniques, requiring the same breathing patterns. And they all likely benefited from the same calming effect… It turned out that the most efficient breathing rhythm occurred when both the length of respirations and total breaths per minute were locked in to a spooky symmetry: 5.5-second inhales followed… by 5.5-second exhales, which works out almost exactly to 5.5 breaths a minute. This was the same pattern of the rosary… The results were profound, even when practiced for just five to ten minutes a day… Gerbarg and Brown would write books and publish several scientific articles about the restorative power of the slow breathing, which would become known as “resonant breathing” or Coherent Breathing. The technique required no real effort, time, or thoughtfulness…. Did it matter if we breathed at a rate of six or five seconds, or were a half second off? It did not, as long as the breaths were in the range of 5.5…. In other words, the meditations, Ave Marias, and dozens of other prayers that had been developed over the past several thousand years weren’t all baseless... Prayer heals, especially when it’s practiced at 5.5 breaths a minute.”<br /> Nestor writes: “The key to optimum breathing, and all the health, endurance, and longevity benefits that come with it, is to practice fewer inhales and exhales in a smaller volume. To breathe, but to breathe less… The benefits of jogging were obvious: I always felt great . . . afterward… Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko… spent his youth examining the world around him… Buteyko wasn’t exercising, and yet he was breathing as if he’d just finished a workout… What if overbreathing wasn’t the result of hypertension and headaches but the cause?... In the asthma ward, he found a man stooped over, fighting suffocation, gasping for air. Buteyko approached and showed him the technique he’d been using on himself. After a few minutes, the patient calmed down. He inhaled a careful and clear breath through his nose and then calmly exhaled. Suddenly, his face flushed with color. The asthma attack was over.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Emil Zátopek was experimenting with his own breath-restriction techniques… Four years later he broke the Czech national records for the 2,000, 3,000, and 5,000 meters… Zátopek developed his own training methods to give himself an edge. He’d run as fast as he could holding his breath, take a few huffs and puffs and then do it all again. It was an extreme version of Buteyko’s methods, but Zátopek didn’t call it Voluntary Elimination of Deep Breathing. Nobody did. It would become known as hypoventilation training. Hypo, which comes from the Greek for “under” (as in hypodermic needle), is the opposite of hyper, meaning “over.” The concept of hypoventilation training was to breathe less… Zátopek would claim 18 world records, four Olympic golds and a silver over his career…”<br /> Nestor writes: “in the 1970s… Counsilman trained his team to hold their breath for as many as nine strokes… Counsilman used it to train the U.S. Men’s Swimming team for the Montreal Olympics. They won 13 gold medals, 14 silver, and 7 bronze, and they set world records in 11 events. It was the greatest performance by a U.S. Olympic swim team in history… Hypoventilation training fell back into obscurity after several studies… argued that it had little to no impact on performance and endurance. Whatever these athletes were gaining, the researchers reported, must have been based on a strong placebo effect.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Over his career, Buteyko… had published more than 50 scientific papers and the Soviet Ministry of Health had recognized his techniques as effective… Voluntary Elimination of Deep Breathing was especially effective in treating respiratory diseases. It seemed to work like a miracle for asthma… At rest or during exercise, asthmatics as a whole tend to breathe more—sometimes much more—than those without asthma… The worldwide annual market for asthma therapies is $ 20 billion, and drugs often work so well that they can feel like a virtual cure… The most convincing scientific validation of breathing less for asthma came by way of Dr. Alicia Meuret…120 randomly selected asthma sufferers… then… tracked the carbon dioxide in their exhaled breath… A month later, 80 percent of the asthmatics had raised their resting carbon dioxide level and experienced significantly fewer asthma attacks, better lung function, and a widening of their airways. They all breathed better. The symptoms of their asthma were either gone or markedly decreased… By the end of his career, and the end of his life in 2003 at the age of 80, Buteyko… claimed that his techniques could not only heal illnesses but promote intuition and other forms of extrasensory perception… For these reasons and others, Buteyko and his methods have been largely dismissed by today’s medical community as pseudoscience… Nonetheless… when asthmatic adults followed Buteyko’s methods and decreased their air intake by a third, symptoms of breathlessness reduced by 70 percent and the need for reliever medication decreased by around 90 percent.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Twelve thousand years ago, humans in Southwest Asia and the Fertile Crescent in the Eastern Mediterranean stopped gathering wild roots and vegetables and hunting game, as they had for hundreds of thousands of years. They started growing their… food. These were the first farming cultures, and in these primitive communities, humans suffered from the first widespread instances of crooked teeth and deformed mouths. Then, about 300 years ago, these maladies went viral. Suddenly, all at once, much of the world’s population began to suffer. Their mouths shrank, faces grew flatter, and sinuses plugged… But the changes triggered by the rapid industrialization of farmed foods were severely damaging. Within just a few generations of eating this stuff, modern humans became the worst breathers in Homo history, the worst breathers in the animal kingdom.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Researchers have suspected that industrialized food was shrinking our mouths and destroying our breathing for as long as we’ve been eating this way… The same story played out no matter where he went. Societies that replaced their traditional diet with modern, processed foods suffered up to ten times more cavities, severely crooked teeth, obstructed airways, and overall poorer health. The… modern diets were the same… The traditional diets were all different.”<br /> Nestor writes: “indigenous tribes who suffered through winters when the temperature, according to Price’s notes, could reach 70 degrees below zero and whose only food was wild animals. Some cultures ate nothing but meat, while others were mostly vegetarian. Some relied primarily on homemade cheese; others consumed no dairy at all. Their teeth were almost always perfect; their mouths were exceptionally wide, nasal apertures broad. They suffered few, if any, cavities and little dental disease. Respiratory diseases such as asthma or even tuberculosis, Price reported, were practically nonexistent… Price became convinced that the cause of our shrinking mouths and obstructed airways was deficiencies not of just D or C but all essential vitamins. Vitamins and minerals, he discovered, work in symbiosis; one needs the others to be effective… Hooton called it one of the “epochal pieces of research.” But others hated it, and vehemently disagreed with Price’s conclusions… It wasn’t Price’s facts and figures, or even his dietary advice that made them bristle. Most of what he’d discovered about the modern diet had already been verified by nutritionists years earlier. But some complained that Price overreached, that his observations were too anecdotal and his sample sizes too small.”<br /> Nestor writes: “The problem had less to do with what we were eating than how we ate it. Chewing. It was the constant stress of chewing that was lacking from our diets—Ninety-five percent of the modern, processed diet was soft… It’s all soft. Our ancient ancestors chewed for hours a day, every day. And because they chewed so much, their… mouths, teeth, throats, and faces grew to be wide and strong and pronounced. Food in industrialized societies… hardly required any chewing at all.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Breathing slow, less, and exhaling deeply, I realized, none of it would really matter unless we were able to get those breaths through our noses… and into the lungs. But our caved-in faces… had become obstacles to that clear path… Surgery is highly effective… but… it needs to be done carefully and conservatively… The vast majority of nasal surgeries are successful… [BUT] not all of them.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Having access to more air, more quickly, could only be an… advantage, they said. But we know now that the opposite is more often true… Sleep apnea and snoring, asthma.… are all linked to obstruction in the mouth… Thicker necks cramp airways… body mass index is only one of many factors… CPAPs are a lifesaver for those suffering from moderate to severe sleep apnea, and the devices have helped millions of people finally get a good night’s rest.”<br /> Nestor writes: “When we’re breathing too slowly and carbon dioxide levels rise, the central chemoreceptors monitor these changes and send alarm signals to the brain, telling our lungs to breathe faster and more deeply. When we’re breathing too quickly, these chemoreceptors direct the body to breathe more slowly to increase carbon dioxide levels. This is how our bodies determine how fast and often we breathe, not by the amount of oxygen, but by the level of carbon dioxide.”<br /> Nestor writes: “Sleep apnea, a form of chronic unconscious breathholding, is terribly damaging, as most of us know by now, causing or contributing to hypertension… Meuret crunched the data and found that panic, like asthma, is usually preceded by an increase… in breathing volume and rate and a decrease in carbon dioxide. To stop the attack before it struck, subjects breathed slower and less, increasing their carbon dioxide… “‘Take a deep breath’ is not a helpful instruction,” Meuret wrote. Hold your breath is much better.”<br /> Nestor writes: “The concept of prana was first documented around the same time in India and China, some 3,000 years ago, and became the bedrock of medicine. The Chinese called it ch’i... The more prana something has, the more alive it is. Should this flow of energy ever become blocked, the body would shut down and sickness would follow. If we lose so much prana that we can’t support basic body functions, we die… Western science never observed prana, or even confirmed that it exists.”<br />After careful and extensive pushing the theme of the importance of proper breathing the Nestor provides useful caveats in the Epilogue stating: “A decade of traveling, research, and self-experimentation. In that time I’ve learned that the benefits of breathing are vast, at times unfathomable. But they’re also limited… What I explained to each of these people, and what I’d like to make clear now, is that breathing, like any therapy or medication, can’t do everything.”",4.0,1,2022
A fantastic journey into the how and why of Wok cooking,"This is easily one of the most anticipated cookbooks of the year, and its James Beard award winning author J. Kenji Lopez-Alt is arguably one of the most influential food writers currently in the game. In this book Kenji is exuberant about both the wok and about what he knows and he does a good job of imparting that joy and knowledge to the reader, even if at times he oversells both.<br /><br />I think the real magic of this book is that Kenji has so much personal experience with a wide variety of foods and cooking techniques and he can distill that down  to help the less experienced cook get a feeling for what it is they are about to cook, whats delightful about the food, what pitfalls to avoid, and the tips and tricks they need to know to get an amazing result, and also what tools and methods make it better or easier. So even if you are not a food geek and you aren’t interested in the lengthy scientific discussions that may appear you can love this book. It is really beautiful that you get so much useable information in an easy to read book. You have the recipes but you are provided with a wealth of insight to both make the recipe work, and to give you the skill to improvise and create on your own when you are ready.<br /><br />The book begins by telling you the virtues of a wok with a dash of the hyperbole you find on most food blogs, and then Kenji guides you through his opinion of what wok is the “best” for you to get, how to season, clean and maintain it.  This is followed by a discussion of the tools which are useful for wok cooking, the pantry items you will want to have and the knife skills you need for cooking stir fries and other delicious wok cooked dishes. What I really appreciate is the way he distills things down and simply gives you his experienced perspective of what is good and what is not so good. This is especially valuable to less experienced cooks like me.  Along the way there a sidebars discussing  the science behind the cooking, and there are a metric ton of recipes for you to try everything from stir fries, rice bowl dishes, noodles, fried foods, and braised or simmered dishes (there’s a chapter for each). There is even a section on sides you don’t need to cook that can be served along your newly learned culinary creations.<br /><br />This book really shines because the author is meticulous and driven to thoroughly test recipes. He has a reputation for doing insane amounts of work to justify his opinions through experimentation with lots of different iterations and “double-blind taste tests” with groups of people to pick the winner. I don’t know how much of that was done for this book, but by reputation its a good bet that you can trust these recipes. I’ve tried the beef and broccoli, crab fried rice, and hot and sour soup, and also played with velveting for my own stir fry creation (all pictured). All were great. Also pictured is this book next to the food lab, his award winning first cook book, to show this one is just slightly thinner than the previous effort.<br /><br />What else is to like?<br />* All recipes include one or more picture<br />* Recipes include estimates of both active and total time for the making the dish<br />* Notes are provided for storage and future use where relevant<br />* Both metric and imperial units are given for measures of weight and volume and descriptors are provided for produce such as “12 medium shiitake mushrooms”<br />* You will get more explanations of “why” than almost any other cookbook<br />* It’s Kenji…if you are a fan like I am<br /><br />What’s not to like?<br />* There are some typos or possible errata I’ve noticed (listed at the bottom of this review)<br />* To me it seems like this book was written with a dash too much ego…like the section of the history of woks is one paragraph about the history and 4-5 paragraphs about Kenji. To be fair he said that’s not what this book is about, but its kind of lazy to have a magnum opus about woks and not give it more than than.<br />Another illustration where I would point to this being written with too much ego is that there are no references cited for the facts and figures so it comes across as this is the decree of a ‘food god’ but even things like the densities or specific heats of metals just aren’t referenced. That’s poor form for a book that postures as a ‘food science’ heavy cookbook. There is a list books and websites and video channels, but these are not cited at all as the source of any of the information, facts or figures in this book…at least I didn’t see it if they were.<br />* The index in the kindle version does not provide clickable links to jump to the recipe<br />* the photos and the layout of the book aren’t particularly aesthetically pleasing. It’s utilitarian. It would have been greatly improved by a professional food stylist, photographer and graphic artist. In the price range this book sells for you generally see very polished and pretty layouts. This ine comes across more like a diy user manual.<br /><br />RECIPES<br />I.

Accessible and well researched,"As an avid reader of geopolitical analysis and forecasts, what I liked best about this work is it's easy style, accessibility, and ease of presentation of the material. This book has a better chance of reaching a broader audience than most in the genre. Global civilization is fragile. Demographics alone will produce shocks to the system that will cause massive breakdowns.<br /><br />If I have one gripe, it's that one core assumption, that the United States will largely retreat from the international system that it's built since the end of WW2, is left mostly unexplained. There are plenty of reasons to believe this may be so, but it would have been better to clearly understand the author's reasoning about this.",5.0,1,2022
Perception is reality,"It's true that this earthly life is a simulation. Like David, I've been guided all my life. But my emancipation started with a fluke.<br />When I was so young that my bed was still a crib with rails, I was plagued with 2 recurring dreams, which I came to understand later were the scenes of my death in previous life. I would cry in my sleep, and my parents would wake me up. But as I would seat up half awakened in my bed, the dream would still be in front of my eyes, and my parents would need to tell me that I am no longer sleeping for the images of the dream to go away.<br />So, when still 2 y. o., in a hospital in an unpleasant for me situation, I got up in the hospital crib and, holding onto its rails, I said to my self firmly, ""It's a dream, and I need to wake up"", the time-space reality instantly changed for me, and ever since I was guided to my emancipation. I believe I stumbled onto the great secret of the earthly life then.<br />I had incredible amnt of miracles and "" coincidences "" as well as revelations ( insight not triggered by the present knowledge, experience and awareness) since.<br />But my greatest question has been always why we are here. That question arose in me when I was 13 y. o., and the rest of my life ( I am 60 now) has been an answer to it.<br />So this is my answer to date:<br />Yes, David is right- we live in simulation, presented as an electromagnetic universe, where each of us is tuned to a narrow band of frequencies, dictated by 1. Our state of awarness 2. The moment and place of our ""spawning"" in this computer-like game 3. Our ""itinerary"" in the game.<br />If you understand your human soul as an avatar that keeps dying and respawning in the game Your Spirit is playing, you would get very close to the truth.<br />The reptilians/ Satan/ Lucifer, etc. do not exist outside of the game.<br />But here in the game that dark force is real. I saw it.<br />It's not real on the level of the Spirit that is playing the game though. What's real to us, nothing real in Spirit/ 5th dimension awareness.<br />On that awareness level, we are not trapped in the game, we ARE the game.<br />Once we realize that and get sick of the game, we don't have to come back.<br />Now we are at the point in the game where, this dark force once again is trying to create a simulation in a simulation.<br />Everything that God/ Universal Awareness creates is imbued with consciousness. Consciousness is the Essence of God. So even the dark force is conscious and self aware. David is right - it feeds on our low frequencies of fear and suffering, so it tries to keep us on those frequencies and prevent our emancipation.<br />Here's where he is wrong:<br />We are reincarnating/ respawning, because we are drawn to the game.<br />The game is played to experience the qualities of the Spirit/ Divine Self. How can we experience generosity, if there is no lack? How can we experience courage, if there is no fear? How can we experience kindness and compassion, if there is no suffering?<br />We can only experience lack, fear and suffering due to PERCEIVED separation from God/ our Divine Self.<br />But God is everywhere in reality. We never left that 5th dimension. God is Love in love, Beauty in beauty, Joy in joy. You can feel that presence and that Glory if you tune in.<br />You just need to turn the dial of your perception.<br />Those who took the poison known as  ..ccine would have a harder time to tune in. But it's still possible. Heaven is as close as turning the dial to Its frequency ALWAYS.<br />What drives reincarnation?<br />Our attachments. Attachments are not just love for certain souls/ avatars or things or unsatisfied desires or sense of adventure, etc.<br />Any feeling we harbor for anything in the game, such as hate, resentment, being wronged also binds us to the simulation.<br />If we attempt to fight the perceived evil, we too sign in for the comeback.<br />That's why Christ/ Chrishna teaches us to forgive and turn the other cheek. Brahman incarnates every now and then to help us to emancipate. In Bhagavat Gita, Krishna/ Chrishna gives more detailed teachings. In New Testament, Chrishna/ Christ gives us an abbreviated way out.<br />So David got almost all of it right except that the 5th dimension is already here, and it is the only thing real.<br />In fact, we all are Guided. It's just that so many of us tune that guidance out and focus on the simulation/ the game. Noticing that guidance is the 1st step to knowing how to turn the dial.<br />On His way to Golgotha, Christ said he is going to change the game to make it easier on us. He did. Now suffering is not only food for the dark force, but also the currency, with which we pay to this dark force to be able to tune to a better frequency.",4.0,1,2022
HEAVY ON SEX LIGHT ON PLOT,"Hmmm looks like my review that Amazon approved must have been reported. As I outlined all the use of vulgarity and no plot. I used *** to instead of the words. This must have upset a rabid reader, as my review was number 1 on the review page. So I’ll fix it for rabid readers. SEE HERE I REMOVED THE BREAKDOWN OF BAD WORDS. The first book with less sex between Nyfain & Finley was a<br />lot better. A LOT BETTER. They were actually characters I wanted to get to know.I think Breene pretty much used every dirty word in existence, as I highlighted above;  plus verbs and adverbs to round out the action. Plus everything sexual her imagination could put in a book. OMG nothing sexual is off limits in this book. Heroine even reminisce about her female on female sexual experience, was this supposed to be sexy it wasn’t. Not because it was between two females, but it seemed that they author just decided to throw it in. Then Finley & Nyfain go about acting out sex scenes in romance books. I have to honestly say if you cut out the sex in this book the plot is extremely THIN, and it comes at the end of the book. In fact it’s not a fantasy romance it is a pure sex romp. If I would’ve know Breene was going to just write a sex romp I might have passed on book two; as I expected a plot to go with the sex. Breene can write books with plots as her other books attest. Yes, Breene writes hotter than hell sex; but when the sex is the be all and end all of a story it actually gets redundant. I honestly kept thinking they could be training people to fight, and shore up their defenses if they stopped knocking boots so blasted much. Except for a scene about the other villages and the end the book was nothing but sex.I did read this via kindle unlimited but bought the audiobook.",2.0,0,2022
Couldn’t get into it,"For me this book was just words on a page. I kept dutifully reading them but couldn’t get interested. It frustrates me that chapters bounce back and forth between different points of view but you really don’t have any reference for who the speaker is. It seemed hokie to me that someone is going to get a genetic test to diagnose headaches. The presumed antagonist “Samson” comes across as unreal too “in your face evil” over the top like Chester cheetah “heeey I’m eeeevil!”  Kinda thing. Things happened. I either didn’t understand who or what it was or didn’t care. I gave up reading. It could be just me, so give it a try yourself.<br /><br />I received this book for free as part of the Amazon first reads program.

It's basically a review of YouTube,"I don't know what I expected from this book. It wasn't pages of things she had already said, many referrals back to her YouTube channel and banned videos and absolutely nothing that we've not heard of you follow her. No new content, live sharing secrets. Some personal ""tooting of ones horn."" Some things on God likely to appease the publisher. A lot of hype for what feels like a transcript. Even the layout of the book is unappealing and in list manner. I understand she has many fans that will love anything she says or writes and may not like this review. Or, you're reading this thinking that same thing. She got this book published because of her job and social media status. As someone in the industry without that, you would see this book unless she self published. If you want to reread all her videos with some sprinkles of scripture than this book is for you. If you're in a midlife change and we're looking for hope, ideas or inspiration, this isn't the book. I'm very disappointed and expected so much more from her. I blame her editor, partly.",1.0,0,2022
A coffee geek gives you his thoughts on how to buy and brew good coffee,"Coffee has moved beyond being a luxury to being an essential part of daily life for many of us, but we often settle for lackluster sometimes downright unpleasant cups of coffee at home…just whatever comes out of the machine is what we get. This book promises to provide you insights that will up your coffee skills to have you brewing better coffees, espressos and iced coffees. There is information on buying the best beans, how to grind the coffee, how to brew pour overs, automatic coffees, espressos, iced coffees and cold brews as well as how to buy and maintain the equipment for each. What I find most useful about the book is the concepts rather than the details, because at times his details are inconsistent or conflicting. But the big ideas help you understand what is going on in the brew, which will allow you to experiment and adjust your coffee in an informed way that should have you enjoying better coffee at home consistently. He even includes a section on how to taste coffee. Overall its a worthwhile read, but at times it is pretentious or overly precious about things and even contradicts itself on occasion. So part of what you learn will be coffee fact and part might fall in the realm of coffee mythology, and it will be up to you to do a little testing to see what works and what doesn’t.<br /><br />Here are some things I learned:<br /><br />*  Coffee generates a lot of CO2 gas when roasted (10L/kg beans), and the residual CO2 carried by the roasted bean affects the brew with newly roasted coffee having too much CO2 to make a good espresso (gas coming out of the grounds will make water extraction less efficient).<br />* Fresh roasted coffee should be aged for 1 week prior to brewing, to allow CO2 gas to escape.<br />* The staler coffee is the easier it is to brew or extract, but the worse the flavor profile is<br />* Blooming coffee is not only about getting volatile oils to the surface of the grounds, but also to allow CO2 gas to escape so that the water extraction can be more efficient.<br />* Crema is formed from trapped CO2 in the grounds<br />* Apparently its unfashionable for coffee companies to advertise the roast level of their coffee?<br />* Longer roasts (darker) will increase solubility which in general increases strength of flavor. The bitterness increases but the acidity decreases as roast time increases.<br />* Starbucks lightest roast (blonde) is darker than anything most specialty roasters would sell<br />* Three keys to coffee palate: acidity, fruity flavors, and texture<br />* Plastic pour-over coffee brewers are the cheapest but also beat glass and metal when it comes to heat retention.<br />* There are five taste sensations (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami) but there are other tastes experienced such as astringency, piquancy, spicy heat, and metallic.<br />* There’s something called “swallow breath” where after you swallow you instinctively blow a little air in your nose which allows you to better perceive flavor by involving the olfactory sense.<br />* The perception of flavor involves sequential activation of the taste receptors followed by the olfactory receptors so that the input from the taste receptor can then prime the olfactory sense to more readily discriminate a certain category, like detecting citric acid on the tongue might prime the olfactory sense to more readily pick out citrus-like aromas.<br />* Your perception of flavor is best when the thing you are tasting is closer to body temperature<br />* You don’t plunge the french press to the bottom of the carafe.<br />* Bitterness of an espresso gets more pronounced upon chilling  and upon dilution.<br />* Surprised to learn Hoffman doesn’t own an espresso machine<br /><br />Here are some things I didn’t like:<br /><br />* Can be a little rambling<br />* Sometimes comes across as snobbish, elitist or preachy like going off on coffee varieties without really explaining any meaningful context so it hits as “look how smart I am” rather than “here is something useful to know” or by always suggesting the buyer should spend more, for their coffee or their gear,  or lecturing about how you shouldn’t use bottled water (anyone here from Flint Michigan or Jackson Mississippi agree?, or maybe you have a high arsenic well in India?)<br />* Photos are uninspiring at best<br />* No references provided, the information is just the word of a coffee guru<br />* British spellings<br />* He offers a recipe for making water, which seems to be an extreme level of preciousness for brewing coffee. 2.45g Epsom salts and 1.68g baking soda per liter of distilled water, in case you are wondering.<br />* A good bit of filler, like several paragraphs of discussion of “smart scales” with neither a recommendation for using them or an indication of what possible you could ever need a Wi-Fi enabled coffee scale for.<br />* You can spend “hundreds or thousands” on a hand grinder<br />* The part of the book dedicated to gear you need for brewing coffee does not talk at all about coffee or espresso makers at all, saving that discussion for the “how to brew coffee section” which is organizationally a bit awkward<br />* Step by step brewing instruction section is formatted oddly on kindle. The overview section doesn’t list brew times, and the detailed section has the steps numbered in both the photo and the instruction so each number appears double.<br />* V60 instructions between pour 1 and pour 2 don’t specify at what point pour 2 starts, do you let pour 1 completely clear, or do you add pour two as soon as there is enough room?<br />* Advice sometimes seems arbitrary, for instance the v60 and the Melitta Bentz are treated as essentially the same with respect to how you brew coffee in them, but he recommends a plastic v60 because of the “thermal retention” but for the Melitta Bentz he recommends ceramic because the plastic doesn’t ‘feel delightful to own’ even if the ‘thermal retention’ is better on plastic.<br />* There are three flat bottom filter based units discussed, two of them so similar there is no difference in the brewing instructions, but there is no discussion at all about the Vietnamese Phin system.<br />* He claims that the character of the chemex brew is dependent upon the filter, but in my experience switching to a metal reusable filter for this system I found it makes no real difference in quality at least for my taste.<br />* In his iced coffee section he suggests that 1/3 of the water should be account for by ice so that you only brew with 2/3 the normal amount, but in the actual recipe he uses 2/5 of the normal water amount as ice.<br />* His decision not to include a cold brew coffee recipe is weak given that he didn’t want to “steal” somebody else’s recipe, as if his methods for brewing some other kind of coffee are somehow highly innovative and unique to him. For reference he tells you how to use an automatic coffee maker elsewhere in this book. Weak. In case anyone wants a recipe the following one is from The NY Times Essential cookbook (newest edition blue cover): 1/3 cup ground coffee ground medium coarse, 1 1/2 cups cold water or to taste, milk for serving (optional).  To brew: stir together the coffee and cold water in a jar, cover and let stand at room temperature overnight of or for 12 hours. Strain the brewed coffee through a filter, fine mesh serve or a sieve lined with cheese cloth. To serve, fill two glasses with ice, divide the coffee concentrate between them, add water to the desired dilution and stir. If desired add milk.<br /><br />Neutral observations:<br /><br />*He says you should want to pay more for you coffee for fair trade and sustainability and avoid big brands that work to minimize price. A noble sentiment which may be spoken from a position of privilege.<br />* 40% of the book is making espresso, 60% is everything else<br /><br />Possible errors:<br /><br />* The graph of water hardness/alkalinity lists “ppm CaCO3” as units for both x and Y axis.<br />* He claims distilled water is more “corrosive” to your coffee brewing equipment than soft water, without giving any evidence or rationale how that would be possible.<br />* Essentials section: “Scales accurate to 0.0i g, where the last “digit” should be 1 not “i”, recurring error. Is this a British thing?<br />* When giving ranges of water temperatures for different roasts of coffee, the values he gives in the text do not match those he gives in the inset chart. For instance medium roasts are to be brewed with 90-95C water in text and 85-95C in the figure; dark roasts are to be brewed at 80-90C in the text and 80-85C in the figure.  Assuming both are discussing kettle water temperature as specified in the text, figure makes no specification.<br />* Claims that “plastic has better heat retention than metal” seems dubious. If you’ve ever unloaded a hot dishwasher and had wet plastic items that were cool to the touch but the metal items were dry and so hot they burned your hand, you’ll know plastic probably does not have better heat retention. It may be a better insulator? IDK<br />* “Across its different range” should probably be “ranges” in the V60 section<br />* Text for V60 brewing table says “IMPORTANT: These numbers are the **total cumulative weights, not individual pours” but the table actually provides both per pour weight and cumulative weight.<br />* In how to brew with the Clever Dripper section: “Clever do offer a few variations of their brewer, but I’d just stick with the classic choice” maybe this is correct grammar but it sounds clumsy and could be avoided by structuring the idea differently eg “There are a few different models of the Clever dripper but I would just stick with the classic choice”<br />* Typo: espress-omachine cleaner in the maintenance section talking about automatic coffee makers.<br />* The iced coffee section says to make 1/3 of the normal amount of water the ice, so you only brew with 2/3, but in his recipes he always has you use 2/5 as ice.",4.0,1,2022

Up Close and Personal,"Things I Should Have Said is a brand-new autobiography about the life of Jamie Lynn Spears. She grew up in a small town in Louisiana. She begins the book by sharing how she was the third child of the family. When she was born her brother, Brian was 12 and Britney, was 9. She explained how she was a surprise baby and her dad had a vasectomy and he failed to get the follow up test done. She explained how money was tight for them and she recalls a time a friend of her mother’s had to pay for her clothing at a store and how she felt the humiliation. Her mother owned and operated the Little Red School House. Her father worked on developing businesses and he was good at construction and welding, he owned a restaurant, and he opened up a gym. Her father had one big problem and that was he liked to drink. She revealed how Britney recorded a demo and was eventually picked up by a record label and had natural talent. Jamie also took voice and dance lessons but she cared more about acting. She opened up about how the rise to fame changed the dynamic of their home. She shared how they were all expected to keep Britney happy and her mother would remind her often not to upset Britney. Her parent’s marriage also struggled and they divorced in 2002. They still worked together in business in Britney’s career.<br /><br />In the book, Jamie shared how she was asked to join the cast of Nickelodeon’s, All That. She opened up about her experiences on the show. She also felt that the show created more havoc in her parent’s marriage because they were busy trying to manage both girl’s careers. She also revealed how she was asked to be the lead character in Zoey 101 and how it became a huge hit. She later also shared how this presented challenges between her and her mother. She described how her mother hit her with a purse and how she emotionally snapped at her. She also discussed how she met Casper and eventually had a teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />Another part of the book was the story and relationship of Britney. Throughout the book, readers will get to hear from Jamie’s side of events that happened. Britney has recently made headlines for speaking out about the events and how she claims that some of them are false. She also touched on Britney’s conservatorship in 2008.<br /><br />I would recommend this awesome autobiography on the life of Jamie Lynn Spears to anyone who is eager to hear her side of the story. I have always enjoyed Jamie’s acting in Zoey 101. I remember watching all the episodes as a teenager. I enjoyed reading some of the behind-the-scenes stories. I also appreciated in the book she revealed the story behind her daughter’s scary accident in 2017 involving an ATV for the very first time. I immensely liked how transparent she was in sharing about her life story and her relationship with her parents and Britney. I can see that fame definably added drama and messed up their family relationships. I’m personally a believer in Jamie’s side of the events and that they did in fact happened. Some of the events are very shocking. Readers will be eager to learn from Jamie’s side of things and her own life story.",5.0,1,2022
This book makes you feel hopeful,"There was no preview of this book.  And when I started reading it and figured out what it was about, I didn't want to read it.  And was angry that there was no preview.<br /><br />But then I found the story to be excellent. And interesting. And it really makes you think about yourself and relate to it. This story might just change your life for the better. Anyway, I read the book in one sitting, all night, and recommend the book. It's good, and it could be life-changing if you let it.",5.0,1,2022
The author loves breasts. And cliffhangers.,"The Amazon blurb for Hyperion starts with this: ""A stunning tour de force filled with transcendent awe and wonder, Hyperion is a masterwork of science fiction that resonates with excitement and invention, the first volume in a remarkable epic by the multiple-award-winning author of The Hollow Man.""<br /><br />Wow.  I mean, good grief, how could you not want to read a book with that sort of praise?  Especially if you are a science fiction fan like myself.<br /><br />And in fact, the first third of the book was very promising.  I was enjoying the book enough to purchase the companion audible recording so I could listen to it in my car.  Another third and I was checking Amazon to see if I could return it.  Unfortunately, it was past a week, and therefore my return window was closed.  However, since I hate wasting money just barely more than I hate reading a bad book, I decided to finish it.  And it nearly redeemed itself before falling short again.<br /><br />It is true that at times Simmons is a wonderful author.  I felt like I knew each of the characters, their personalities, and what made them tick.  And at times, the story was brilliant; for some story arcs I could not put the book down.  Others, not so much.<br /><br />You see, the premise of the book, without giving too much away, is that there are several pilgrims on a mission.  During the course of their mission, each pilgrim tells a story on why they have decided to join this expedition. So, the book is mainly six mini-books within a book, each one telling a personal story unconnected from all the other stories, other than the fact that each story is linked somehow to the planet Hyperion.  In other words, there really isn't much world-building going on, or even an overarching plot, if you will.<br /><br />Simmons is one of those authors who feels it is necessary to inundate us with f-bombs. Plus tons of gratuitous sex scenes, some of them dark and twisted.  But even worse, he feels the need to comment on the breasts of every single female he introduces in the story.  Every. Single. One.  No matter the age, whether they be 70, or even 15.  It's sort of creepy, to be honest.  Makes you wonder what's in the guy's head.<br /><br />So, 4 stars for the story, minus one star for misogynistic bent, minus one star for lack of world building, and minus one star for ending the book on a cliffhanger.<br /><br />Yup, you heard it, not a single plot line is resolved at the end of the book.  Just leaves you hanging.  It wouldn't be so bad if you knew that going in.  But nothing I read about the book gave me this essential piece of information.  While I knew it was the first book in the series, and therefore expected some plot lines or story arcs to carry over, I also expected some resolution at the end of the book.  Nope, notta one.  Since then I read that Simmons says the first and second book in the series need to be read as a single story.  Ah, now you tell me.<br /><br />Which leaves me in a dilemma.  I really had no plans/desire to read the rest of the series, let alone the second book. But I have to admit, I have a vested interest now, and am actually curious how the plot is resolved, and what happens to the characters.  So I'm torn between diving into the second book, which I assume will have all the faults of the first, or just cheat and read a plot summary of the second book.  Decisions, decisions.<br /><br />---------------<br />I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between the two sites.<br /><br />5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only 30 in a lifetime.<br />4 - Very good.<br />3 - Worth your time.<br />2 - Not very good.<br />1 - Atrocious",2.0,0,2022
"Good Story, Challenging Writing","I struggle to write this, because at the core there is a good story to be told, and an interesting world to explore.  I also understand the monumental effort it takes to write and complete a novel, so I don't review these things lightly.<br /><br />The story is interesting; however, the actual delivery of the story is an issue.<br /><br />First, it is way to long.  The author expands and explores the protagonist's feelings far too deeply and repetitively.  The protagonist will think about his feelings for page after page, which is okay, but then he revisits those same feelings over and over in the book, each time for numerous pages, without ever seeming to progress.  These sessions bog the book down to a glacial pace at times.  I found myself scanning and skipping page after page of these sections, because they arose so often and were almost always the same thoughts and emotions.<br /><br />Likewise, the action scenes are visceral and full of blood, gore, and blades...but they go on, and on, and on.  Especially the fights near the end...its like reading a Rocky movie; he's down, but gets back up, over and over and over, until he finally overcomes.  The repetitiveness of each fight dilutes what was an interesting clash; by the time the fight ends you really don't care. That may sound harsh, but it is frustrating to see the framework of a good fight, only to have it fall under the weight of its repetition.  Had the fight descriptions been cut by 30%, it would have made a much leaner read that carried much more impact.<br /><br />Second, the protagonist has so many contradictions to his actions and thoughts that it makes it difficult to view him as a true character.  For example, within the first 10 pages of the book, the protagonist is shown to be near un-killable: he is shot through the heart with a crossbow bolt and lives because of his almost magical healing ability.  He also is in possession of a magic dagger that absorbs the souls of those he kills.  But later in the story, he is told by other characters that there are demons in the world and he treats those characters as though they are crazy, insane, and wasting his time. He owns a magical dagger that eats souls, and can heal himself magically, but he doesn't believe in magic or demons?  It makes no sense.  And that thought process still exists after he is exposed to demons and magic; later in the book, he keeps doubting what people are telling him way after he should have accepted these things to be true.  His ongoing (and very long winded) reluctance to accept what is thrown in his face defies credulity and hampers the reader's ability to connect with him.<br /><br />Third, lots of exposition.  There is a lot of history and background shared with the protagonist by other characters telling him stories over and over.  While I did enjoy learning about the world, there are more effective ways of worldbuilding.  The best worlds are built behind the story, as we learn bits and pieces of the past in a fluid, natural way.  These exposition dumps came across almost like campfire stories; lets sit and listen to the character as he shares hours of stories over the crackling fire.  Don't get me wrong; learning about the history and background were one of the aspects of the story that kept me intrigued.  But there are ways to share that information more smoothly and subtly than was done here.<br /><br />There are more issues, but I will end there.  Here's the thing: in spite of these issues, I kept reading because I wanted to see where the story went.  That is the hallmark of a good underlying story.  When I encounter the issues above, I normally just give up and stop reading the book, but this one has something in the story that caught my attention.<br /><br />But, in order to progress through the book, I had to scan and skip entire pages.  The author made it easy; after I had read through a few sections of the protagonist's thoughts, I found I could skip them when those sections came up.  I would scan/skip page after page and then pick up the narrative as it continued.  Because the protagonist never really made any emotional or intellectual progress in these sections, nothing was lost by skipping them.  Likewise, I started scan/skipping pages even during the fighting scenes.  When the protagonist was knocked down, and it appeared he was done, he would always find the rage and fury and with a roar or a scream, he would get back up and continue.  After discovering this repetitiveness, I'd scan/skip entire pages, easily following the action until there was finally a result in the conflict.<br /><br />I did finish the book, and I am glad I did.  I estimate this book could have been really good had it been edited down by about 30%.  As it stands, I am happy I was able to finish it and complete the Hunter's first journey, but I don't know that I'm intrigued enough to continue this expedition into the sequel.",3.0,0,2022

"Rambling, disjointed, disorganized and wrong-headed rubbish in too many ways....","I give this 2 stars simply because it does make one think.  But I wish Child had put more thought into the organization of this little essay, since the end should come at the beginning.  Spoiler alert:  he ends by saying he has no heroes, recognizes none and doesn't trust the concept.  Hmmm.  So he's slipped a gear, since he's for over 20 years created a hero with Jack Reacher, and follows a very common formula for creating that hero, but in the end doesn't even acknowledge that the writers before him who did create our fictional heroes are owed a debt, by him.  If you want a more lucid, well-researched treatment of the hero, in fact the best one extant, read Joseph Campbell's ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces.""  No he doesn't talk about dope in that book, because it's not important to link opium and heroin to the hero, but Campbell is the man if you want to know how writers across centuries and in many languages from different cultures have successfully created mythical heroes.  Child should read that book, and then delete this little embarrassing essay from public view.  It's like him writing an essay on why he doesn't believe in baseball, after letting us know for decades it's his favorite sport, like him saying ""After carefully studying and loving the sport, I posit that the best hitters in the game are in fact not great hitters, and in fact do not exist.""

Bit of a disappointment,"I've been a faithful reader of Jennifer Weiner's and enjoyed all of her books. This one just didn't do it for me and I was surprised by that. WARNING BOOK SPOILERS AHEAD -<br /><br />I think one of my issues with the book was the cliché of not talking to one another and keeping secrets. I know that adds for drama, but when everyone is doing it that's just too much. I also didn't find the characters very likable and they didn't have many redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Eli keeping that secret about his daughter potentially marrying her half brother was just ridiculous! How in the world could he have possibly let them carry on dating and sleeping together with that possibly being the case‽ Even though I knew Gabe wasn't his son that still kind of grossed me out that Eli let that happen without determining for sure if he was Gabe's father or not.<br /><br />While I sympathized with Sarah about her marriage having problems I could never fully connect with her. Maybe if she had been the main character? That also might have been a problem I had with the book was all the different perspectives. I don't mind more than one narrator but this felt like a bunch of little stories all lumped together. With whole chapters telling what happened in the past.<br /><br />The other issue I had was the whole ""I'll tell them later"" thing. That drives me nuts when people just don't talk about things. Not that it would have kept Ronnie from dying but I would be very upset at my parent withholding that information from me.<br /><br />Overall it as an ok book but not one I would read again.",3.0,0,2022

Girls Go Missing - Adults Are Slow to Help,"Author Jess Lourey grew up in Saint Cloud, Minnesota at a time when three serial killers stalked the young girls and women in her terror-filled town.  In her Author's Notes preceding the narrative of ""The Quarry Girls,"" Lourey explains that is why she chose to write a book of fiction based loosely on real life events. Lourey places the story in Saint Cloud in 1976 to 1977 and tells the story mainly from the point of view of Heather, a 16-year-old who is struggling with that painful period ""in between"" childhood and adulthood.  A secondary narrator is Beth, an 18-year-old ready to depart the small town for college when she is abducted and held captive in a small room. Beth's disappearance after working a shift at the diner doesn't raise many alarm bells with adults, other than Beth's parents.  The belief was that she just ran away or left for college early.  Heather explains that in her neighborhood, called Pantown, which was named for a failed automotive company that had built housing for workers complete with underground tunnels to make sure workers could arrive on time when it snowed, everyone seemed to mind their own business and look the other way.  Tough issues were ignored, such as one woman's hoarding and Heather's own mom's mental illness. Despite the bright outward appearances that everyone was so desperate to keep up, many dark and dangerous things lurked beneath the surface.  Together with her two best friends, Maureen and Brenda, Heather formed a girls' garage band. They played for fun and for their parents, but as they got older, they started to draw the attention of local teenaged boys, whose change in behavior from children to teenagers Heather found disturbing.  Why couldn't they all just play together like they did when they were kids without the yearnings of adolescence affecting them all? Indeed, they still engaged in some childish games in the tunnels beneath the company housing, which had always seemed safe, but start to become areas of concern.  Heather was sure she witnessed something quite horrific going on in a basement of one of the homes off the beaten path. Soon after, Maureen goes missing, followed in short order by Brenda.  Eventually, two girls are discovered dead, and Beth is still missing. When Heather's 12-year-old sister is targeted, Heather takes matters into her own hands.  Outside help is needed, because as Heather laments on page 260, ""That's when I understood the raw truth of it: the men in charge were looking out for themselves. We were on our own, the girls of Pantown.""  I've intentionally left out the names and descriptions of some major characters, not wanting to give additional spoilers.  Suffice it to say, I was really disappointed in some of the adults that should have been the good guys. Any book about kidnapping and murder of girls is bound to be depressing, but Lourey makes it suspenseful and serves up some karma to the bad guys.",5.0,1,2022
From Inane to Improbable,"The first 80% of this book are mostly inane Mommy banter - incessant and not very novel thoughts and conversations around new motherhood.

Things did pick up marginally in the latter part of the book, but the climax seemed contrived with a convenient resolution. This book was not suspenseful at all.

"This book doesn't know who the main character is, nor what the plot is supposed to be.","The book meanders.  It contains pages and pages of useless words.  Whole chapters add nothing to the plot.  And there are sections that actively deconstruct characters and send their development backwards.<br /><br />I really struggled to get through this.  I like the basic idea, and in the first couple of books I liked Tyler.  He's an interesting character who manages to be a ""mary sue"" without being completely unreadable.  Or at least he was until this book.  Now with his new Trial Keeper and his worsening indecision he became an active hindrance to the plot moving anywhere.<br /><br />Add in some chapters that just didn't belong as they covered side characters that never reappeared and you had a book that was just wrong.  This one needs major editing, but not just the one book, but someone to start from book 1 in this series and go over to help the author figure out what his end goal is.<br /><br />Honestly, I have to say that David Weber isn't this wordy and prone to introducing useless characters and I have been condemning his books for years for that.",2.0,0,2022
Just... blown away.,"Let me just begin by telling you that I am a *MASSIVE* A.G. Riddle fan- like the hugest. I re-read The Atlantis series every fall. His writing was a much needed reprieve from real life when my mom was dying of breast cancer in 2018 & I was her primary caregiver.<br /><br />With that bias clearly stated, I didn't love the Glass Dessert storyline; I just never felt that magic that his stories invoke & it felt a little rushed at the end.<br /><br />But this book? This book was absolutely incredible. It's so intricate & delightfully complex that I wouldn't even know how to write a decent synopsis style review. So, in lieu of something you could get from the book summary anyway, I'll share what I loved about it:<br /><br />You will never, ever be able to fully predict the plot & in this case, that's a good thing. The characters, of which there are a potentially concerning amount of, all become such well rounded, fleshed out people (which is remarkable given this isn't a terribly long book) and the  ending surpassed all my expectations.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor & commit to the 50% mark.

This is a MUST read!!,"Enthusiastic five stars for this gripping masterfully written suspense story. It’s hard to actually do Justice when describing how well crafted this novel is. A man  of humble beginnings has risen to be a renowned artist only to find his loving and attentive wife has gone missing. In his search for her he discovers that she has written a novel which threatens to expose secrets which would destroy him. Murder, lies, betrayal. A story within a story unfolds. It’s a book you can’t put down. On a deeper level this is a dystopian story about class and the hidden power structures that erode humanity. The outward social veneers we wear disguising our true self to put forward appearances. Questions about who we are vs what we are born into. The destructive power of the lies we tell. This is a real masterpiece. Just amazing! If you liked Parasite or squid game for these dark edgy themes then you will love this. The prose is fresh and inspired. It’s like there is a skewer right through the meaty part of intrigue and the story never falls off this path. And the cherry on top for me was how she describes the world so clearly seen with an artists eye when the the vantage point shifts to the main character. Seriously don’t miss out on this one.",5.0,1,2022
"Well-written, intriguing mystery for young and old(er)!","We are a ""National Parks"" family and have sought out different fiction stories about them. Most of the stories out there are fairly basic, but that is not true about this one! Aaron Johnson has done an AMAZING job of creating a well-developed storyline, an intriguing mystery, and a fact-filled guide all in one - a truly awesome feat. I started reading this aloud to my 12-year-old (who loves books but often isn't interested in reading herself), and when I picked up the book to read the next evening, I found that she had soared through another 65 pages without me! It's a page turner for sure.<br /><br />As a homeschooling teacher for the last 12 years, I will also comment that I found the vocabulary used excellent - it isn't dumbed down for younger kids but also isn't over the top. My 14-year-old and 17-year-old have also read it and loved it - it has the universal appeal that all good stories have!

But more than a few times I rolled my eyes thinking, ""what a Kiss A$$ Anderson is"". He is hugely sympathetic to the new King. Hugely. Diana in particular comes off badly & Anderson even brings up the old ""Hewitt"" Chestnut.

"Where it's good, it's great. And where it's bad, it's awful.","I started this book convinced I'm a Christian Nationalist. I ended this book convinced I am not, at least not if it means what this author believes it does.<br /><br />This book appears to be by a Reformed (Presbyterian) author. Calvin gets quoted a lot, and there's a fair amount of discussion about the elect (those predestined for Heaven.) I've read and enjoyed two or three other books by Reformed authors recently, but this one sealed the deal for me - I have no interest in becoming a Presbyterian. It wasn't only that the author spent far too much time on what I consider unimportant and unknowable in this world aspects of theology.<br /><br />There was also a sense of I'm in but I don't know about you that actually dates back to my childhood. I was raised in a Methodist Church, and the Presbyterian Church had all the rich and professional and politically-powerful folks, whereas we Methodists would let most anyone show up.<br /><br />The author is also a supporter of established (tax-supported) churches, and using state power to compel proper behavior and even church attendance. Having seen first hand just how dead that has made established churches in Europe compared to independent churches, I have no interest in repeating that failure in the U.S. I'm also motivated by the fact that one of my ancestors was hanged on the Boston Commons for the crime of being a Baptist in the Puritan era. (There's now a statue in her honor in front of the statehouse.)<br /><br />My final beef is that the author is opposed to cultural diversity within a particular Christian nation. He's fine with the idea of each culture being a Christian nation, but thinks each must be culturally homogenous for things to work properly long term. In my opinion, folks from every culture will be together in Heaven, so we should get started on that here and now. The only thing that holds the U.S. together is shared ideas, and we should be happy to welcome to our church anyone who shares the essentials of faith. (As John Wesley once put it, ""As to essentials, we think and think alike. As to all else, we think and let think."")<br /><br />That's it for what I disliked about the book. There's also a fair amount I really liked. Specifically, he doesn't hate America, nor me for any of the identity groups in which I might fit. Individuals are celebrated for their abilities and achievements, rather than shunned for their groups being too low on the identity/victimhood index. The last chapter is well worth a read, with lots of good ideas for next steps. In particular he cautions against the usual terms conservative and progressive, as in his opinion neither now represents what we still think it does. Instead, he advocates renewal, with lots of details about what that might look like in practice. If the book had included only that last chapter, I'd have given it five stars.",2.0,0,2022
"Beautifully written, though lacking in a couple of areas (spoilers included)","There were only a couple of reviews for the First Reads novels this month when I made my selection, and based on the positive reviews, I chose Broken Summer. I always enjoy a translated novel and the intertwined voices of author and translator, and this one does not disappoint. Unlike a lot of other translated novels I've read, this one has very few characters and no untranslated place names or phrases, which makes for very easy reading with no skipping over words.<br /><br />This book is a simple but complicated read. I appreciate how efficient the writing is, with no words wasted and a clear absence of ""impressive"" or thesaurus words. Emotionally, though, there's a lot going on. It's a story of two families, once close, torn apart by a tragedy. In the years that follow, unspoken suspicions and guilt linger between and within those families. I wouldn't call this a mystery or suspense novel because I think it's pretty obvious early on that something isn't right with the way the case was resolved, but it's more of a family drama because we see how several of the affected characters coped with the tragedy immediately and over time.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead...<br />In the last 20% of the book or so, I found the plot to be far-fetched. To think that Jisoo's younger sister would devote so many years of her life to following Hanjo's career, marrying him, making him a success, and then betraying him didn't make sense. Is anyone that good at pretending for that long AND also willing to give up all of their late teens and twenties to revenge? Also, the explanation for how Jisoo really died didn't take into account the physical evidence. Whose DNA was on her? If she committed suicide, then that doesn't explain the DNA. The book ended without giving this another mention, like the author forgot about it. This was very disappointing to me, as it seemed to have been the reason Hanjo's father had confessed, and the reader is left wondering throughout the book which son he was protecting. I thought for sure that would be revealed at the end.<br /><br />I keep going back and forth between three stars and four for this one, and I'm going with four: five stars for the beautiful writing/translation, and three stars for a story that doesn't really make sense in the final chapters.",4.0,1,2022
"Really, REALLY problematic (parents & sensitive readers, read this!)","There was lots I loved about this book. The “California Melancholic” setting (a rocky seaside town full of secrets), the way it kept me guessing, the buddy-cop dynamic between two smart girls, and the way rivalry evolves into friendship. The book is well-written and smart, and I started out really enjoying the story and its alternating perspectives.<br /><br />But as the book went on, these two flawed but likable protagonists began to make choices that made them increasingly unlikable. I was so alienated, in fact, by some of their behavior that I considered abandoning the book. But, I really wanted to see how the story wrapped up, giving benefit of the doubt to the authors’ full intent—maybe, I hoped, the two heroines would learn from their choices and become better detectives (and human beings) going forward.<br /><br />Spoilers to follow, because they will be necessary to talk about the elements of this story I found problematic, especially in a story for teens.<br /><br />The Agathas was co-written by two authors, and the chapters alternate between flighty, formerly popular Alice, who has found herself isolated from the popular kids after pulling a selfish stunt last summer, and serious, intellectual Iris, who pals with a clique of roller-rink and forensics-obsessed hipster-stoners (called the “Zoners”). Both girls are complex and deeply flawed; matched together first for tutoring, a partnership soon blossoms when Alice’s ex-bestie Brooke is murdered and the girls together start asking questions nobody else in town seems to be asking.<br /><br />Early in the story, Alice and Iris use a burner phone to send anonymous texts to one of Alice’s ex-friends, Park, whom they suspect of harboring a secret about the night Brooke died. Watching her from a parked car, they send vague, threatening messages to her that suggest they know what she did and are blackmailing her over it. Alice specifically threatens to out her secrets to her dad, relating to Iris that Park is “terrified of her dad”. This works, and the distraught Park confesses the clue that she slipped an Ambien in someone’s drink the night of the party.<br /><br />As Park breaks down and begs them not to tell her father, Iris expresses discomfort that what they are doing “seems kinda mean”, but Alice is clearly enjoying it, and doesn’t stop the harassment even after getting a confession. In fact, she tells Iris the next day that she sent more texts, and justifies her cyberbullying and harassment by reasoning that her ex-clique, including Park, was “mean to her”. Her continued harassment is explicitly motivated by revenge, not the investigation, and not even some warped sense of vigilante justice for what Park did the night of the party. She does it because she wants to hurt somebody who hurt her.<br /><br />While I was willing to accept that this behavior seemed in-character for the (emotionally immature) Alice, Iris’s main arc revolves around the fact she lives in terror of her own father, who is violent and abusive. Not even in private thought does Iris acknowledge some sense of concern for the fact that this other girl is also “terrified of her father”, nor does she stand up in compassion and tell Alice not to send any more revenge texts. This was the first time I began to have an issue with the two detectives.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, Alice and Iris begin to suspect that Brooke’s dad (henceforth called Coach) should be suspect number one. Motivated by the fact that Alice’s ex, Steve, has been pegged for the crime and could face prison time, the girls decide that snooping at Coach’s house is in order.<br /><br />Great! Snooping is a tried and true trope of this genre—one of my favorite tropes. But in deciding how to access the house, Alice whips out a bottle of Xanax taken from her mother’s medicine cabinet and suggests that they should drug Coach in order to search his home.<br /><br />I was a little shocked by the suggestion, but thought surely—surely! This teen book would not have its two protagonists roofie an adult in his own home with stolen drugs from a parent’s medicine cabinet.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Iris is uncomfortable with the idea, but goes along with it. Alice even acknowledges that this is just like what Park did. Um, what?! If there was any sense of justice at all in watching Park suffer emotionally, it was that putting an Ambien in somebody’s drink at a party is a heinous thing to do. Why are the detectives now doing the same thing??<br /><br />Alice enters Coach’s home, crushes up THREE tablets (“they looked small”, she says to Iris) into his BEER, and then they both proceed to ransack his office. Then, knowing he will be confused and to defer suspicion off themselves, Iris takes more beers from the fridge and pours them down the sink to gaslight Coach into believing he just got himself drunk.<br /><br />I literally cannot fathom why this scene hasn’t been mentioned in the other reviews I’ve read. Not only could it be triggering for a lot readers, I hope I’m not the only one who agrees that this is just an objectively awful thing to do to anyone, and that presenting off-label use of any prescription drug as a clever “trick” (particularly combined with alcohol and with little regard to dosage) is an astonishingly negligent thing to write into a YA book.<br /><br />The girls recover circumstantial evidence from Coach’s home, and from there their crusade against him intensifies. The next day, he confronts Alice at school and accuses her of doing something to him and ransacking his home, which they spin into more “evidence” that he is angry and unhinged (ya think you’d be a little unhinged if you got Xanax’d in your own home? I would be!!).<br /><br />Next, they carry out a bizarrely convoluted ploy that involves psychologically manipulating the local donut shop lady, first leaking gossip about their circumstantial evidence to her, then creating a fake profile online just to befriend her, and… honestly I lost the thread here, but it all has the purpose of stirring up the rumor mill on social media, and it succeeds.<br /><br />The case, at this point, is not solved. But the girls, desperate to acquit Steve, essentially spearhead a witch hunt against Coach, which explodes beyond local news and eventually becomes a massively trending hashtag, even drawing protesters to town the day of Brooke’s funeral.<br /><br />At this point I was growing completely disgusted by the protagonists. They rail continually against Castle Cove PD for being corrupt and forcing a conviction on Steve, while simultaneously shoehorning evidence and their own agenda to condemn Coach.<br /><br />Moments in the text do hint that Iris feels vaguely uncomfortable about all of it, so... I kept reading. Surely, I thought, Iris would eventually realize that they had deviated from proper course as detectives and that inciting mob action against a circumstantial suspect is both poor detective work and just generally a bad thing to do.<br /><br />Coach, finally, is arrested and charged with Brooke’s murder, now having had all of his past secrets exposed (it turns out he previously had a wife that disappeared while camping, and had changed his identity once to escape suspicion and scorn that lingered after that accident), and having become a nationally trending object of loathing.<br /><br />The only problem is: by the end, we know Coach didn’t do it. In the case of Brooke’s disappearance, and for all we know about the unsolved disappearance of his wife while she was out hiking, he’s innocent. Sure, he had secrets (some big ones). He had gambling debt. He slept around with various other teachers. But in the end he was nothing but a grieving father, one whose life-- thanks to Alice and Iris—has now been completely destroyed.<br /><br />Maybe now, I thought as the real murderer confessed and was carted off, the girls will apologize to Coach for drugging him, gaslighting him, running a smear campaign to cancel him, and for getting him arrested for a murder he didn’t commit.<br /><br />Haha, of course not. Coach, and the problems the girls created for him, are never seen again. Direct from the last chapter, as Alice and Iris are swanning off to their newfound friendships and happy endings:<br /><br />‘ “It all worked out in the end,” I say. Though I do feel queasy, about Coach. But I mean, what are the chances two of the women in his family suffered strange fates? Is that my fault? Something is definitely up with that guy.’<br /><br />I literally cannot express how much this infuriates me. It appears that this is first in a series, and I can only presume that Coach is intended to be some kind of “big bad” that the girls will continue to harass until it turns out they were right all along, justifying the means they took to get their conviction.<br /><br />Not only does this make Alice and Iris poor detectives, it makes them atrocious role models. The book overall seems to treat adult men with derision, and the mistreatment of Coach almost seems to be justified because he’s a man (can you imagine a book where two teenage boy detectives Xanax a female teacher to snoop through her house?!). I initially loved Alice and Iris (flaws and all) for being two female characters who were strong in their own way, but their utter lack of compassion or remorse doesn’t make them strong female characters, it makes them awful humans.<br /><br />If you’re a parent and you’ve come this far, here are a few more things that bear mentioning: one, the actual murderer (spoiler alert) turns out to be girls’ guidance counselor. In this era, I was a little surprised to see the book go the route of “my counselor is trying to kill me”.<br /><br />As with most YA fiction these days, especially contemporary, the book has profanity and sexual references. Parents and conservative adult readers should know that the book includes various language including the f-bomb a couple times as well as G—D— and several misuses of J—C—.<br /><br />While sexual references are somewhat to be expected in a teen mystery (many secrets frequently predicate on who is sleeping with who), the way sexual content was handled in this book left me, an adult, feeling gross in a way other books in this genre have not. A teenage boy is described as popular because he is “talented”. A teenage girl films a sex tape of herself and shows it to Alice (Alice pushes the phone away). In the text, Iris admits a desire to see the tape, presumably because the boy in it is her crush. An adult woman mentions that an adult man lasts a long time in bed, a detail which I really cannot fathom why it was even included in a children’s book. Iris’s ending includes being texted by her crush, who has really only ever been defined as a pothead “f—boy” (and I quote). I’m not sure why ending up with the school “f—boy” would be a remotely aspirational thing to present to teen girls, but it is apparently Iris’s “happy ending” as the last thing on the last page.<br /><br />Overall this is a well-written, well-executed book with some really abhorrent messaging. Maybe Alice and Iris will continue to grow over the course of the series, but there was not enough growth shown here to promise that—and without any scene of real remorse, the narrative sure seems to be openly justifying all of the terrible things they do to others. I wouldn’t recommend it for adults, and absolutely would never pass this on to a young reader.",1.0,0,2022
"The Unknown Beloved: Decent book, well written, skipped the gruesome - 3.5 stars","I like Amy Harmon, although more with her earlier works.  She writes well but my issue with her later works has to do with the history/times.  I don't like reading about serial killers or mysteries or misery. I read this book because it was written by Amy.  However, I skipped over all the ""true"" details of the story: the victims and how they were cut up. This was a dark book with a tiny bit of love.  I'd rather read a love story that may have a tiny bit of dark.  I bought From Sand and Ash in 2016 and still haven't read it. I don't want to read about Germany, Jews/suffering, WWII, even though the reviews are good, and I know I like Amy's writing. I only bought it because it was written by Amy.  I may need to rethink buying her books, even though some of my favorite books were her earlier works.  I wonder how she can go so deep into the dark truth of history and not have sadness/nightmares? Still, Amy has a talent for writing and storytelling that is better than many authors I have read. (and I read a lot)",4.0,1,2022
"Solid, but flawed light comedy-litrpg","First, this isn't really a cultivation book.  It's  litrpg, as is clear from the use of HP, levels, and similar mechanics.  Cultivation theoretically exists, but nobody does it (so far), and it is still very crunchy - ie, lots of ""31.4 hrs of meditation to next level!"" stuff rather than enlightenment, qi, body purity, etc.<br /><br />Second, it's not remotely xianxa in feel.  This isn't a knock against it, but the setting is a variant of pseudo-midieval-europe (euro-style agriculture, feudel naming system, etc), despite the cover art and some tokens to Japan (the MC's sword)<br /><br />Style is typical Dakota.  Lots of shoehorned humor and overuse of random italics over a generally good story hurt by deus ex events.<br /><br />The grammar+proofing is good, as expected from Dakota.  I only spotted two typos, far below the norm for this genre.<br /><br />Character development is solid.  Grant grows as a person, not just as a character sheet.  Some of his growth is a little abrupt and poorly foreshadowed though.<br /><br />The plot is fine.  There are some minor hiccups and some deus ex moments, but it is generally solid, in the way that Dakota's first few books in a series tend to be.  The biggest problem is how many victories are unearned.  Although Grant does try, he often ""wins"" due to something he had no intention of causing (a Lord self-impaling is the first example of this, but there are many more, such as a system-enforced contract with no foreshadowing).  This is often played for comedic effect, which detracts from the plot.<br /><br />The humor is YMMV.  There is a fair amount, but its mostly physical humor - mostly fat jokes, some poop jokes, etc.  Some wordplay, but most of that is anachronistic or forced puns.  Fine, but a little jarring.  This is a problem because it is a comedy, but if you enjoy that humor, it's fine.<br /><br />Characterization is mixed.  Minor characters don't always act consistently.  Skinny's heel turn is consistent with what we've learned about the character, but his malice is not, and the malice is inconsistent with him changing his mind again.<br /><br />The mechanics are pretty pointless.  Don't really bother paying attention to HP.  It's made clear early on that it doesn't matter for lethal blows (although this rule is violated towards the end of the book), and there's no point at which paying attention to HP helps the plot - frankly, they don't matter, and the point at which characters ""die"" from their minor wounds doesn't make sense.  Likewise, leveling information is inconsistent.",3.0,0,2022
Impressive!,"A history deep-divers delight! Spencer's excellent narrative raised to the power of Kindle-enabled search made the read a two-week real-time history lesson. It's super value for money. Spencer's scholarship and references are the highlights. Loved it!<br /><br />I plan biz itineraries around historical time slices. I've frankly mostly missed this period in my walkabouts. One reason is that so few landmarks and references exist. For me, one glaring example was referenced here, Rhuddlan Castle. I had a biz reason to be in Rhyl, Wales. As I understood, the castle is attributed as a 'second-class' construct in Edward I castle terms. I'm Edward I castle era toured out. So, I skipped the Rhuddlan Castle visit. Spencer reveals my mistake. It was a stronghold player in the Angevin era and was ""rebuilt"" by Edward I. Another 'for instance', Westminster palace is wholly gone. The White Tower, which most believe survives from the Conqueror, was extensively modified over the ages. Only the chapel remains original. The Roman walls on which it was built a thousand years before seem more extraordinary.<br /><br />The Kindle searching rabbit trails drive deeper into Angevin Europe. Definitely a fresh spin on French and English history about to diverge dramatically. Perhaps it's that France even survived is the highlight. It turns Spencer's history into a modern travelogue. Spencer has provided a new itinerary for the history tourista ... I have mine sketched out. But, unlike far more ancient sites, finding the Brit, Norman, and common French past is daunting. Only shadow exists to evidence the whole. With the limited extant shreds of evidence and worse, no story at all for 99% of those who dwelt, I've decided that the Dark Age term pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Does one wonder why the White Ship era comes to us so faintly? Henry I's tenuous rise to power and succession failure seems singularly the most important event for the everyman and a far worse social upheaval than the Norman conquest. The Anarchy that followed plunged the island into a fresh mini-Dark Age every bit as grim as theologian-biased Pagan tales of circa 600-750 (though more recent archaeology suggests otherwise). The Great Anarchy comparatively, socially, geographically, and politically seems to dwarf the earlier Viking era's effects on the island's trajectory. The times are so stark and forbidding, that perhaps it was best forgotten from collective memory, expunged. Better to imagine the Plantagenets and forget the Anarchy of the Angevins?<br /><br />Spencer's handful of voices wrote of kings. Spencer puts real meat on the contemporary's skeleton. Spencer uses the original era place names ... so many changed over the next 100 years that zooming in precisely to the times and places reveals yet another layer to the tale.<br /><br />Made me rethink assumptions.<br /><br />P.s. Buyer reviews influence my buying decisions. I know I rely on them, particularly in the deep-diving history genre. If my review is helpful, please click helpful and let me know. It's reviewer feedback that improves the quality of reviews.",5.0,1,2022

"Brilliant, but repeats previous books","This is the much awaited and much delayed new cookbook by one of the most respected baking guru Rose Levy Beranbaum. This latest work is dedicated to the art and science of making cookies, containing some 153 or so recipes. Rose has immense insight and knowledge and she shares it generously with the reader. You don’t just get the how to, you also get a detailed why the cookie is made this way. She provides deep insights with each recipe, complete with a list of “gems” of knowledge following each recipe. The reason I deducted 1 star is that if you have a lot of her previous works you will have read a good bit of this before. This is sort of like a “greatest hits” album where all the previous cookies are included in one volume, perhaps remastered, and some new ones are thrown in for good measure. So if you don’t have her previous books this is unquestionably a 5 star book. But if you do have all her other books just know a lot of this is material you already own. I plan to study the recipes in more detail to see what is new and what has changed and will update this review.",4.0,1,2022
"Not Life Changing, But a Fun Read","The book was a fun page turner. But I just couldn't get past the inauthenticity of the Bay Are representation. The author has clearly been to the Bay Area before but missed a lot of things that someone who has spent proper time in the area would know.<br /><br />1. SF shuts down early. A hotel bar that's open at 3am? Most close between 11-12.<br />2. How did someone miss that Berkeley is not in SF? No one is driving from Marin to SF for dimsum then to Berkeley for a flea market. That's a big old zig zag of driving back and forth across the bay.<br />3. They live on the water and don't mention the fog? The microclimates would be super top of mind and just something that would be talked/thought about and described regularly.<br />4. Owen lives in Sausalito and works in Palo Alto... so he's driving at least 2.5 a day for work. Complaining about the commute is just something that would come up as a big part of their lives.<br />5. I'm sure that houseboat community is tightnight, but I describing Sausalito as a quaint small town feels like a misrepresentation.<br /><br />Again, I enjoyed reading the book... but the sort of falsified sense of place just nagged at me the whole time. Oh well!",4.0,1,2022
Loved Amy and Hamish's romance!,"From start to finish, this was a wild ride full of humor, heart and heat, and it's great to keep the Jacoby/McCormick family stories going.<br /><br />Amy rightfully thinks Hamish is nothing but an overgrown man-child based on his behavior, and Hamish thinks Amy needs to loosen the reins and give up a little bit of control. And they're both right. They've had a push/pull relationship for years, since Shannon and Declan got married and Hamish tried to pick Amy up at the wedding. But when Amy gets hired to be Hamish's ""handler"" to keep him in line, the sparks between the two of them explode.<br /><br />The growth of these two characters throughout this book is so well developed. Neither of them changes overnight, and neither of them changes against their will. They grow together because of each other's support, because of their shared experiences, and because they can be themselves with each other. I loved how they truly lifted each other up and wanted happiness for the other.<br /><br />Julia Kent has delivered another knock-out hit in the Shopping Universe, full of all of the humor and heart that you expect from the Jacoby and McCormick families.",5.0,1,2022
Mind Blown!! (Library Loan),"This was well worth being on the waiting list for it, until it became available. The characters, the environment, the plot, each one comprehensively elaborated upon. You pick up on every nuance and quirk of the 4 main characters, and are able to put forth a strong image in your mind as to what they look like, and who and what their dispositions and temperaments are made up of. As well as their surroundings, living quarters, eateries, etc. The embedded, seemingly tiny, daily trivialities, immerses the reader into gratfylingly experiencing it all.<br /><br />The Who-Dunnit element had me going back and forth quite a few times. The innocence of one ""suspect"" I never really emphatically questioned. I had the same faith in him the main character did. The rest of the possible persons of interest, I did capitulate, quite frequently, from side to side a number of times.<br /><br />Just when you thought substantial rationale has been presented to solidify who you were locked in on, the distrust and uncertainty began to surface, and you were no longer looking at X person, but rather now at person Y, only to wonder if maybe it was Z after all.<br /><br />One of the most enticing parts of the book, at least for myself, is there's actually 2 stories, or plot lines, going on at the time. You don't realize it until it explodes forth in a way which you never see advancing and it extremely, without warning, accelerates. It's only addressed for a couple of pages at the beginning and /or end of the chapters, so you don't comprehend what's about to sneak up on you, until it's well into the novel. Remarkably ingenious style of weaving this entirely self-contained plot, abtrusely inside the central plot.<br /><br />Very enjoyable read, and would highly recommend to anyone looking for an immersive storyline, which is light-hearted enough to read through in a sitting or two, but cryptic and obscure enough to hold your attention.<br /><br />The only thing which caught me off a bit, was the proofreading. For this being professionally released with a publisher, editor, agent, etc., it was quite jarring when almost 3/4's of the way through the book, it was suddenly laden with typographical and grammatical errors. It seemed as if the last section was just entirely skipped over. It's very jarring as a reader when there's errors. It pulls you out of the storyline and shifts the focus. Seems more and more the excepted norm in today's e-book world, and mass flooding of self-published. Not so much in a professional release, so I'm just curious as to what happened.",4.0,1,2022
Pros and cons,"I couldn't find an extra First Reads that sounded interesting so I selected this. I didn't get tthe point of it. Oh, sure I got the idea someone was trying to find a gift for a friend that had to be just right or it wouldn't be good enough. That's a terrible idea to plant in a child's mind, but unfortunately that is the way much of the world thinks. I DID like the way that was handled when the gifts were exchanged. However, I didn't understand why anyone was giving anyone else a gift. At first I thought someone was having a birthday since everyone seemed to have a gift or was looking for a gift. Then the two (I assume) bears exchanged gifts. Clearly one of them wasn't having a birthday because when he received the gift, he gave one back. That didn't make any sense.<br /><br />Even more disturbing was the fact that when the two bears exchanged gifts, the other characters wanted to know what gifts they'd gotten for THEM! Huh? You don't ask people to give you gifts! Is that really what we want to teach our children? There are enough rude people in this world. We certainly don't need to create more of them and ESPECIALLY not from our children! That's just nuts!<br /><br />If someone has a clue why anyone was giving gifts, you're ahead of the game. I have no idea what that was supposed to be. But I DO know the message that the gifts were well received is an important thing for children to understand. While I didn't like asking for gifts, I did like being very appreciative of the gifts we are given. THAT was a great message. So I have some positive and some negative thoughts about this story. Makes it a middle of the road star count for me.",3.0,0,2022
Unfortunately repetitive,"***Some slight spoilers***<br /><br />I’m actually coming back to write this review after reading about half of book two. I was originally going to rate this one at three stars, but I’ve just realized how ridiculously repetitive these books are and can’t rate it higher than two.<br /><br />The main character is Rowan, who has lost her sister and her adoptive parents have turned neglectful and abusive since they blame Rowan for their birth daughter’s death. Now, granted, this is some traumatizing stuff, but I quickly got sick of Rowan “sobbing” all the time. Seriously, I feel like she spent 75% of this book crying, and she’s still constantly doing it in book two. More than anything else, this girl needs a therapist and some anti-depressants.<br /><br />Speaking of that, this book and the next are so repetitive. Someone will say or do something mean to Rowan, she runs off to cry, the guys come to comfort her, and then the cycle starts over. Over and over again everyone says how strong and powerful she is, but it’s certainly never demonstrated.<br /><br />I wasn’t thrilled with the guys either. Rowan is constantly bullied at school by some of their exes, but they never do anything about it other than glare a lot. Holden is supposed to be student council president, but he certainly takes no stance on bullying. Rowan just has to put up with it (while crying of course). Also, Vaughn is just a flat out jerk most of the time too.<br /><br />I’d have preferred these characters to be more new adult age (didn’t realize they were 17 at first), but I usually just mentally age up characters in my head if I need to. I really struggled with that here because I just think they were all really immature.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this one higher, but I’m not going back to finish book two at this point. Hopefully Rowan will eventually get a thicker skin, but at this point I’ve had enough of the crying fits that I have no interest in sticking around to find out.",2.0,0,2022
"terrific world building, too many POVs, too choppy a narrative","Rating: 3.5🌈<br /><br />I’ve been eagerly anticipating this story as this author’s previous series have been enormous hits with me.  But almost immediately I was struggling to finish this book which was written in a different format from the author’s books.<br /><br />In a  nutshell, it’s wordy, dry, very dense, narratively overwhelming with too many characters. And, while imaginative, it’s format of a huge amount of POVs makes it almost impossible to connect with or even follow all the many plot lines.<br /><br />Turner is clearly striving for that epic cast of hundreds type of fantasy steampunk adventure.  Where masses of characters come streaming over the horizon, raiding trains, pour out over airships, massive explosive battles., capturing castles. Thousands die by magical blasts , bodies flying through the air.  Add in poison, in every form, and revenants. Aka The walking dead.<br /><br />This book has wonderful ideas about world building.  Massive amounts of information about the kingdoms, countries, and even the planet Maricol. All as told to.<br /><br />The rating is for all the imaginative details and world building.<br /><br />What I’m missing is what I love about her other novels.  That’s her characters , the depth of personality, their relationship and growing dynamics with other characters. Main characters.  People who counted.  I miss caring about anyone. I miss the great dialogue.  .<br /><br />Here , the Gods who pulls all the narrative strings, so to speak, have no emotions, their eternal lifespan having removed that pesky thing.<br /><br />So people start dying immediately.  Children, adults.  I’d say don’t get attached but the reader doesn’t spend enough time with anyone to generate enough emotion to become invested in the lives here.<br /><br />More like, huh, poisoned. Oh, revenant got him.  Yes, zombies .<br /><br />There’s a staggering amount of POVs, over 14 I believe.  That’s  not counting all the tons of characters that get mentioned or have dialogue.  The size of the cast here is mind boggling.  And you get them all immediately, well,  a lot of them.<br /><br />With an ever increasingly dense and expanding universe that the author adds layer upon layer of complicated mythology and political world building as the story moves forward, it’s a wonder that any reader can maintain a idea of what’s happening within the storylines let alone have any meaningful connection to it.<br /><br />You basically need a Epic Steampunk Fantasy version of a murder board to keep track of everything and everyone’s relationships.  That includes the “Star  Gods” , who have their own warped dynamics going on. Then all the various kingdoms, their politics, all the wars, the history such as it is. The planet’s history, which is minimal, and needs more detail.<br /><br />The story swings from POV to POV, changing drama  to a different perspective and potential disaster , that you’ve barely settled on one then you’ve sailed onto the next.<br /><br />If you’re looking for romance, there’s little of that here. At least for now.  But you can have fantastic characters with remarkable personalities, and deep emotional connections without a romantic factor.  None of that is really present here.  It’s more about all the things, the themes, plotting, world building, details. Something had to give.<br /><br />And at the end.  There’s a cliffhanger.<br /><br />I honestly didn’t care .  But for those that have a issue with cliffhangers, be warned.<br /><br />I’m trying to weigh if the great universe makes it worth proceeding for me.  I don’t think so because for me it’s about the characters and relationships, as well as giving them a great foundation.<br /><br />You need a heart to power the story, not just a reality fabulous structure.<br /><br />And I think Hailey Turner has lost the heart here no matter what that opening sentence says.",3.0,0,2022

A TRUE (Mystery) Thrill Ride! FUN!!!…..,"Not my usual genre. But I happened across an Audible sample  (which I also never use lol) — and I was immediately hooked!<br />I’m not going to offer a “jacket cover” description, nor book report, as some reviewers are apt to do (spoilers are no fun!).<br />I will share, however, that this author’s world building is superb. Rich in detail - most especially regarding scents and somatic perception (“you’re really there with the characters,” outside, feeling half blinded by the major thunderstorm in the middle of the night, sopping wet hair in your eyes, the rumble of thunder & bright flashes of lightening, feet and ankles freezing as you’re standing in rushing run-off water in the winter ….).<br />Add in the fact that the author’s a skilled wordsmith —  so abject panic and confusion is woven into, or is perhaps placed at the core, of the example scenario above. Thus, you are along for the ride, emotionally on this level - with the character(s) as well.<br />Character building - spot on. We know who these people are. Their histories and goals. What they are all about. Umm… errr…. Until we don’t.  …. ;)<br />Although — it did just occur to me. I have a pretty clear image, from the author’s writing, of what all the main players and most minor characters look like. But for some reason - the central character, Brooke, as well as her son - I really don’t have much of a picture in mind. Other than Brooke’s, “silky dark hair.”<br />So! Either this was a total oversight by ME while reading (95% probability lol), or these two were not crafted as strongly as the rest — image wise. If so, it could be because Brooke is the one “looking out” at everyone else. Though, that’s still no excuse.<br />Evvveerryyoonneeee talks about the amazing, “twists and turns,” in stories. Yet all too often, when you read the pedestaled books yourself, you find the promises to be more like one big “elbow” instead. Or “a” twist. Yk?<br />When reading The Inmate - about 65% of the way through, I had to go back and read through the beginning again, to help me see everything I THOUGHT I knew through a new lens.<br />After this point, the detective hat was placed firmly on, for the entirety of the pages!<br />Truly, this tale is FUN! I just finished it, and it is like a roller coaster ride.<br />One that is lengthy (but a quick read), has tight curvy switchback corners where you absolutely cannot see what’s coming next (and are gobsmacked a few times at what you discover!), loops which swing you in every direction, including upside down (definitely causing nausea, for differing reasons), and for sure — it’s a ride, that when you come screaming to a stop…..<br />You’ll sit wide-eyed. Shake you head. And think — “what the heck was THAT!?!” In the best way possible! Lol!<br />And like me, you’ll probably refer the title to someone else immediately after swiping that last page. It is truly that well written, easy and quick to read, and quite the thrill!",5.0,1,2022

Ambition and Greed Rule the Day,"If there is anyone who occasionally wonders why the bureaucracy in DC is sometimes referred to as The Swamp, this book will be quite enlightening. The titular character is Jody Asher, who at the book's beginning is the wife of Congressman Martin Asher, a 16-term member of the House of Representatives.  Author Kaira Rouda drops hints from the beginning that Mr. Asher has had trouble providing for Jody in the manner she wishes to be supported. Money-making opportunities abound for those who are willing to trade their influence and votes. Jody Asher loves all the entrapments of being a congressman's wife, except maybe those irresistible interns. Jody is preoccupied with putting on the most perfect wedding for her daughter, just when a news reporter is threatening to expose some of Martin's transgressions.  What makes matters worse is that the father of the Ashers' soon to be son-in-law is backing a candidate to run against Martin. But when Jody takes the spotlight, the true motives of characters in the novel are revealed. Although I found the book fascinating, I had difficulty finding any character that I liked.

excellent book!,"This book is absolutely excellent.  There are workouts for varying levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced, all clearly illustrated and explained. The author has also provided free videos on the web to show how to do them as an extra bonus.  Exercises are explained extremely well and have great graphics to illustrate.  The exercises cover all aspects of the core: abs, back, hips, torso, shoulders.  Yes, shoulders need to be included!  The workouts include torso, back, knees, hips, posture and balance.  Flexibility is also well covered.  The section on how to do core bracing correctly is the best I have ever seen.  If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would.  It is that good.  I am a certified personal trainer, have read a zillion books and articles on fitness and recovery issues, and would recommend this book to anyone.  If you ever have back or knee pain, which I sometimes do in the course of a typical life, this is a lifesaver.  This book helped me feel better in both areas in only a few days of following the back and knee workouts.  Highly recommend.",5.0,1,2022
An American Mirror... Look at it.,"I learned of Malcolm Nance some years back and was skeptical because I viewed him as a mainstream media guest propagandist.  While I believe that element still exists in him, there's no denying that he's well read, well educated, highly intelligent, well versed in American and World History, and is a real American patriot.  His expert analysis over the years is also prescient.  While reading his book, some facts I already knew from the January 6th hearings and some I learned from Mr. Nance (keep in mind that he wrote much of the book before the Jan 6th hearings).  This book is an important read.  Mr. Nance's disclosures, analysis, and predictions are scary and may come to pass if most Americans (the 60% of us who don't vote Republican) do not vote in upcoming elections for the next several years.  I find it odd that he appears to be the only non-mainstream media personality sounding the alarm on what the face/future of America will look like.  Very odd.  ""They Want to Kill Americans,"" along with Mr. Nance's recent book tour interviews, are highly insightful and worth your time.",5.0,1,2022
A worthy pick for an Amazon first read,For me this book has a somewhat unusual writing style that has the ability to draw you in. There is depth to the characters and scenes that really helps captivate. The downside of the writing style is that it can be confusing and hard to follow. It got me hooked from page 1. It’s a worthy pick from the Amazon first reads program.,4.0,1,2022
Lackluster Writing; Universally Unappealing Characters,"The writing in RICH BLOOD (Jason Rich Book 1) is plain and workmanlike–totally lacking in style.  Read it for the story about an alcoholic lawyer who is representing a guilty client in a high-profile murder trial. The client is the lawyer’s sister; the trial is the personal injury attorney’s very first jury trial.<br /><br />The characters are thinly drawn cardboard cutouts, and universally unappealing.  The victim, a wealthy GI doctor, is an unfaithful, workaholic husband.  The sister, the doctor’s wife, is a promiscuous, high-maintenance, manipulative, totally self-absorbed drug addict.  The killer, a petty criminal turned killer-for-hire, is a pathetic loser.<br /><br />The lawyer is your standard unhappy, divorced attorney; he is in big trouble with the state bar for substance abuse and for his marginally ethical, ambulance-chasing billboard advertising.  Thrown in for good measure is an amoral drug lord, the sister’s former lover, who both threatens the lawyer’s life unless the sister’s $50,000 debt is repaid and imposes trial strategy demands that may cost the attorney his trial win.",2.0,0,2022
meh,"I found myself getting angry at author the way this was written. Sam is 10, she has him acting like a teenager. 10 is 5th grade, it’s not the 15 year old personality she created. Also, main character is an elementary teacher. 1. She acts as if she’s no idea how kids act because she’s not a Mom and 2. Teachers are taught in college, and during In-Service Trainings, to recognize common behavioral patterns. Lastly, none of the characters are likable or even given real depth. The only person she truly painted was Lorna, and she’s a secondary character. I’d give this book a hard pass.",2.0,0,2022
(ATTN PUBLISHER) US Kindle version has major formatting issue,"Loved the book.  On my Kindle (latest Paperwhite with up to date system software) all instances of quoted dialogue following a previous paragraph of quoted dialogue are rendered incorrectly, like this:<br /><br />""Oh noes.""<br />I am quoted dialogue.""<br /><br />The first double quote in the second sentence is missing. This occurs throughout the book.  It affected my enjoyment.<br /><br />Interestingly, when I highlight the passage to submit as a typo on Kindle, the Kindle thinks the double quote is present--it reflects back ""I am quoted dialogue"" in its status message to the user.

A broken promise,"So in the third book description the author says that he is not going to make this an add every pretty girl to the harem type of series and that future books past that one will focus more on the plot and less of the women. Well that doesn't happen, this book has very little plot development and instead is all about Alex's romantic life and women trying to get with him. Half the book seems to have been spent talking about a pair of gold digging twins trying to get with him in the real world. The rest of the book is divided into political relationships with very little fighting or crafting.<br /><br />Deeper spoilers. So Alex's relationship with his current real world girlfriends is suppose to be about trust and openness because that's the only way its suppose to work out. They all agreed to this yet the girlfriends constantly go behind his back to make deals to bring other women in and screw up his plans. Another bit of dishonesty is with the parents, they go out of their way to assure them that they are practicing safe sex but low and behold all of a sudden both girls think they are pregnant, and Alex has to ask if they are even on birth control.",1.0,0,2022
A delightful book that will have you happily cooking delicious food,"This cookbook is surprisingly good, and I’m enjoying working my way through it. The recipes I’ve tried so far (shrimp and grits, ribeye steak, and maple spam) have been big on flavor and low in effort. Seriously I was surprised by the serious flavor hit you get with the shrimp and grits. My wife who normally won’t even taste grits loved that one. The author has a very relaxed zen vibe that makes this book a pleasant read. He seems to make a point to exclude needless complexity and make things easy for the cook. And while it’s a cookbook it’s also a little bit of a story about how he spent his pandemic lockdown developing this cookbook with his mother Jean, and the experience of learning from and bonding with her. There is a larger theme of what it means to be Korean American and it has implications for conversations people have these days about “authenticity” in food and questions what it even means. I’ve only gotten to the part where I am going to make Kimchi but since that is going to take a month or so it’s time to post the review. I give it an enthusiastic 5 stars. The only minor quibble I have is I don’t like the formatting that much. Occasionally a quote will be blown up into a text box and then I end up reading that quote twice, and sometimes it’s not really a profound enough statement worth reading twice. Trivial issue.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />There is a pantry section where ingredients are described, and Korean as well as English spellings are provided in case the Asian grocery has items with no English translation (nice). Some name brands mentioned but I’d prefer a few more name brands be mentioned to help those of us with zero experience.<br /><br />Units mostly imperial but metric weights provided where needed, like for baking.<br /><br />Every recipe has a picture<br /><br />Links appear to work appropriately on kindle, but may require an extra page flip to get to the exact section on occasion<br /><br />I’ve only noticed one error so far and it’s an extraneous sentence fragment that can’t be highlighted which may just be an error specific to my download.

"Destiny shapes our ends, but making ends meet is our own responsibility. ~ Arnold H. Glasow","“The Marriage Bargain” is a poor Mr. Darcy story.<br /><br />Quote from the book: Shall I blame Great-grandfather for marrying a bride twenty years his junior and building a new house he could ill-afford only to keep her happy? Grandfather always said it ought not to have been done, that it had been too expensive, and far more than the estate could bear.<br /><br />Darcy has been away from England for five years, working as an agent of the government.  His father, George Darcy, was too proud to allow his son a career in England.  Now, after his father’s death, Darcy has come home to Pemberley in financial ruin.  For three generations, the Darcys have outspent their income, the last spendthrift having been his mother “burying her discontent by spending money we did not have.”<br /><br />The real measure of your wealth is how much you'd be worth if you lost all your money. ~ Author unknown<br /><br />I was prepared for a story of Darcy diligently working his way through cash-flow issues.  I was not prepared for this:<br /><br />Quote from the book: When he saw her last, two and a half years before, Darcy had developed a tendre for her. At seventeen and just entering society, Caroline Bingley had been everything a young lady should be, and more. She was extraordinarily beautiful and gentle and kind. Had he the means to properly support a wife, he might have proposed to her, even knowing his father would never approve or accept her as his daughter-in-law.<br /><br />What?  WHAT???<br /><br />The Bingleys, as usual, are tradespeople.  However, Mr. Bingley, Sr., still lives and has fulfilled his dream of estate-ownership.<br /><br />Quote from the book: Northlands was not a large estate; it brought in a little over two thousand pounds a year. What I would not give to have even that much, Darcy thought grimly, or to be free of debt, as Bingley is.<br /><br />Darcy visits his godfather, Lord Halsey, to consider his options.<br /><br />Quote from the book: “The way I see it,” the earl said, “you have two choices. You can sell Pemberley for whatever you can get for it and settle as many debts as possible. Or you could marry a wealthy woman and use her fortune to restore the estate.”<br /><br />Lord Halsey knows of a wealthy young woman who wants marriage and children; who prefers country life to a life in London; who wants to improve her social situation.  He arranges a meeting with Edward Gardiner, an extremely successful businessman who is the sole guardian of his niece, Elizabeth Bennet.  Elizabeth’s mother died young, leaving Mr. Bennet with two young daughters.  When Elizabeth was still a little girl, her father and Jane were killed in a carriage crash.  Uncle Gardiner, a widower with no children, has raised Elizabeth.<br /><br />To recap: Darcy is poor; the Bingleys are in a similar situation to the Bennets in canon; Elizabeth is very rich.<br /><br />A full purse makes disagreeable men, and even knaves, tolerable in society. ~ James Lendall Basford<br /><br />During Darcy’s time out of the country, Georgiana has resided with the Fitzwilliams, known as Lord and Lady Servington in this story.  The Servingtons treat Georgiana as their poor relation, constantly belittling her.  She has few clothes or other possessions.  Her accomplishments are mocked.  The only family members who value her are her cousins, the Colonel and the Viscount, and his new wife.<br /><br />Darcy dislikes his visits to the Servingtons but he is also considered a poor relation and feels he must appease the family as much as possible.  He wants to get Georgiana away from them and she certainly would like to leave.  His marriage would accomplish that.<br /><br />The trouble with spending all your time acquiring wealth is that you never get wealthy enough to buy back your time. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />As a married couple, the Darcys do well enough together at Pemberley, but difficulties arise when they return to London.  Uncle Gardiner is generous, especially to Georgiana.  Darcy’s pride rears its ugly head when he begins to resent Gardiner’s wealth.<br /><br />Elizabeth has unresolved issues from the accident that claimed her father and sister.  She is outgoing but holds herself separate, letting no one see her inner pain.<br /><br />We know how much damage Caroline Bingley can do when she has no real power.  What will result when Darcy is easily influenced by the shrew?  What will it take for Darcy to see the truth?<br /><br />When you have read as much JAFF as I have, you value stories that are unique.  This one hits the spot!<br /><br />The little money I have — that is my wealth, but the things I have for which I would not take money, that is my treasure. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",5.0,1,2022
Please Start Trusting Ypour Readers Again - Enough With the Info Dumps!,"Oh Douglas, Douglas. We've had this conversation before. Info dumps are BAD writing technique. You've been on a somewhat steady stream of inflicting more and more info dumps on your readers, and reading Portals tells me you're just gonna keep heading down that path, if it sells books. It's a shame, really, because Portals has absolutely fascinating premises. In that area, it's five stars. But even the action scenes are rife with info dumping. Create a world and let the reader figure it out from the clues, don't just flat out explain why everything is the way it is. It's as if the info dumps exist to explain the twists and turns of the plot (which are, as always, good twists and turns.) But you don't need to feel the constant necessity to explain the twists and turns. Trust the reader to accept them, because you've earned that trust. Sure, I, as a reader, if I encounter a twist or turn that feels odd or illogical, will wonder why the author went that way. But I'd rather have the wondering answered not by just telling me but slowly and surely painting a picture that enables me as the reader to suss it out for myself. Challenge me. Info dumps take that challenge away from the reader. Show more respect for the intellectual capacity of your readers! Paint subtly and cleverly and the serious reader will thank you for not giving everything away. I understand the desire to explain, to do info dumps. I, myself, and quite guilty of being overly verbacious and  not succinct, when writing emails, letters, documents, etc., and writing in a manner to make sure I've covered every little point in every possible way so there's no chance of a misunderstaning. I know where the impulse comes from. Pedagogues tend to think like that. Fiction authors shouldn't have to do that. Your stories will provide plenty of pedagogy (especially in the afterwards) just as they are, without having to ""'splain it to me, Lucy."" Give it a shot. You used to trust your readers at least a bit more.",3.0,0,2022
Real bad things for picking this book,"Its day 5.  At 65% normally I would have finished this book on day one...but that would mean the book was well written and interesting. This is not.  Its a hot mess I'll say that...the protagonist is pathetic and likely Lesbian to make imclusivity points....she doesn't come across well...I'm glad they didn't chose ""flaming gay"" stereotypes but... Yesh.  And before someone yells I'm anti lgbtq+ I'm not, there are many books with those characters and I find them great. This...sucks.  Zero use of police procedure reality even if out of touch with reality...it barely pulls ofF red neck or trailer trash very well so I get the struggle with getting the LGBTQ+  characters right.  So far...none are likeable and at 30% I thought it a shame they all didn't end up at the bottom of the dam, dead.  Maybe the authors other book is better...but recheck murder mystery thrillers with LGBTQ+  ain't her forte.  Glad it was free on kindle first reads or I'd demand money back.",1.0,0,2022

"From Startling Beginning to Shocking Conclusion, there are Some Really Bad Things","The action in ""Real Bad Things,"" by Kelly J. Ford, starts when the body of a man missing for twenty-five years is found in the lock of a dam.  Immediately, three girls and one boy now in their 40s become nervous that their role in the man's demise and coverup may be revealed.  Teenagers do stupid things that can come back to haunt them.  Any adult reading the story will see how it could have been handled at the time to result in an almost happy ending for all four teens. Instead, the least culpable girl, Jane, had confessed all those years ago, but after serving a brief stint in juvenile detention was released for lack of evidence (no body) and left town to separate from her monster of a mother, Diane, friend Angie, brother Jason, and love interest Georgia Lee. The discovery of the body brings Jane back to town and casts her into the orbit of her family and former friends.  What I liked most about this book were the beginning and the end.  The shocking jumpstart of the book had me hoping to race to the revelation of the true facts.  Who really killed Warren (Jane's abusive stepfather)?  The ending was equally satisfying, as even though I was expecting a twist, what transpired was not even close to what I had imagined. I got a little tired of the F bombs, but the people in the fictional town of Maud most likely really would talk that way.  I was exasperated that the former teens now as adults reverted to their childlish thinking and ways.  Teenage angst dominated the pages as the characters repeatedly, almost ad nauseum, had thoughts such as, ""Is she mad at me?""; ""Why doesn't she text me back?""; ""Does she think I did it?""; ""Does she love me?""; etc.  But with these particular characters, the traumatic discovery of the body had the potential to land each and every one of them in serious trouble, so the fact that it might resurrect their immaturity is not unbelievable. Reading about the different paths the characters had taken in life, the startling beginning, and the explosive ending made this book a 4 for me despite my few criticisms.",4.0,1,2022
Parton + Patterson = Country Music + Mystery!,"What a thrilling equation it is when Dolly Parton collaborates with James Patterson to create a county music mystery!  AnnieLee Keyes is the protagonist with the dream of making it big as a country singer in Nashville.  Such dreams are a dime a dozen, but success is one in a million.  It's clear that the young, penniless, and homeless AnnieLee has endured a life of hard knocks, but exactly what that might be is not revealed until nearly the end of the book.  Readers can enjoy guessing before the big reveal.<br /><br />AnnieLee's pursuit of her dream begins with begging for chances to perform for free, or perhaps for a meal, at small time bars and dives in Nashville.  AnnieLee's voice is magnificent enough to attract the attention of an associate of the revered and retired county music star Ruthanna Ryder.  Ruthanna is grieving a particularly hard loss, and when she meets AnnieLee she feels a connection with the young singer.  After telling AnnieLee that life as a star can be  grueling and advising her to give up and go home, Ruthanna eventually takes AnnieLee under her wing and coaches her on everything in the county music world from agents, record labels, and recording sessions. to fashion and makeup. Along the way, AnnieLee grows closer to Ethan Blake, who is the young man who recognized her talent and alerted Ruthanna Ryder. Ethan is also suffering from ordeals in his past. A treat for readers of the book is the inclusion of the lyrics to AnnieLee's songs.  She has a gift for being able to turn the events of any moment into a heartfelt melody.<br /><br />The first part of the book is mostly the country music component, but a sudden development results in AnnieLee's disappearance.  From there, it is mostly classic Patterson at his best. The satisfying conclusion is exactly what you would expect from the unique blend of Parton + Patterson. Don't miss this musical mystery!",5.0,1,2022

Strong but balanced view of the value of truth and dispassionate rational analysis Review,"The 2022 book entitled ""Starry Messenger: Cosmic Perspectives on Civilization” by Neil deGrasse Tyson shared both the value of the truth and occasionally provided appropriate candid examples of where facts and truth should be tempered by a more emotional response.<br /> Illustrative of the style and substance of this book, Tyson writes: “We sow hatred of others fueled by what we think is true, or what we want to be true, without regard to what is true… We’ve lost all sight of what distinguishes facts from opinions. We’re quick with acts of aggression and slow with acts of kindness… When Galileo Galilei published Sidereus Nuncius in 1610, he brought to Earth cosmic truths that had been waiting since antiquity to descend upon human thought. Galileo’s freshly perfected telescope revealed a universe unlike anything people presumed to be true… Two fast takeaways from his book: (1) human eyes alone are insufficient to reveal fundamental truths about the operations of nature, (2) Earth is not the center of all motion. It orbits the Sun as just one among the other known planets… Sidereus Nuncius translates from the Latin to Starry Messenger… Think of Starry Messenger as a trove of insights, informed by the universe and brought to you by the methods and tools of science.”<br /> Tyson writes: “When people disagree in our complex world of politics, religion, and culture, the causes are simple, even if the resolutions are not. We all wield different portfolios of knowledge. We possess different values, different priorities, and different understandings of all that unfolds around us. We see the world differently from one another, and by doing so, we construct tribes based on who looks like us, who prays to the same gods as we do, and who shares our moral code… All I can promise is that whatever opinions you currently hold, an infusion of science and rational thinking can render them deeper and more informed than ever before. This path can also expose any unfounded perspectives or unjustified emotions you may carry… scientists are not in search of each other’s opinions. We’re in search of each… other’s data. Even when arguing opinions, you may be surprised how potent a rational perspective can be.<br />Science especially enhances our health, wealth, and security, which are greater today for more people on Earth than at any other time in human history… The scientific method… can be summarized in one sentence, which is all about objectivity:<br />Do whatever it takes to avoid fooling yourself into believing that something is true when it is false, or that something is false when it is true.”<br /> Tyson writes: “In 1660… the Royal Society of London was founded… inspired by its marvelously blunt motto, “Take nobody’s word for it.”… in 1863, a year when he clearly had more pressing matters at hand, Abraham Lincoln—the first Republican US president—signed into existence the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)… After thinking deeply about how a scientist views the world, about what Earth looks like from space, and about the magnitude of cosmic age and of infinite space, all terrestrial thoughts change. Your brain recalibrates life’s priorities and reassesses the actions one might take in response. No outlook on culture, society, or civilization remains untouched. In that state of mind, the world looks different. You are transported. You experience life through the lens of a cosmic perspective.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Endowed by methods and tools of inquiry refined over the centuries, scientists may be the exclusive discoverers of what is objectively true in the universe… Objective truths don’t come from any seated authority, nor from any single research paper… Objective truths, established by repeated experiments that give consistent results, are not later found to be false. No need to revisit the question of whether Earth is round; whether the Sun is hot; whether humans and chimps share more than 98 percent identical DNA; or whether the air we breathe is 78 percent nitrogen… Objective truths of science are not founded in belief systems. They are not established by the authority of leaders or the power of persuasion. Nor are they learned from repetition or gleaned from magical thinking. To deny objective truths is to be scientifically illiterate, not to be ideologically principled.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Personal truths are what you may hold dear but have no real way of convincing others who disagree, except by heated argument, coercion, or force… Social, political, or legislative attempts to require that everybody agree with your personal truths are ultimately dictatorships… close cousins of personal truths, are political truths.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Yet Earth is also a giant killing machine. More than 99 percent of all species that ever lived are now extinct from forces such as regional and global climate change as well as environmental assaults such as volcanoes, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, disease, and infestations…. Smallpox, malaria, and the bubonic plague together have killed upwards of 1.5 billion people throughout time, worldwide. That toll far exceeds all deaths from all armed conflicts in the history of our species. Nature has killed more of us than we have of ourselves. These thoughts hardly ever (likely never) arise whenever we declare nature’s beauty… After reading Joyce Kilmer’s most famous poem, will you ever again walk past a tree without reflecting on its silent majesty? I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast; A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray; A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain. Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.”<br /> Tyson writes: “we’re all wired with linear minds, leaving us prone to think small. It’s not our fault. We think in additives and multiples, with no evolutionary pressure to think in exponentials. An exponential is a number raised to the power of another number. When you do that, quantities and rates described by them rise (or shrink) faster than our normal capacity to comprehend. Consider this simple example: You can choose to receive $ 5 million now or instead receive a penny a day doubled for a month. Most people would take the $ 5 million and… run, avoiding the pennies altogether. Let’s first think it through. That’s a penny today. Then two pennies tomorrow. Four pennies the next day. Eight pennies the day after that, and so on. How rich are you at the end? If you do the math, on the thirty-first day you will be handed $ 10,737,418.24. And the sum of pennies from your previous thirty days brings your total to $ 21,474,836.47. That’s the power of an exponential.”<br /> Tyson writes: “We think of Darwinian evolution as imperceptibly slow. That’s because we live, at most, 100 years, and our brain wiring resists the fact that speciation can take thousands and even millions of times longer than our lifetime to unfold.<br />How about my favorite? If the gridiron of a football field were a timeline of the universe, with the Big Bang at one end and this moment at the other, then all of human recorded history would span the thickness of a blade of grass in the end zone.”<br /> Tyson writes: “With systems in place to disseminate thought, such as scientific conferences, peer-reviewed journals, and patent filings, every next generation can use discoveries of the previous generation as fresh starting points. No reinventing the wheel. No wasted efforts. This blunt and obvious fact carries profound consequences. It means knowledge grows exponentially, not linearly, rendering our brains hopeless in our attempts to predict the future based on the past… a fifteen-year doubling time is consistent with the pace of other active fields of scientific research.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Daily life in 1930 would be unrecognizable to anyone transported from the year 1900… In 1958, the world’s first commercial jet airplane—the Boeing 707, flown by Pan American Airways—enjoys a wingspan wider than the distance flown by the Wright brothers’ first flight in 1903… Daily life in 1960 would be unrecognizable to anyone transported from the year 1930… The laser goes from a specialized piece of laboratory equipment costing tens of thousands of dollars to a $ 5.99 laser pointer impulse buy at the checkout line of Walmart… Computers go from being expensive, room-size, special-purpose machines used exclusively by the military and by scientists to desktop necessities. The personal computer, introduced in the 1980s by IBM and Apple Computer, permanently transforms the daily habits of how people work and play.<br />Between 1960 and 1990, we build the most powerful rocket ever to launch, and with it journey nine times to the Moon. While there we orbit, land, walk, skip, golf, and drive three electric buggies across its barren dusty terrain. We also develop a reusable space shuttle and allocate funds to build an international orbiting space station the size of a football field… From 1990 to 2020, we map the human genome. Computers become portable—small enough to carry in a backpack… Smartphones further host countless utilities that enhance everyday life, including a camera that shoots high-quality photos and video. Oh, and it also makes phone calls. The smartphone may be the single greatest invention in the history of inventions. In 2020 there are three billion of them in a world of eight billion people. Before 2007 there were zero.”<br /> Tyson writes: “The art of asking questions represents an important dimension of science literacy.”<br /> Tyson writes: ""Part the curtains of all-out conflict and find the puppeteers of politics and religion. Two topics that, we are warned, should never be discussed in polite company. Two topics with a lot in common for how deeply personal they can be. Two topics that, when disagreements are severe, can lead to bloodshed and full-blown war… Including all casualties among all warring nations across the six-year span of World War II (1939 through 1945), more than one thousand people were killed—per hour. A morbid and inevitable consequence of forcing your personal truths upon others in a world that is fundamentally pluralistic. A scientist’s entire mission in life is to discover features of nature that are true, even if they conflict with your philosophies.”<br /> Tyson writes: “That’s an implicit contract we carry into all arguments on the frontier of discovery. Who decides the outcome? Nobody does. Arguing more loudly or strenuously or more articulately than your opponent simply reveals how annoying and obstinate you are. The resolution almost always comes when more or better data arrive.<br />like the proverbial blind men who each describe their encounter with an elephant—the tusk, the tail, the ears, the legs, the trunk. They could argue all day about who is right and who is wrong. Or they could keep exploring, and eventually figure out that these are distinct parts of a single animal. That too requires more experiments and observations—more data—to determine what is objectively true… Apart from conflicts over politics or over what God or gods you may worship, humans persistently wage war over access to limited resources, such as energy (oil and gas), clean water, mineral deposits, and precious metals… the mathematical value of pi does not change as you cross passport control at a nation’s border. The laws of biology, chemistry, and physics remain the same too.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Those farthest left were blinded by their own bias, tainting their capacity to see the world rationally. The politics of Fox News commentators incenses them. It incenses me as well. But in their far-left worldview, everything Fox was synonymous with Fox News. They never noticed that entire swaths of Fox’s portfolio are paragons of progressive programming… Hidden bias can cause a persistent urge to see all that agrees with you and ignore all that does not, even when countervailing examples abound. Among the many categories of how to fool… oneself, the most pernicious is confirmation bias: you remember the hits and forget the misses. It affects us all, at one level or another. The antidote? Dispassionate rational analysis.”<br /> Tyson writes: “The nineteenth-century German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss is considered by some (myself included) to be the greatest mathematician since antiquity… By 1809 Gauss had fully derived the famous “bell curve,” perhaps the most powerful and profound statistical tool in all of science. Also known as the “normal distribution,” it reveals that for practically everything you might measure in the world, most values you report will fall in the middle of a range.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Every substance you could possibly ingest, food and otherwise, has a calculated lethal… dose associated with it, measured by what’s called LD50. That’s the dose per kilogram of body weight where 50 percent of the people who consume that amount will die quickly… There’s another metric, called no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), which addresses the long-term influence of a substance on your health and is more sensible when thinking about food safety… You would need to consume four hundred million pints of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream for its trace amounts of glyphosate to kill you. But after only 20 pints you will die from its sugar content… Ben & Jerry’s made the right corporate decision if it protected their profits. Although they could have also used the occasion as a teaching moment—a mind-blowing lesson on comparative risk.”<br /> Tyson writes: “A study from 2016, authored by nine wildlife scientists, modeled the predator-prey relation between cougars and white-tailed deer. They reported that within thirty years, a vibrant predator population dining upon unwanted deer can avoid 21,400 injuries, prevent 155 human deaths, and save $ 2.1 billion, all from car accidents that won’t happen. Naturally, cougars also occasionally eat people, especially small wayward children—the model predicts about thirty of them. So we have two choices: 1) Introduce hungry cats that eat thirty people in thirty years, or 2) don’t introduce hungry cats, and leave car-deer accidents unabated that injure thousands, kill hundreds, and cost billions.”<br /> Tyson writes: “During the ten-year span from 2010 to 2019 (excluding charter, cargo, and private flights), eight billion passengers flew on commercial airplanes without a single crash, 32 although two died from other causes… Something Joni Mitchell knew well in 1967: I’ve looked at life from both sides now From win and lose and still somehow It’s life’s illusions I recall I really don’t know life at all.”<br /> Tyson writes: “Most people of the Earth, like grizzly bears, eat whatever is served for dinner… Apart from these issues, the production of meat in the US is staggeringly efficient. Across all fifty states, for example, we consume nine billion chickens per year—a rate that’s 3 times higher than the world average… chicken constitutes some of the most inexpensive protein you can consume in the marketplace… Entire branches of the animal kingdom are pure carnivores: lions don’t long for kale salads while mauling zebras; snakes don’t forage for berries; owls don’t ogle the broccoli in your garden… blunt truth of human existence: our three sources of energy—protein, carbohydrates, and fat—all come from killing and eating other forms of life in our ecosystem. We can get some of our necessary minerals, like salt, from the environment, but you can’t live on minerals. Two foods rise above the “I must kill to survive” way of life: milk and honey. Combined, the two are rich in protein, carbohydrates, and fat and don’t require the death of any living thing for your nourishment.”<br /> Tyson writes: “An analysis of colors offers insight. For simplicity and convenience, we speak of the seven colors of the rainbow—the seven colors of the visible solar spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. You can remember the sequence because their initial letters make the acronym for somebody named “Roy G. Biv.”… What hardly anybody talks about, but which astrophysicists know deeply, is that the colors from red through violet fall on a continuum. If we possessed the visual acuity and attendant vocabulary to describe them, we could identify thousands of colors and their hues, blending seamlessly. No sharp boundaries to be found anywhere… [On] COLOR & RACE… people are more the same than different… Back on Earth, many places will label your skin color black or white or brown. That’s it… The world’s staggering range of human skin color has been reduced to three shades, and somehow everybody’s okay with that. Maybe you added red and yellow, to include Native Americans and Asians, even though nobody’s skin is any of these colors. White people don’t disappear when they walk in front of snowbanks. And while skin color can get very dark, nobody is pure black.”<br /> Tyson writes: “A study of deeply indigenous populations of the world, communities that have lived in their locations for thousands of years, reveals a strong correspondence between latitude on Earth and how dark your skin happens to be. The closer to the equator, where sunlight is most intense, the darker your skin. The farther from… the equator, as you near the poles, the lighter your skin… We know that the molecular pigment melanin—the active ingredient of dark skin—can dissipate 99.9 percent of UV light. We also know that UV can destroy skin cells in ways that lead to sunburn and eventually cancer.”<br /> Tyson writes: “my wife, who has a PhD in mathematical physics, was quick to note that many cosmologists clutched to… the idea that we may live in a steady-state universe, long after data from leading telescopes made it clear we do not. At the time, we learned that our expanding universe, birthed from a Big Bang, may one day recollapse and perhaps cycle endlessly. She wondered whether the steady-state cosmologists, most of whom have never menstruated, had a hard time thinking about and embracing cycles—something half the world’s population lives with for most of their adult lives.”<br /> Tyson writes: “When putting forth a scientific hypothesis, you should be your own greatest critic. You don’t want colleagues finding holes in your reasoning before you do. It looks bad and it reveals you didn’t do your homework… I presume the preternaturally progressive Unitarian minister Theodore Parker would too, as he wrote in 1853: I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. And from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.”<br /> Tyson writes: “If Aristotle’s edict matters: “Law is reason free from passion,” and if the allegorical Lady Justice, blindfolded, wielding a sword in one hand and balance scales in the other, truly symbolized how it works, then your jury every time would contain data and information experts who, in search of the truth,… already noted, hypothesis testing as practiced today did not become a routine thing in science until the 1600s. Before then, natural philosophers—what today we call scientists—were perfectly content declaring things that seemed true, ignorant of a later time when experiments and observations would supplant suppositions. Not humans, but nature—the universe itself—would become the ultimate judge, jury, and executioner in science.”",5.0,1,2022
"It's frustrating, but satisfying (and that's the point!)","V.R. Christensen does it again! Her protagonist, Caro, shares her story from first-person POV, so we truly get to see how she grows from a resentful young woman with strange ideas about herself and the true love her of her life, to a confident young woman who only fears she is too late to confront those fears held onto for so long. It's a frustrating story in that Caro has what she wants, but she has talked herself out of it, and it's satisfying to see her become honest with herself and as she does, we have our resolution.<br /><br />It's clean, and interesting, and I think relatable, in that if you've ever been a 20-something with literally no idea how to live your life, and slowly figuring it out. (I mean, we've all been there, right?)",5.0,1,2022

Absolutely 4.5 Stars!,"NOTE: I received early access from NetGalley, for this manuscript, in exchange for writing an impartial review. Completed on February 24TH , 2022.<br />I was extremely thrilled to learn I had been given the opportunity to complete an early reading of this, as I've read all the previous ones so far.<br /><br />I'm not going to plague you with the storyline and details by recapping information you can already obtain, provided by the jacket cover, publisher, author, and other reviewers.<br /><br />This one, as with all the previous ones in the series, reads exceedingly strong as a stood-alone or as part of a series, and presents enough back history, where you can get a general feel for the previous plots. Morgan accomplishes this without making you feel as if you're lost, overwhelmed/inundated, or having to drudge through previously read material. This is a rare accomplishment in today's writing world. (IMHO, It distinguishes the true professional authors, from the onslaught of an overly populated ""field."")<br /><br />Whether you're aware of the history or not, you immediately identify, and establish compassion, for Ursule the young main character, and her Maman, Agnes.<br /><br />The family secrets are concealed, even amongst one another in a disfunctional sort of way, but you still feel the strong<br />mother/ daughter connection, and support, an almost ""us against the world"" vibe. Even amongst the clan, the secrets, the stories, the history, blur and blend to grow into legendary measures, depending on who's point of view is being expressed.<br /><br />Morgan graphically immerses the reader into the late 1700's into the 1800's time period, to not only be a female, but an outcast group from society. The apropo significance which covers the not so fictional parts, and shrouds the brutal reality of what it was genuinely like to be a sector of the undesirables. Women were deemed in the negative populace of a subpar inferior classification, on top of being coupled with the difficult and laborious grimness and endurance of the ""gypsy,"" Romanian sector.<br /><br />The hardships, the losses, all tug at your heart strings, yet you're remarkably cognizant of the beauty in living during ""simpler"" times. To feel enraptured by the sound of a running brook, the smell of herbs drying, the rustling sound of the leaves of the trees as they gently blow across the lands, the strong desires to always be roaming, allows you to discern the tranquil and tempestuous atmospheres, as if you're preceptionally synchronized with the two women.<br /><br />As each section progresses, and we move deeper into the future, the pleasure, and the anguish, appear as a continued theme. For who can experience full joy, without the knowledge of true sorrow?<br /><br />Without providing any spoilers, the love she craves, despite her cynism, and to be passionately embraced by it, as well as the desirable daughter she covets and yearns for, in order to pass the Ochière Family's legacy and history down to, only to possibly be met with disappointment again?? Ach! It almost becomes too much to bare at times. Lol<br /><br />So much rich depth provided to wonder, just exactly what will happen to and with the proud legacy they've so embraced, and kept alive through multiple generations, if this essential element does not come to fruition. I must admit, I was held in great suspense as the book wrapped up the final section. I was actually dreading which direction the book could end. I am happy to say it was all the way through the last few pages, that held my attention and my curiosity was filled.<br /><br />It's somewhat obvious that through the mentioning of a particular child, Morgan has given herself a setup for the story to continue, if she so chooses.<br /><br />I have enjoyed this particular book the most out of this entire series!",4.0,1,2022
"not your grandmas romance story, slow burn spice, FUN FUN FUN characters","The Levelling Up series was not something I expected to like. I had learned of this book on a random FB sponsored ad. I dont recall what drew me to it, but let me tell you none of this is my typical genre to read from. I think it was the appeal of reading of a character in her 40s. I'm in my 40s. Nice to see the main star to be someone outside the typical 20 something. Figured I'd give it a go, and if I didnt like it I have the option to stop, yes?<br /><br />The first chapter was meh. Though, I tend to be a little snarfy when I first begin a new book. Takes a little to get into it. But then once it started rolling, I was so very much hooked. I think once I realized that the writer can write, can flesh out detail, can give life to not only main characters, but give a lot to side characters, and I can imagine the surroundings so well yet am not spoon fed all everything. I was impressed, and hoked. I cant get enough, I could read from this world forever more. Love the characters, all the fun quirky details, and the lovely boost to my imagination.<br /><br />If you aren't reading KF Breene, you should. Very funny, lots of wonderful side characters, and the main story has some meat. But I could read all about the Levelling Up world without any story line. I just LOVE hanging out with all the characters. Funny stuff, hot stuff, some feels. Not overlly dramatic. And not at all scary despite some freaky stuff going on.<br /><br />And yes, there are ridiculously hot guys in this, with cringey names (I suspect it is an intentional nod toward the lame romantic tripe of so called romance books). Stop clutching your pearls long enough to just enjoy this. It's a slow burn, and please feel free to enjoy it. OR dont pick up a fantasy (on many levels) book.<br /><br />If the details in this book freak you out, then you wont be able to handle the intense spice of some of her other work. Ruin of Roses, comes to mind. That is another incredible story with loads of detail, awesome side characters, but the heat is turned way way way up. Wowza. Well done.. mm hhmmm",5.0,1,2022

"Every page, a delight","Hana Videen's 'Wordhord' got my attention immediately. She tells the long story of the linguistic patterns evolving from barely discernable Middle English (Chaucer) to undiscernible Old English (Beowulf). If you're like me wrestling with the mental pronunciation of these strange words, then Videen assuredly helps clear it up. It's a must-read for the deep diver of 'Dark Age' Britain and generally the lingua franca of North Sea peoples. It's a rich look into the 1500-1000-year-old words we use every day. It's Videen's use of phonetics from runes through the modern alphabet that I can roll around under my breath that brings to clarity the Old English linguistic anchor in current English.<br /><br />Language is a hallmark of our species — so much so that until the mid-16th century the capacity for language was the key difference between us and animals, between humans and the animals that God placed under Adam's authority.<br /><br />Language and the 'collection' of words, these words tell a story, delineated medieval social class. More valuable than gold which a low-brow thief might possess, a large collection of words, one's 'wordhord', ones vocabulary separated the high status and educated from the masses.<br /><br />Language has always created intellectual constructs in time. The word concept example of ""Nature"" is unknown, our modern understanding meaningless in OE & ME. Nature is not God created 'mann'. 'Not man' was scary theme, Beowulf's thinking but non-speaking Grendal, raw, unknown, and untouched by God's care keeper humans. The uncontested mission of 'Mann"" was to submit non-man to man control and God's good. When everyone, everywhere agrees in the truth of daemons and ghosts, what does every mind conjure in daily routine? Such was the universe of thought until the mid-16th century. It's 180° from the 19th-century origins of our 'nature' understanding.<br /><br />In this world lit by fire, candles represent another ubiquitous concept of light and darkness and similar to the Innuit language of many words to describe snow. 'Sea candles', a term that I've seen in ancient maritime contexts and experienced only poetically as 'candles' caught my attention. The bright reflections from the rising and setting sun and moonlight upon rippling water create a scene like thousands of candles on the water. The sun of course was logically the big candle and so known in the wordhord. Candlelight language is slipping from modern word imagery.<br /><br />First, the otherwise unintelligible spelling is unchanged or slightly changed as in an accent, in modern pronunciation. Smith is ""smith."" Corn is 'corn'. A child is ""child"" but, in symbolically ancient spellings and runes.<br /><br />Second, the phonetics of predecessor runes flow into understandable English words with many of the same relative meanings. The 'thorn', g, p , f - rune characters most especially.<br /><br />Third, Germanic and Scandinavian origins in Old English suggest a 'Mare North Sea' lingua franca that looks suspiciously akin to Romance languages formed around the Mediterranean in the same period.<br /><br />Fourth, the book is an immense help in sound picturing the strange spellings and characters in my mind when I read the period history.<br /><br />Fifth, as a student of Latin and Greek, I had a mental image that the two perhaps contributed more to English than Old English and Nordic/Germanic root. I was wrong. English is thoroughly rooted in Dark Age Old English.<br /><br />Videen's narrative technique, humor, and use of the word-hoard in context and at the chapter's end become a mini-Old English learning lesson.<br /><br />Fascinating, reasonably short read. Well worth it. I followed this read with CS Lewis's Oxford-don scholarship in ""The Discarded Image"" to comprehend more fully the extent and limits of the medieval mind. The pair make a rather complete set.",5.0,1,2022

I felt like the author really got some things right, like those blurry first few months of new motherhood, the combination of judging/fear-mongering/competition that takes place among new moms, and the feeling of parenting without your own parent around. Even though the plot was a little out there, she set it up in such a way that you could believe how characters in a sleep-deprived, traumatized state could end up in this bizarre situation.<br /><br />Just a note...the plot line does involve rape, and it does become central to the later parts of the story.",5.0,1,2022
It is a rare woman who can overcome her desire to remain pretty ...,"It is a rare woman who can overcome her desire to remain pretty and allow herself to become beautiful. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />As our story opens, Elizabeth has returned from Hunsford with her memories of a disastrous proposal.  The oldest Bennet sisters are residing in London.  Mrs. Gardiner is having a difficult early pregnancy and the sisters help with the household and the children.<br /><br />Mr. Gardiner is visited by Lord Henry Lyfford to negotiate a change in pricing for the wool Gardiner buys from the Lyfford estate.  Obvious differences are uncovered between what Gardiner’s records show he paid and what Lyfford’s records show he received.  Gardiner offers to call his niece who is very good with mathematics to review the differences in the corresponding records.<br /><br />At this point, I thought this was going to be another “super Lizzy” story with Elizabeth being outstanding in every possible area of life.  Instead, I read this paragraph:<br /><br />Mr. Gardiner rang for a servant to fetch his niece. A few minutes later the door to the study opened, and through it came the loveliest creature Lyfford had ever beheld. He might perhaps have seen a more beautiful face, or more golden hair, or eyes of a deeper blue, but never united and certainly never in company with such a sweet, serene expression.<br /><br />Jane Bennet meets Rainman!<br /><br />The story manages not to turn into a “super Jane” story either.  Portraits of both sisters are somewhat advanced from canon but not unbelievably so.  Jane has more shine as an intelligent being.  During her stay in London, Jane has reached conclusions on her own:<br />1. The Bingley sisters are not her friends.<br />2. Charles Bingley is not her perfect suitor.<br /><br />Jane is emotionally free to form a new romance!<br /><br />A wise man once said that a woman deserved no credit for her beauty at sixteen, but beauty at sixty was her own soul's doing. ~ Marie Carmichael Stopes<br /><br />Lord Lyfford continues his attentions to Miss Bennet.  When he meets with his friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, he understands the man’s low spirits.<br /><br />The story follows the romances of both the Bennet sisters.  Jane’s story seemed to be more prominent but that may be just that her story is a departure from the norm.  Elizabeth’s story is closer to the usual JAFF tale.<br /><br />The sisters agree the Bennet family, as well as the village of Meryton, needs some warning about possible damages from George Wickham.  Elizabeth journeys home to speak to her father.  Lydia distinguishes herself once again, but with very different results from her family.  Hurrah for Mrs. Bennet!<br /><br />What is really beautiful needs no adorning. We do not grind down the pearl upon a polishing stone. ~ Sataka<br /><br />“More Than a Pretty Face” kept my interest to the end.  I loved the portrait of a stronger Jane.  I wondered if it should have been slanted more to be Jane’s story with Elizabeth’s romance as a sidelight.  I think Jane could have stood on her own in this one.<br /><br />Although the Bingleys are not the main players, the story has several good Caroline set-downs.  I always like those.<br /><br />“I must, however, thank you, dear Caro, for the extensive descriptions of Pemberley which you related last year. Because of your information, I am able to quite look forward to my new home, though I have yet to see it myself. Perhaps one day we shall meet there… if you are fortunate enough to secure an invitation from the mistress of the house.”<br /><br />Yeah, I always love a good comeuppance for our dear Caro!<br /><br />For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.<br />For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.<br />For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.<br />For beautiful hair, let a child run his fingers through it once a day.<br />For poise, walk with the knowledge that you will never walk alone...<br />~ Sam Levenson, In One Era and Out the Other, 1973<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",5.0,1,2022
2.5 Stars,"** spoiler alert ** I was lucky enough to win an ARC of this bad boy. I did enjoy this book. June was my favorite character I loved her sass and the smarta$s comments she threw at Drew. Drew oh man that dude took a good chunk of book to finally pull his head out and start fighting for his wife and learning to communicate. Not sure if he's redeemed or not, jury is still out on that. Noah I loved his and June's friendship and how he lifted her up when she needed it most. So all in all it's a solid debut novel and start to a series. I honestly won't be continuing though because of whats eluded at the ending, it just left a bad taste in my mouth. It is not a trope I like or can read but that's just my personal preference. I do recommend this book to anybody that enjoys a second chance cheating romance. 2.5 stars rounded up<br /><br />Edit to add: After thinking it over, i had to come back and change my review. I pride myself on being honest and forth coming when it comes to the reviews I leave. There were to many issues not addressed or addressed but not to my satisfaction. I still have a lot of issues with Drew and how protective he was with the OW. I think too much importance was placed on her and her feelings and not those of his wife. I ended it feeling like June came second to the OW. There was to much he wasn't willing to discuss out of respect for the OW which is a big no for me in the cheating books I read. I'm not even sure I would say he groveled, just that he got help to better himself but I felt like June did all the reaching out. So, unfortunately it was a miss for me. I am in the minority though so maybe give it a try<br /><br />Edit #2- Through several different sources I've learned that apparently all of these unanswered questions will be answered in book 2 but from the OW POV. That means this is not a standalone. Im lowering my rating dont market me a standalone with a HEA and then say if you want answers read book 2. That just ticks me off. Also big pet peave dont mess with a previous HEA and apparently what happens in book 2 will make us dislike Drew more. Obviously all this could change since the book isn't out but it has turned me off and I definitely won't be continuing even to find out the answers. Last edit and im out",2.0,0,2022
A New Twist on Time Travel,"Gillian McAllister's, ""Wrong Place, Wrong Time,"" offers a new twist on time travel.  The night after her teenaged son guns down a man right in front of their home, a mother begins a mysterious journey, where she is going backwards in time, one day at a time.  At first, everything in life prior to the shooting seems so normal, but she soon discovers that she was so wrapped up in her work and the hustle bustle of everyday life that she was missing some subtle changes in her son's routines and his group of friends.  After several days of living life in reverse, she concludes that this experience must serve a purpose.  She must find out what went wrong and stop it.  That is easier said than done.  She seeks out a scientist who believes in the possibility of time travel.  She tries her best to convince him that she is indeed living life backwards.  She gains his belief when she shares that the scientist will win a major award that he has just been nominated for based on some of his research. Once he believes her, he says that she may start to jump backwards in bigger chunks of time, and when that happens, the day chosen will not just be a random day - it will offer crucial clues to the sequences that led to the horrible result. That turns the mom into a detective in addition to a time traveler. Along the way, she gets some major shocks, including about her husband.  Has he lied about having no family?

"Good start, disappointing finish","This book started well, maintained a good pace, had an interesting story line and interesting characters through about the first third of the book.  Unfortunately, at that point, logic and believability went sideways and devolved into a sex-a-thon interrupted periodically by a menacing ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />It’s true that lovely, lively sex scene can spice up a novel, but in this novel as with so many, the sex scenes felt formulaic especially given that the heroine,Maggie, had just come out of a physically and sexually abusive relationship. Literally, from one day to the next day or two she’s going from substantial abuse at the hands of one man to vigorous sex that she initiates with a man she barely knows.  Because there’s so little initial relationship develop between the two main characters, there was very little chemistry or “hotness” in the anatomically described, tab-A-goes-into-slot-B, scenes.<br /><br />There were some other elements of the story that I had issues with, but the biggest is the author’s lack of trust in her/his readers. This book could have been much deeper and much more engaging had the author trusted the readers to keep reading even if the sex was a bit delayed.  There were many themes the author could have expanded on, but chose to ignore and that’s a pity.<br /><br />I also detest labeled chapters with alternating points of view in a novel. For this reader, it’s a signal that the author is unwilling or unable to develop distinctive voices for the characters and that again, he/she doesn’t trust the reader to be able to discern the differences among them.<br /><br />Bottom line:  What started off as a solid 4 star read dropped to a very disappointing two star read. Good original start; cliched, trope-filled ending.",2.0,0,2022
Fun fun fun,I just binge read the entire Expanse series and wasn't up for more drama. This was the perfect palate cleanser. What a great little adventure. I hope there is a sequel in the works.,5.0,1,2022
"takes more than half the book to get to point, first half is all ""fat squealing pig""","I read it, I thought about it, I am trying to be balanced in my review. Ultimately, I found it hard to work through this one. If you JUST overeat, and prefer a tough love semi shaming approach, then this *might* be worth it. If you at all have an actual eating disorder, especially in the anorexia or bulimia, or any disordered eating centered on big mindless binging, then please do not read this- your mental health is important.<br /><br /> It doesn't live up to expectation from what is written on this product page, and what I was reading about the author. The book takes a long time to get to the point (56% of the way through on Kindle), and the first half greatly reminds me of an advertisement. Saying a lot without saying much at all<br /><br />Ok much of my negativity is the style it is written. It reads like a click bait article or advertisement. It will use a whole page for a few screaming large cap words. Takes forever to get to the point, and even then it is buried and often goes off course to get there. It is distracting, and reduces my opinion of the information. <br /><br />The author makes a big point to say that if you dont like the phrasing ""Fat pig"" (or something like that) to not read this. He doesn't want negative reviews based on that. Well then maybe provide an excerpt using this exact wording so would be readers can make a choice BEFORE they buy the book. Not cool to say that it is our fault. Essentially states that you've been warned. That it is our fault--not his-- if we dont like it (*eye roll*). It worked for him to call his lizard brain a big fat squealing pig that needs to be starved (of attention), etc. He says that if we dont like calling our fat lizard a pig, then call it something you are more comfortable with. Ok, great... but he uses fat squeeling pig over and over and over and over that how can the reader avoid picking up that term in their mind for use. Then he has so called conversations with his fat squeeling pig-- there is endless commentary from this pig, and it is not at all useful or informative. Page filler, distracting, annoying.<br /><br />Further, he puts us all into the category of fat, or thin. Our thinking is fat, or thin. I dont know.. the info is off putting. It just doesnt read like it was from an educated professional with access to editing. Sounds like a stream of consciousness from a new writer. But this person has more than one book out.<br /><br />Over and over and over the info is basically-- we are fat pigs, er, our lizard brain is a fat pig, and we need to shut it up, we need to simply stop eating.<br /><br />For real.. just decide what is ok to eat, and only eat that, forever more. He likens it to following the law. That you cant just break it over and over again, so just follow the law and you will be fine. Sure.. because everyone with an eating disorder would be fixed if only we had the mental fortitude to stop eating. MAAAAAYBEEEEE those that simply over eat may find some value in this..<br /><br />But I cant recommend it. You do you. Read what you want. If it helps you.. awesome. Glad you feel better about yourself.<br /><br />I dont need hugs and assurances, but I dont need to be told to just stop eating, attribute my behavior to something else (fat pig, or other descriptor of choice), and that thin is good and fat is bad. It's weird. Maybe if it started off with solid info, the fat pig stuff would come across more meaningful.<br /><br />I didnt ""learn"" anything. I recommend, [[ASIN:0848732758 the BECK Diet Solution]] which is also based in cognitive behavior therapy but with a better approach.",1.0,0,2022
Please bring the old Dean Koontz back!,"I had great hopes for this book, I really did….I have been a Dean Koontz fan for a very long time & his first books, to me, were better than Stephen King stories..I bought all his books for many years…but the new ones I have purchased just are not the same caliber…something is very wrong here. This story was ok but it didn’t grab me & make me care about the characters like the old stories did…I used to finish the older books in one sitting because I was so enthralled I could not put them down…not so this one…it took me a month to force myself to finish it..the characters are lifeless, the plot is all over the place, there is just no connection with anyone, and the dog didn’t play much of a part like they usually do…Please bring the original Dean Koontz back!!",1.0,0,2022
So disappointing. Cliffhanger,"The story had many different sub plots related to the various characters. The main character went to Thistle island for a job as companion to an elderly woman. She had given her long term boyfriend an ultimatum about getting married, which he didn’t even take seriously. She spent more time trying to solve the mystery of notes in bottles than as a companion. The men in the story seemed to behave out of character. Just as the message mystery was PARTLY resolved, the book ends, with that and everyone else’s stories dangling. Not quite a waste of time, but very close.",1.0,0,2022
sweet romance but other aspects brought my rating down,"Code: Blue is the sequel to N.R. Walker’s first book about a band in its last stages of its life.  Code: Red was it’s last tour and the romance between its singer Maddox and his manager Roscoe.<br /><br />Code:Blue , the last album, signals the turmoil that’s ongoing between the band’s label, the band members and the unhealthy physical and mental health conditions they now find themselves in after years of constant touring and stress.<br /><br />Jeremy, the other band member that’s been a well defined character in Code: Red, gets his story and romance now.  Jeremy is physically breaking down under a decade’s worth of abusing his body and not listening to doctors instructions.  He’s a diabetic and his lack or inability to stay on target to the nutritional structure he needs to stay healthy has finally taken its toll.  He’s a mess. Jeremy is a wonderful character.  He’s well developed, and his personality as well as his diabetes is worked into this story extremely well. We get to know him, his trust issues, and his confusion over his sexuality. Steve , the narrator, is the other main character, and his love interest. Steve is a solid personality but the history and professional aspects seems forced to fit the story .<br /><br /> I liked and  got behind this couple’s romance. But it took an occasional suspension of belief in the professionalism here.<br /><br />I had to wonder why I was having issues with both stories. I honestly like Code: Blue better then the first book.<br /><br />And I think there’s several answers.<br /><br />Sexual Identity:<br /><br />Let me tackle the sexuality aspect first.  Why was the only choice Jeremy has when he’s so confused about why he’s now suddenly attracted to Steve is that you are either straight and now you’re bisexual. What happened to being pansexual or omnisexual?  Both made more sense here, but it’s as though they didn’t exist on the sexual spectrum. That bothers me.<br /><br />The Rock/Band/Theme:<br /><br />This element needs several sections to deal with. First because both novels could be standalone stories, without any attempt to attach them to a band theme.<br /><br />It’s that whole band theme is a one dimensional layer that’s just a element in name only, except for the songs written at the end of each story.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />First, the books are about the band and it’s musicians/rockstars.  But both are told ,not from the perspective of any of them but from someone who, however close, is not a musician and not a band member.  For me, that’s a odd choice to begin with.  That loss of an intimate viewpoint from a heart of a story is never made up for.<br /><br />These voices stay missing in other ways too.<br /><br />You have five members. The author makes much of the band’s symbol and the fact that they are brothers that can’t be broken apart.<br /><br />The two books?  Atrous the band? Nonexistent except that we see their label, managers, fans, and talking about the tours, the promotional lineups. Them actually on stage? No.<br /><br />Where’s the band? Where’s the on stage synergy ? That electric, everything is jamming, loud, louder, the crowds out of its mind, sweating, rocking, mind blowing synergistic feeling that rock bands truly exhibit only out on the stage?  I know writers who know how to pull that into their narrative when writing about musicians and bands.<br /><br />The band members.  Except for occasional appearances, the only defined members are Maddox and Jeremy.  The other three? One dimensional characters, basically character sketches.<br /><br />We get the band as it’s ending.  The last tour…we don’t actually get the tour.  Just some written songs at the end. Plus they tell us it’s the last tour.<br /><br />Code: Blue, the definition and reason for that name comes much like the first novel’s did, at the end of the story.  It signaled the last album.<br /><br />Ok . But we don’t get the guys putting together the album, the emotions, or anything at all of what it felt like to put a last album together.  So why a band theme at all?  It’s really missing in both books if you think about it.<br /><br />These guys could be any celebrities and their manager/ security guard. Doesn’t change a thing.<br /><br />Just seems like a half hearted effort.  This story and the other lack the rockstar synergy the rises out of any group of musicians who love music demonstrate when playing together.<br /><br />The people are tired, they are done.  It’s carried over into the narratives.<br /><br />Romances are fine. The main characters are nice, sweet, I especially liked the dog,  but there’s not much foundation.<br /><br />That’s not like Walker .<br /><br />Read it for the romance and if you’re a fan of this author.<br /><br />We “see” him through the loving eyes of his security manager/guard, Steve Frost.  The story is told from Steve’s perspective. A issue I talk about below.<br /><br />Steve is  good character.  Older , with a painful history, that tbh, didn’t seem realistic to need to be hidden given its the music industry.  He’s protection/security.  That element seemed a bit contrived.  I liked many aspects of Steve’s personality but there’s also others that fell short given how long he’s been in the business.",3.0,0,2022
"Good read, touches a lot of social issues in an approachable way","I enjoyed this book and the interwoven lives of the characters. I gave it 4 stars because parts of it seemed contrived, and the characters too extreme. That sounds really critical and those impressions were not throughout or for every character.

The main character is the king of Gary Stu's,"The best chapters of this story, writing-wise, are the ones where the main character doesn't appear at all.<br /><br />The author is in love with his protagonist and is determined that you WILL love him as well. The guy is a genius at everything, everyone likes him, literally. He's funny, kind, smart, hard-working, etc etc. He has no negative personality traits whatsoever and never makes a mistake. Every idea he suggests everyone instantly agrees with. Any chance he takes always pays off. Any time he needs money, some falls in his lap. Any stranger he meets always takes the time to teach him some rare skill or give him some useful tip. No one ever doesn't like him, and if they do, they are evil and are soon dealt with. No matter what rule he breaks, the teachers just tousle his hair and tell him not to do it again.<br /><br />All of his friends and teachers essentially exist just to praise him and have side conversations where they talk to each other about how amazing he is. Professors fight over who will mentor him. Thousand year old magicians think he is rare and amazing and are astonished at how cool he is. No consequence for any of his choices ever negatively impacts him. The story is just him going from the best day of his life to the next best day of his life, over and over. It's frankly just ridiculous.<br /><br />He is given a Mark that stops him from being an offensive combatant in any way at all, we're told, and then every chapter of the book he finds a way around that limitation. It's pointless because it doesn't stop him from killing everything he wants to kill. The main character's girlfriend is basically exactly the same thing. They both do something for an hour and are amazing at it, better than the experts. They each put on 20lbs of muscle a month or something silly like that. The whole thing is a fantasy really.<br /><br />To me the absolutely worst thing the author does is he constantly makes references to other movies, books, etc and seems to think that makes the book better somehow. Every chapter he will have the characters talk about Harry Potter, Star Wars, Jaws, Frankenstein or whatever and it's so immersion breaking that I can't believe the author thinks it's a good idea but apparently they do. I just think that is such a huge mistake I don't know what to even tell you about it. You want the reader to be able to lose themselves in the story and the constant references to other works makes that impossible.<br /><br />The author has picked up the habit of narrating fight scenes the way the 1960's Batman tv show did, with constant ""BAM!"" or ""POW!"" exclamations to punctuate strikes and that is beyond silly to me as well.<br /><br />This story is the opposite of ""show, don't tell"". You are explicitly told everything you are supposed to think about each character. If two people are in love, multiple characters will remark that they are in love. If a guy has a corny sense of humor, multiple characters will tell you that he has a corny sense of humor. If someone is a tough guy, multiple characters will tell you he's a tough guy. It would be so much smoother and more organic to just show the reader these things but apparently the author is scared that someone won't ""get it"" so everything has to be spelled out over and over.<br /><br />When the protagonist is not present, as in the chapters featuring the ""bad guys,"" none of these problems are present either. The narrative is fluid and engaging. As soon as the protagonist pops up, it goes back to being Gary Stu fan service. I know some people will be fine with that but I am not. I thought at first it was just a new author getting the hang of things but it becomes obvious that it's a series of deliberate choices they're making and it is just impossible to lose yourself in a fantasy story where everyone loves the hero all the time and the hero aces every test he takes and can outmaneuver gods and demons with no problem and basically just has everything go his way 100% of the time.<br /><br />So basically it's 2 stars for the constant repetitive praising of the hero and 5 stars for the great writing of every chapter the hero isn't in. The problem is that the hero isn't in about 1% of the chapters so there's just too much of the bad stuff to wade through.",2.0,0,2022
It is part of the saga,"A friend recommended this series to me.  Number 8 was on the public library shelf but I could not get into it because there was just too much back story.  Too many complex characters with only part of their character made known.  I gave up and went to #1 and read them in order.  I think with persistence some could be read out off order, but they are individual records of a long professional career. Chief Inspector Gamache does not have a clear path to professional advancement, or even to survival.  I thought the previous installment, 'Madness of Crowds' was a wonderfully fine capstone to the long story.  Then I got word of this one 'World of Curiosities'  It started as perhaps a stitching together of flashbacks from the many earlier scenes in the Inspector's long career.  The Ms Penny completely surprised me with a sudden locked door mystery or perhaps even a science fiction time travel narrative.  No, it  was all revealed in a final scene typical of many other's in the saga.<br /><br />Some editor really needs to go through all these books and produce a finely bound, printed in high quality paper, 'Wit and Wisdom of Inspector Garmache'  Now I smile every time someone asks me 'how are you?' and I reply -- I  am FINE.",5.0,1,2022
Good points but problematic context,"Megan O’Rourke boldly discusses her fecal transplant.  She includes graphic descriptions of the “colonic” that was part of the procedure.<br /><br />Gross, right?<br /><br />O’Rourke was sick with weird vague symptoms, she desperately wanted to get better, and she sought treatment via both traditional and alternative medicine. Along the way, she learned how to better accept her situation.  She over-shared and then turned coy and evasive, which began to seem dishonest.  Her science-y citations and footnotes? They don’t make this book “scholarly.”<br /><br />During the course of her illness, O’Rourke was told various things, like she had abnormal thallium levels, probably caused by eating kale (seems like a Dr. Oz thing).  She tries dry brushing, almond milk and all sorts of vaguely orthorexic sounding nutrition hacks.<br /><br />I get it — try anything to feel better — but it never hurts to apply informed skepticism to treatment options — traditional or alternative.<br /><br />(For the record, fecal transplants are used in treating patients who have C. diff infections, and can be life changing for ulcerative colitis patients. But for others who might be overly focused on their microbiome, the ‘transplants’ are popular, if expensive, and their efficacy is…questionable. )<br /><br />There is a lot of snake oil in the world.  It’s tragic that so many people are so turned off by the old school doctor model that snake oil looks so appealing.  Dubious science, dubious benefits, hard cold cash.  Alternative medicine is a gigantic multi-billion dollar industry.<br /><br />A highly regarded physician (MD) once told me — if those alternative treatments really worked?  We would all know it.<br /><br />I’m not saying that traditional Western medicine is all that great. Bear in mind that not long ago, any infection could be lethal, and doctors were like the guy in Deadwood, yanking teeth and applying poultices back behind the stable.<br /><br />There are other medical/illness memoirs out there—Lucia Perilla, Jessica Miller, Suleika Jaouad come to mind, and there are many more.  Or just read Susan Sontag and skip the rest.  These books say — listen to what happened to me, this is how I survived it, and how I managed, even if actual cures are elusive.  The underlying message is — you can probably survive, too.<br /><br />O’Rourke issues a challenge to reimagine chronic illness — which is good.  One hopes that the “long Covid” cases will drag the medical community and the rest of the healthy world into this long overdue reimagining.<br /><br />In the meantime, I worry that O’Rourke’s book offers a ringing endorsement of alternative treatments in a world that has already been upended by exactly that sort of pseudo-science/magical thinking.",2.0,0,2022
4 Wavering Stars,"Ok I debated back and forth on what to give this book but settled on a 4. It kept my interest, I read it straight through, it had just enough angsty moments to get my heart pounding/ tick me off. So ya its a 4.<br /><br />Ares was a 100% obsessed with Raven from the beginning. He may not of know what he was feeling because he was deep in the denial cave. That's not to say he didn't make some choices that royally ticked me off.  But man did he come through in the end and prove just how important Raven is to him. This man used his words and backed them up with actions.<br /><br />When you find out what actually went down at his sister's birthday party 5 years earlier, you can't help but feel for them both. Hannah is really a manipulative, selfish witch. I'm pleased to say she definitely reaped what she sowed.<br /><br />I'm excited to continue this series. Luca and Valentina's book is sure to be an angst fest with his overbearing, invasive grandma getting involved.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone that does NOT have issues with an h or H having been/dated/engaged to a sibling.

Well-curated collection,"Going into this collection, you need to know two things Bradbury seems to hate: Technology, and happy endings.<br /><br />Many of his works look at the emerging technology (in some cases, this is television) and project some horrid future based on it. The rest just find some other reason for the world to be terrible and the characters to be miserable. All Summer in a Day is the saddest story I remember from childhood. The world of Bradbury's stories is bleak, abysmal, often tyrranical, and over the course of the story, more often than not, things only get worse. I have yet to encounter a story of his where the characters end up happy.<br /><br />They are also throught provoking, and often there is a layer of story beneath the story. The Veldt is especially interesting because you can read it two ways. Peter and Wendy's VR system (and that really was was the nursery was) suddenly produced physical objects from nowhere, with no hardware by which to do so, and without the inventors or manufacturers knowing it has that capability, or the parents, who didn't even investigate screams in their own home, were nuts. It's a different, even darker story if you question the sanity of these parents and of a psychitrist who claims to have never encountered a fact in his life.<br /><br />This is a good collection, containing a large number of his most famous, most celebrated works.

Must read,"Installment #4 in Zeihan's running commentary hits the mark. Zeihan's basic demographic, economic, and geographic premise began in 2014. He has been spot-on. Globalization is on the deathbed as he predicted. That's 'good' and 'bad' depending on where you are the time. The USA is the clear hegemon as the 22nd century begins. Decisive, data-driven, and reasoned alternatives are required to envision the century unfolding diffferently. The US is pulling back from the post-WW2 guaranteed global prosperity that created the EU and PRC economic powerhouses. US citizens frankly do not care about global. We see a populist active disinterest beyond the US. It's a 'C' priority at best. The pain of the last 75 years has been too much. Nothing nationalistic about it. I believe he is correct. The global cop task has grown too expensive, too bloody, with too little return as more countries actively work against the post-WW2 order.<br /><br />The US and, more broadly, North American success will emerge as the sole economic growth engine as a direct function of geography, infrastructure, skill sets, and resource abundance. These combine with the demonstrated ability to assimilate many immigrants within a law-bound enterprise to grow economically. The North American road to present USMCA integration has not been 'easy.' But, the integration will continue. North America's undisputed global economic dominance by the opening of the 22nd century is frankly inevitable.<br /><br />As a quant myself, the widely available data and Zeihan's narrative to integrate the information is easily accessible by readers reasonably familiar with the central topics. Moreover, Zeihan handily packages the otherwise diverse statistics and data pieces into a coherent, rational framework.<br /><br />Zeihan's arguments from data reflect a normal distribution of possibilities and challenges. In the 6th sigma worst case, nuclear war (my words) among the three economic blocs contending for dominance. For the EU and China centric economic blocs, it is quite literally 'if not now, never'. North American economic power emerges more quickly, perhaps by 2170, at the other end of the distribution. Global Realpolitik must be resolved internally among EU and PRC regions of influence.<br /><br />Both the PRC and the EU are beyond the demographic tipping point. Organic, internal growth is over. The decline is present and glaringly clear extrapolated to mid-century. A far different political map will emerge to usher a new order.<br /><br />The US best case is to sit the Eurasian Realpolitik out. New blocs and new centers must evolve more naturally than the post-WW2 American-enforced peace order. Once protected under the US post-WW2 order, the far corners alone and en extremis dependent on energy and food are hammered by hostile waters.<br /><br />I felt that Zeihan occasionally weighs too heavily on the scale of the terrible conflict before mid-century. But, as we see in Ukraine, he may be right.",5.0,1,2022

Far fetched,"Like so many thrillers this book started off with a gripping premise. Paul, an unreliable narrator, now living with his girlfriend Jenna receives a message from his ex-fiancé, Nicole. He is gobsmacked because he knows she is dead and he knows this because he killed her.<br /><br />From here the story builds with bits and pieces meant as red herrings but because I cared for neither Paul nor Jenna I wasn't invested in the outcome. My lack of concern for both characters is based on each being both ridiculous and stupid. What type of person finds a box of clothes belonging to her boyfriend's former fiancé and wears the clothes? Even less credible is Jenna finding Nicole's diary and instead of reading it cover to cover repeatedly climbs up to the attic despite being pregnant and photographs a few pages at a time to read on her phone. <br /><br />Paul levitates between telling everyone he is not drinking while swiging from a vodka bottle even while at school (he's a teacher) and popping pills. In line for a promotion as deputy head, his behaviour is bizarre with him breaking into Nicole's former therapist's office to read Nicole's file. This becomes farcical when he chooses to become a patient of the same therapist. Her technique is more in keeping with a herbalist than a medical professional. 3 stars.",3.0,0,2022
"Elizabeth Bennet:  Miss Judge, Miss Construe and Miss Conception","Miss Judge, with a mind warped by the strongest prejudices, this lady exalts herself to pronounce sentence upon people's words and actions. She is closely related to Miss Construe and Miss Conception, to whom she is warmly attached, and greatly influenced by their counsel. ~ Angeline E. Alexander, ""A Sisterhood of Spinsters,"" 1885<br /><br />“A Most Excellent Understanding” begins with Elizabeth Bennet’s walk with Colonel Fitzwilliam when he gossips about Fitzwilliam Darcy’s success in saving a man he assumes to be Charles Bingley from a most imprudent marriage.<br /><br />Elizabeth’s reaction varies from canon:  “You see, Mr. Darcy separated his friend from my sister Jane because of her family. More specifically, he separated them because of me.”<br /><br />Colonel Fitzwilliam does not follow Elizabeth’s logic.  In fact, he must attempt to change the course of the non-courtship without any solid evidence.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  He could only rely on the evidence of the two principals' interactions at Rosings and second-hand reports of their time in Hertfordshire. He felt as though he had to commit his troops to battle with no intelligence but three scouts, all drunk, delivering contradictory reports.<br /><br />I've learned this about judging people — you can have all the facts and not know the true story. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />The story continues in London where Darcy visits the Bennet sisters at the Gardiners’ home.  He begins at the beginning with apologies to both Jane and Elizabeth.  Will his apology be accepted?  How about this for the sisters’ reactions:<br /><br />Jane protested angrily and vigorously. “I had no idea that you too were judging me, sir. Every hour of every day, I must try to please and pay heed to my mother, my father, my suitor, the neighbourhood gossips, and the rules of propriety — all while being completely unaware that I had to please you as well! Show too much affection and I am forward. Show too little and I am mercenary. You really do take on too much, sir. The path is not narrow. It is non-existent!”<br /><br />Elizabeth wanted to scream… or to throw something... or worst of all, agree.<br /><br />Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike. ~ Oscar Wilde<br /><br />The best parts of this story involve the secondary characters.<br /><br />Colonel Fitzwilliam deals with George Wickham, once and for all.  He also has a clever way with coins to explain the financial facts of life to Lydia Bennet.  Loved it!<br /><br />Lady Catherine accepts a decision from Anne and puts her talents to better use.  Charles Bingley and the younger Bennet sisters are the benefactors.<br /><br />Georgiana deals with the Bingley shrew — uh, the lovely Miss Caroline.<br /><br />And Jane has a Brain!  I loved her!<br /><br />We are each burdened with prejudice; against the poor or the rich, the smart or the slow, the gaunt or the obese. It is natural to develop prejudices. It is noble to rise above them. ~ Author unknown<br /><br />I have been a fan of this author since his first stories appeared on FF-net.  I even read to the end of the story about Math!  Congratulations to Wade for taking that giant step into publication.  I recommended his stories to friends at GoodReads when they were non-published.

pacing issues,"I mostly liked this. I liked the characters. I liked the overall story. But the story needs editing. Too much time is spent before they meet in the beginning chapters. Then we get a marriage of convenience, and that’s wasted. Like, use the marriage to push them together and let the reader fall in love as they are. But no, they just stay mostly apart. Then they finally get together, but can’t communicate enough to make the most of it.<br /><br />Minor spoiler:<br /><br />Read at own risk<br /><br />Not that big of a deal.<br /><br />But don’t say I didn’t warn you.<br /><br />Eliza says I love you way too soon. Why does she love him? Because the sex was good? They barley knew each other. It was too soon for Edward. It was too soon for the reader—at least me! It may not have been if the marriage of convenience hadn’t been wasted.<br /><br />I really did like the story and characters overall. I just think better editing could have helped the pacing. And losing the lack of communication/purposeful convo shut downs would have helped the story and growth of their relationship.",3.0,0,2022
Another Amazing Read!,"There are only a few authors that can truly put the outside world on hold while I escape in the pages of a great story. Even fewer are those whose science is excellent and yet broken down into easy to understand bites. This authors consistently writes authoritatively about the science, mixes in real life history with personal experience that adds a layer of believability missing in so many “popular” books. I highly recommend “Lost in time”. Many authors deal in time travel, often with paradox & multiverse theories, but so few fit seamlessly together like this one. Enjoy an escape from reality while realizing afterword the very concepts you have been thinking on as you read this book may contain the answers to today’s concerns: How do we get our country back? Do I matter in the big picture? Well worth the time investment!",5.0,1,2022

Contrasts history and religion with projected impact of artificial intelligence and bio-technology,"This 2018 book entitled: “21 Lessons for the 21st Century” by Yuval Noah Harari was a thought-provoking look at the future and the impact of technology including artificial intelligence (AI) and bio-technology. The book is worth purchasing and reading but the 21 lessons were a bit obscure, at least to this reviewer, notwithstanding that the book contained 21 chapters.  Moreover, whether or not the author is a good prognosticator of the future remains to be seen; none-the-less some of his predictions, may help individuals do contingency planning.  Harari veers off into a variety of personal views important to him and undoubtedly of interest to some others. Some will find his historical look at various world religions as academic and informative while others might be offended.<br /> Illustrative of style and content of this book, Harari writes: “My first book, Sapiens, surveyed the human past, examining how an insignificant ape became the ruler of planet Earth. Homo Deus, my second book, explored the long-term future of life... In this book I… zoom in on the here and now, but without losing the long-term perspective.”<br /> Harari writes: “A single mother struggling to raise two children in a Mumbai slum is focused on where she will find their next meal; refugees in a boat in the middle of the Mediterranean scan the horizon for any sign of land... They all have far more urgent problems than global warming or the crisis of liberal democracy… Climate change may be far beyond the concerns of people in the midst of a life-and-death emergency, but it might eventually make the Mumbai slums uninhabitable, send enormous new waves of refugees across the Mediterranean, and lead to a worldwide crisis in healthcare.”<br /> Harari writes: “this book is intended… as a selection of lessons. These lessons…  aim to stimulate further thinking… The merger of infotech and biotech might soon push billions of humans out of the job market and undermine both liberty and equality. Big Data… algorithms might create digital dictatorships in which all power is concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite while most people suffer not from exploitation but from something far worse—irrelevance… Philosophers are very patient people, but engineers are far less so, and investors are the least patient of all… Humans think in stories rather than in facts, numbers, or equations, and the simpler the story, the better.”<br /> Harari writes: “Some… just don’t want to give up their racial, national, or gendered privileges. Others have concluded (rightly or wrongly) that liberalization and globalization are a huge racket empowering a tiny elite at the expense of the masses… The liberal political system was shaped during the industrial era to manage a world of steam engines, oil refineries, and television sets. It has difficulty dealing with the ongoing revolutions in information technology and biotechnology…”<br /> Harari writes: “Democracy is based on Abraham Lincoln’s principle that “you can fool all the people some of the time, and some people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.”… Russia is one of the most unequal countries in the world, with 87 percent of wealth concentrated in the hands of the richest 10 percent of people… Humans vote with their feet… I have met numerous people in many countries who wish to immigrate to the United States… But I have yet to meet a single person who dreams of immigrating to Russia… For every Muslim youth from Germany who traveled to the Middle East to live under a Muslim theocracy, probably a hundred Middle Eastern youths would have liked to make the opposite journey and start a new life for themselves in liberal Germany… throughout the world… even if they describe themselves as “anti-liberal,” none of them rejects liberalism wholesale. Rather, they… want to pick and … choose their own dishes from a liberal buffet… Even some of the staunchest supporters of democracy… have become decidedly lukewarm about allowing too many immigrants in.”<br /> Harari writes: “But liberalism has no obvious answers to the biggest problems we face: ecological collapse and technological disruption... [In] the twentieth century, each generation—[worldwide]—enjoyed better education, superior healthcare and larger incomes than the one that came before it… [But] the… prospect of… unemployment—leaves nobody indifferent… Some believe that… within… a mere decade or two, billions of people will become economically redundant. Others maintain that even in the long run automation will keep generating new jobs and greater prosperity for all... Fears that automation will create massive unemployment go back to the nineteenth century, and so far they have never materialized.”<br /> Harari writes: “What we are facing is not the replacement of millions of individual human workers by millions of individual robots and computers; rather, individual humans are likely to be replaced by an integrated network… AI doctors could provide far better and cheaper healthcare… particularly for those who currently receive no healthcare… at all… a poor villager in an underdeveloped country might come to enjoy far better healthcare via her smartphone...”<br /> Harari writes: “in the long run no job will remain absolutely safe from automation… After IBM’s chess program Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in 1997, humans did not stop playing chess. Rather, thanks to AI trainers, human chess masters became better than ever, and at least for a while human-AI teams known as “centaurs” outperformed both humans and computers in chess… A closer look at the world of chess might indicate where things are heading… [In] 2017, a critical milestone was reached, not when a computer defeated a human at chess—that’s old news—but when Google’s AlphaZero program defeated the Stockfish 8 program. Stockfish 8 was the world’s computer chess champion for 2016. It had access to centuries of accumulated human experience in chess... It was able to calculate seventy million chess positions per second. In contrast, AlphaZero performed only eighty thousand such calculations per second, and its human creators had not taught it any chess strategies—not even standard openings. Rather, AlphaZero used the latest machine-learning principles to self-learn chess by playing against itself. Nevertheless, out of a hundred games the novice AlphaZero played against Stockfish, AlphaZero won twenty-eight and tied seventy-two. It didn’t lose even once. Since AlphaZero had learned nothing from any human, many of its winning moves and strategies seemed unconventional to the human eye… guess how long it took AlphaZero to learn chess from scratch, prepare for the match… against Stockfish, and develop its genius instincts? Four hours. That’s not a typo... AlphaZero went from utter ignorance to creative mastery in four hours, without the help of any human guide.”<br /> Harari writes: “even after self-driving vehicles prove themselves safer and cheaper than human drivers, politicians and consumers might nevertheless block the change for… decades… Government regulation can successfully block new technologies even if they are commercially viable and economically lucrative… For example… human “body farms” in underdeveloped countries and an almost insatiable demand from desperate affluent buyers. Such body farms could well be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet regulations have prevented free trade in human body parts”<br /> Harari writes: “In the stock exchange… algorithms are becoming the most important buyers of bonds, shares, and commodities… The Google search algorithm [ranks] the web pages of ice cream vendors… the Google algorithm ranks first—[NOT] those that produce the tastiest ice cream… When I publish a book, my publishers ask me to write a short description that they use for publicity online. But they have a special expert who… goes over my text and says, “Don’t use this word—use that word instead. Then we will get more attention from the Google algorithm…”<br /> Harari writes: “with the rise of AI… cheap unskilled labor will become far less important… If AI and 3-D printers indeed take over from the Bangladeshis… the revenues that previously flowed to South Asia will now [flow] California.”<br /> Harari writes: “Within a few decades, Big Data algorithms informed by a constant stream of biometric data could monitor our health 24/ 7. They might be able to detect the very beginning of influenza, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease, long before we feel anything is wrong with us. They could then recommend appropriate treatments, diets… custom-built for our unique physique, DNA, and personality… by 2050, thanks to biometric sensors and Big Data algorithms, diseases may be diagnosed and treated long before they lead to pain or disability… when you apply to your bank for a loan, it is likely that your application will be processed by an algorithm rather than by a human being. The algorithm analyzes lots of data about you and statistics about millions of other people and decides whether you are reliable enough to receive a loan.”<br /> Harari writes: “Today, the richest 1 percent own half the world’s wealth… the richest one hundred people together own more than the poorest four billion… If new treatments for extending life and upgrading physical and cognitive abilities prove to be expensive, humankind might split into biological castes… Humans and machines might merge so completely that humans will not be able to survive at all if they are disconnected from the network.”<br /> Harari writes: “the “clash of civilizations” thesis is false. Human groups—all the way from small tribes to huge civilizations—are fundamentally different from animal species, and historical conflicts differ greatly from natural selection processes… human groups may have distinct social systems, but these are not genetically determined, and they seldom endure for more than a few centuries…”<br /> Harari writes: “distortions of ancient traditions characterize all religions… The heated argument about the true essence of Islam is simply pointless. Islam has no fixed DNA. Islam is whatever Muslims make of it… Species often split, but they never merge. About seven million years ago chimpanzees and gorillas had common ancestors… Since individuals belonging to different species cannot produce fertile offspring together, species can never merge… Human tribes, in contrast, tend to coalesce over time into larger… groups… Ten thousand years ago humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes. With each passing millennium, these fused into… larger groups… remaining civilizations have been blending into a single global civilization…”<br /> Harari writes: “People across the globe are not only in touch with one another, they increasingly share identical beliefs and practices… Today, if you happen to be sick… you will be taken to similar-looking hospitals, where you will meet doctors in white coats who learned the same scientific theories in the same medical colleges. They will follow identical protocols and use identical tests to reach very similar diagnoses…”<br /> Harari writes: “Humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years and have survived numerous ice ages and warm spells… cities, and complex societies have existed for no more than ten thousand years. During this period… Earth’s climate has been relatively stable… [but now] climate change is a present reality…[and] Humanity has very little time left to wean itself from fossil fuels… the mark of science is the willingness to admit failure and try a different tack… Over the centuries… the… world has increasingly become a single civilization. When things really work, everybody adopts them.”<br /> Harari writes: “global warming is a fact, but there is no consensus regarding the best economic reaction to this threat… Ancient scriptures are just not good guides for modern economics… religion doesn’t really have much to contribute to the great policy debates of our time… Religions still have a lot of political power… As more and more humans cross more and more borders in search of jobs, security, and a better future, the need to confront, assimilate, or expel strangers strains political systems… about immigration… it would perhaps be helpful to view immigration as a deal with three basic conditions or terms: TERM 1: The host country allows the immigrants in… TERM 2: In return, the immigrants must embrace at least the core norms and values of the host country, even if that means giving up some of their traditional norms and values... TERM 3: If the immigrants assimilate to a sufficient degree, over time they become equal and full members of the host country… When people argue about immigration, they often confuse the four debates…[and Harari explains... ]”<br /> Harari writes: “Racism was seen not only as morally abysmal but also as scientifically bankrupt. Life scientists… anthropologists, sociologists, historians, behavioral economists, and even brain scientists have accumulated a wealth of data for the existence of significant differences between human cultures… most people concede the existence of at least some significant differences between human cultures, in things ranging from sexual mores to political habits… consider the way different cultures relate to strangers, immigrants, and refugees. Not all cultures are characterized by exactly the same level of acceptance… Norms and values that are appropriate in one country just don’t work well under different circumstances… [and goes on to suggest] let’s imagine two fictional countries: Coldia and Warmland… Much the same thing happens to Coldians who immigrate to Warmland… Both of these cases may seem to smack of racism. But in fact, they are not racist. They are “culturist.” People continue to conduct a heroic struggle against traditional racism without noticing that the battlefront has shifted. Traditional racism is waning, but the world is now full of “culturists.”… Today, in contrast, while many individuals still make such racist assertions, they have lost all of their scientific backing and most of their political respectability—unless they are rephrased in cultural terms.”<br /> Harari writes: “The shift from biology to culture is not just a meaningless change of jargon. It is a profound shift with far-reaching practical consequences, some good, some bad. For starters, culture is more malleable than biology. This means, on one hand, that present-day culturists might be more tolerant than traditional racists—… In many cases there is little reason to adopt the dominant culture, and in many other cases it is… an all but impossible mission… A second key difference… is that unlike traditional racist bigotry, culturist arguments might occasionally make good sense, as in the case of Warmland and Coldia. Warmlanders and Coldians really have different cultures, characterized by different styles of human relations. Since human relations are crucial to many jobs, is it unethical for a Warmlander firm to penalize Coldians for behaving in accordance with their cultural legacy?”<br /> Harari writes: “The last few decades have been the most peaceful era in human history. Whereas in early agricultural societies human violence caused up to 15 percent of all human deaths, and in the twentieth century it caused 5 percent, today it is responsible for only 1 percent… The greatest victory in living memory—of the United States over the Soviet Union—was achieved without any major military confrontation… Like the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and Iran, Israel seems to understand that in the twenty-first century the most successful strategy is to sit on the fence and let others do the fighting for you.”<br /> Harari writes: “All social mammals, such as wolves, dolphins, and monkeys, have ethical codes, adapted by evolution to promote group cooperation… “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal” were well known in the legal and ethical codes of Sumerian city-states, pharaonic Egypt, and the Babylonian Empire… A thousand years before the prophet Amos… the Babylonian king Hammurabi explained that the great gods had instructed him “to demonstrate justice within the land, to destroy evil and wickedness, to stop the mighty exploiting the weak… Many biblical laws copy rules that were accepted in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Canaan centuries and even millennia prior to the establishment of the… kingdoms of Judah and Israel.”<br /> Harari writes: “Unfortunately, for other people religious belief actually stokes and justifies their anger, especially if someone dares to insult their god or ignores His wishes… As the last few centuries have proved, we don’t need to invoke God’s name in order to live a moral life. Secularism can provide us with all the values we need… many of the secular values are shared by various religious traditions… Secular education teaches us that if we don’t know something, we shouldn’t be afraid of acknowledging our ignorance and looking for new evidence… Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”<br /> Harari writes: “behavioral economists and evolutionary psychologists have demonstrated that most human decisions are based on emotional reactions and heuristic shortcuts rather than on rational analysis, and that while our emotions and heuristics were perhaps suitable for dealing with life in the Stone Age, they are woefully inadequate in the Silicon Age… As Socrates observed more than two thousand years ago, the best we can do… is to acknowledge our own individual ignorance.”<br /> Harari writes: “In trying to comprehend and judge moral dilemmas people often resort to one of four methods. The first is to downsize the issue… The second method is to focus on a touching human story that ostensibly stands for the whole conflict… The third method of dealing with large-scale moral dilemmas is to weave conspiracy theories… These three methods try to deny the true complexity of the world. The fourth and ultimate method is to create a dogma, put our trust in some allegedly all-knowing theory, institution, or chief, and follow it wherever it leads us. Religious and ideological dogmas are still highly attractive in our scientific age precisely because they offer us a safe haven from the frustrating complexity of reality.”<br /> Harari writes: “Even the most religious people would agree that all religions, except one, are fictions… that does not mean that these fictions are necessarily worthless or harmful…  you cannot organize masses of people effectively without relying on some mythology. If you stick to unalloyed reality, few people will follow you… If you want to gauge group loyalty, requiring people to believe an absurdity is a far better test than asking them to believe the truth… if all your neighbors believe the same outrageous tale, you can count on them to stand together in times of crisis… When most people see a dollar bill, they forget that it is just a human convention… We learn to respect holy books in exactly the same way we learn to respect paper currency”<br /> Harari writes: “How can we prepare ourselves and our children for a world of such unprecedented transformations and radical uncertainties?... people need the ability to make sense of information, to tell the difference between what is important and what is unimportant, and above all to combine many bits of information into a broad picture of the world… Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching “the four Cs”—critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity… Most important of all will be the ability to deal with change, learn new things, and preserve.”<br /> Harari writes: “Planet Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and humans have existed for at least 2 million years… As for the future, physics tells us that planet Earth will be absorbed by an expanding sun about 7.5 billion years from now and that our universe will continue to exist for at least 13 billion years more.”",4.0,1,2022

Nothing in this book felt special.,"I keep looking for dungeon core books that excite and interest me.  There have been a few, but it seems that the majority end up boring me more than they should.  This one ended up falling into many of the normal traps of the genre.<br /><br />First, while in this story the soul making the core retains memories and ideals, that didn't actually give him a heroic character (even though he ""dies"" heroically before becoming a core.)  He's another very weak-willed character with little spirit and that's only made worse by the usual aspects of coredom in which he has no hands nor any real mobility.<br /><br />Second, the enemy was overwhelmingly powerful which forced the usual plot armor as well as way over-the-top fight antics.  This is probably my biggest issue with these stories.  The idea of a proportional enemy and a slow buildup of character has been lost in this genre.  Instead we have a dungeon that has to rapidly build up its power to confront an enemy that is vastly superior in every way.<br /><br />In the end, its not a bad tale.  The plot is there, and the story did not have any huge problems in pacing.  The writing quality is about standard for the genre as well.<br /><br />However, that only gets a story to 3 stars with me.  I have to be interested and wanting to read more to consider giving it four stars and with the fact that this story just felt like so many other dungeon core stories with the lack of character and the development of characters being so stunted due to the bad power levels, it ended up being a story I consider very average.  I don't say ""don't read it."", but unless you love the genre, I'll say, there are better stories out there.",3.0,0,2022
What's with the xoxo in her emails,"After reading this book I am less a fan of Katie. I admire her cancer work but it is obvious that she is part of the problem with so called journalists today. They aren't journalists, they just tell you how you should view and interpret the news. Sadly this started years ago when ""pundits"" starting appearing on newscasts. I wish she hadn't used so many acronyms, I couldn't figure them all out and I am a college graduate.  She names people I never heard of nor care about too. And what is with these xoxo's in emails???? I write these in letters in corresponding with my Grandchildren, not adults nor professionals. Another problem, too much in the book about racism and all the other claptrap the Left whines about all the time. I get it.........she's a lefty and has no tolerance for anyone who is a conservative. She doesn't belong in journalism. I lived in Europe for 20 year., when you watched the local news in Germany or England,  the news reader READ the news, they did not pontificate or ""interpret"" the news. In America I find that the media thinks we mere peasants cannot understand the news.  Worst of all was her betrayal of her late husband.  He wasn't there to defend himself and her daughters are obvioiusly brainwashed from their la ti da educations.  I am no fan of the Confederacy. I have two Greatgreat Grandfathers who fought in the Civil War on the Union side and were against slavery. It sounds like Katie is taking the guilt she feels about her ancestor's beliefs and projecting it on everyone. We cannot help what our ancestors did or thought but we can learn our history so we are the better for it.  I am not into re-enacting but for those who are, it is their hobby and usually they are harmless lovers of history.  I got sick of her Left wing whining in this book. As for the Matt Lauer situation, I find it impossible that she knew nothing of this, me thinks she does protest too much. If she really thought he was innocent and really was a friend, she would have gone to him and talked about it rather than the dithering she did. She comes off as disloyal to ""friends"" and her departed husband, and as an elitist. Dropping fashion names, celebrity names, fancy restaurants etc. etc.. Ann Curry and Deborah Norville need our sympathy. Katie does not.",1.0,0,2022
kept waiting for it to get better,"There was so much early plot of just the maid working under the typical cruel rich boss that makes her so ridiculous work and frequently gaslights her for seemingly no reason. That section of the book stretched on for waaayyy too long though. Also the fat-phobic and anti-mental health comments just made the main character so hatable that I can’t get past it for the rest of the book. Honestly all of the characters are pretty hatable, so I don’t know what is supposed to motivate me as a reader to want a happy ending for any of them. The only reason I finished the book was out of curiosity for how it would end and it was a pretty simple ending. Honestly I would just give this one a pass if I were you.",1.0,0,2022

"""The seahorses are at it again!"" 😂😂😂","That was a sentence I never expected to read from an incredible character's voice that was as unique as it was, in the context of the story at that time, hilarious, and made me laugh out loud!  I finished this book a couple weeks ago and, thinking about the story again today, this insightful warning came to mind and brought another smile.  I won't lie, it took a few chapters for me to get into the story, different characters in different settings? How do they relate to each other and the story? Do I care? And do I care enough to continue? Yes, I ended up caring very much and so glad I persevered!  It was worth it. Real people in real life situations - the humans anyway - not sure about the non-humans!  True humanity with the pain, grief, redemption, joy and all feelings that really happen in true lives - which means there's a lot of reality in this work of fiction!

An amazing read!,"I got this book because of the summary and I enjoy reading about different experiences/point of views. Once I started reading I couldn't stop! I wanted to know what was next, but I also wanted to stop for a bit to really think about the way white supremacy and euro-centric ideals (beauty and otherwise) can affect children at such a young age. I remember seeing and hearing the studies she mentions in the book, but I never really thought about it. I could sort of relate to her thoughts about herself when she was younger, and how those feelings and thoughts are still with me in adulthood. I felt like I was on a journey of my own self-reflection reading as I was reading. This book helped me more understand - or get a glimpse of - what other people went and still go though as children to adulthood and the trauma that white supremacy causes. It's ingrained in our society (and all over the world) and it's effects are damaging. Reading this I felt anger, sadness, humor, empathy, and thoughtfulness. It really is a wonderful, insightful, and inspiring! didn't think my review would be so long, but I really really enjoyed this book and I hope you will too. :)",5.0,1,2022

When too much is never enough,"This memoir is an intriguing but at times tiresome account of a crime family’s rise and fall as they made and lost unimaginable sums of money and lived the life of excess few would even believe possible. The story is told through the lens of the scion of a self-made Mexican-Italian mafioso. The story is braggadocios bravado tied together with some tales of some pretty epic criminal exploits.  La Greca Jr is selective in his telling, for instance only alluding that his father informed for the FBI once and then never mentioning it again. His biases are on full display as he often apologetically makes excuses for the family members he favors while condemning the ones he chooses to make the villains. But there are no heroes in this tale. Even for all the contempt he shows for his father near the end La Greca Jr, like all the family, was happy so long as his father “Jefe” was keeping him  stocked with enough money to rub elbows with Prince Charles, Sylvester Stallone, and the Royal families of Malaysia. And for all the love he professes for his grandfather, he was terrible to his grandmother near the end. So the real story is between the lines, and from the glimpses you get it is a doozie. The real strength of this memoir is how over the top the characters, their exploits and their lifestyle was. It’s a captivating read. Even when they had far too much, it was never enough and ultimately their appetites, scheming, vanities and excesses would bring them crashing down. I am intrigued by the question of what made “Jefe” (who is described as such a deeply flawed character here and in no way a role model) so successful at crime when other criminal wannabes were not. There are probably lessons worth learning somewhere in there. Some of his insights might include: look for opportunities in the midst of upheavals, deal with people directly, know what the other guy wants and be sure he gets his cut of it, favor bold action, build a network, and seek expert advice when something is outside your expertise. This is an intriguing read and would make a fantastic movie or tv series if the lens was moved away from La Greca Jr and more into the action. It’s kind of like a real life Sopranos. Snakes do eat snakes even if Jr doesn’t admit it to himself.",4.0,1,2022
NOT The Complete Expanse Story Collection,"What a rip off. With the name being ""Memory's Legion: The Complete Expanse Story Collection (The Expanse)"" I expected it to be the complete expanse stories, from 1st book to last book.

Instead I got a collection of short stories and nothing to do with the main stories that the TV series is based on.<br /><br />1 star because of the deceptive description, nothing to do with the quality of the stories.

"Quirky, individual take on colors","I enjoyed reading this book. Lots of facts, lots of footnotes and citations. If you paint, you may be especially interested.<br /><br />One oddity is the stream of consciousness writing style. The author starts telling a story, then interrupts themselves to wander down another fascinating byway of information, then wanders away into another story. Sometimes the author returns to the original story with an uninformative one-liner epigraphical or humorous quip at the end of a section. Sometimes you'll find the rest of the story in the footnotes. Most of the time you're on your own to find out the rest of the story.<br /><br />Also, the author often uses terms without defining or explaining them, leaving the reader to frequently consult Google for definitions and explanations.<br /><br />I docked one star for these problems.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book.

"Mercy is back, and so is the walking stick!","I always await the latest Mercy book from Patricia Briggs with great anticipation, and delighted in this latest installment.  Mercy and Adam join the Goblin King in solving the mysterious disappearance of the vampire seethe, as well as her vampire friend, Stefan, and his family.  When they begin to search out the disappearance of Wulfe, the ancient vampire who is a bit insane and a lot dangerous, they discover the other disappearances, plus local witches and more have gone missing.<br /><br />It's a public relations nightmare as the residents of the Tri-Cities area, both natural and un-natural, begin to wonder if they're safe there, as promised by the Columbia Basin Wolf Pack, or if they're being victimized by the Pack members.  Packs have never before taken an interest in protecting non-members and the weak, but Mercy's off-the-cuff announcement of a sanctuary and promised protection has lured a lot of new residents of ALL kinds.  These folk have always fled the strong and dangerous vampires and fey, and had just started to settle in, thinking they'd found a forever home.<br /><br />Was that a mistake on their part?  Were they lured there as bait or prey?<br /><br />Cryptic communications tell Mercy that Stefan is still in existence, but it's mysterious as to his status.  Wulfe might be killing people.  Stefan might be killing people.<br /><br />There's more about Zee, the iron-kissed fae, in this book, and he plays a major part in the investigation.  After a battle with spider-like fae, a mystic warning from Stefan sends Mercy to Zee to have her hands and feet inspected for any penetrating spines.  It turns out that she has a significant infestation of the spines, which will turn into eggs and a nursery for fae if not removed.  Zee spends hours cleaning the alien infestation from her body, then joins the search for a mysterious serial killer using a fae artifact to slice and dice people.  Zee has always had a mission to search out fae artifacts, particularly magical and dangerous ones, and take them into his care so that they don't get into the wrong hands.  The sickle used by The Harvester was presented to him 40 years ago, but now it looks as though he was fooled with a look-alike object.<br /><br />The walking stick has returned from disintegration and has resumed its duties as a guardian of Mercy.  That's a good thing, because she's going to need all the help she can get.",5.0,1,2022
Hard to imagine the characters being dumber than they already are.,"I liked the idea.  I thought that the world building had potential, although there are some huge holes in the foundation that ruin parts.  However the biggest issue I had was the sheer stupidity of the characters.  They are so heavily controlled by the author's decisions, to the point that they kept making completely illogical decisions seemingly because the author required them to act that way in order for the flawed plot to work.<br /><br />I don't want to post a more complete and detailed point by point analysis of what turned me off to this tale.  Honestly, it would both be too long, and would perhaps drive away a potential reader who can ignore the illogic that had me nearly raging.  I did finish this book, and I have to give the dual authors credit for the overall quality of the writing.  I didn't detect any obvious errors in grammar or spelling, or at least none were memorable.<br /><br />But I find I can't forgive the stupidity of the characters.  from the start I hated the MC.  He was passive again and again, allowing people to push him around.  He's supposedly 18, but often acted like a 6-7 year old with his whiny attitude and failure to just act.  His friend commits a major ""you'll get your hand chopped off"" crime and he just shouts at him and then stands near him while arguing over it.  And it kept going on like that.  he'd happily talk, but action seemed beyond him.<br /><br />This was a well-written book with horrible characters and a plot that I can't forgive for its illogical flow.  Sorry to the author to slam it, but its a 2 star at best.  Read at your own risk.  You may be able to get past the problems that struck me, but it will be frustrating to many.",2.0,0,2022

Suspense-filled from page one!,"Texas Buried Secrets<br />Cowboy Lawmen #6<br />By Virginia Vaughan<br /><br />This one keeps the killer a secret and it will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I don't watch scary movies, but I imagine many of the thrillers that are so popular would give one the same feeling as this did. I kept waiting for the killer to pop out at any opportunity and start terrorizing any and all in his proximity. The book is intense and yet not over the top. I will admit Josh needed a good shaking to make him wake up and realize what a muddle he was making of everything - hello you are in love but feel it would be unfair to burden someone else with your burdens. Duh - pretty sure that's what people who care about one another do.<br /><br />This is the final book in the Cowboy Lawmen series, but it can be read as a standalone book with just a few references that go back to the other books. I found it to be a good weekend read and an easy few hours to escape the scorching heat.<br /><br />I was provided a complimentary copy of this book with no expectations but that I provide my honest opinion - all thoughts expressed are my own.",4.0,1,2022

You know we belong to the land … ~ Oscar Hammerstein,"That simple gesture told him how invested she was in the produce of the land. His mind turned to all she stood to lose if her father died.<br /><br />Her feet are solidly planted on good Hertfordshire soil.<br /><br />Those sentences appear fairly late in this story, but for me, they sum up the point of the book.<br /><br />I freely admit to being a farmer’s daughter.  My early memories involve herding cows and packing lunch to take to Dad in the field. I walked through wheat fields nearly as tall as I was until I learned not to do that after the wheat began to head. I swam in the stock tank and walked to country school.  I related very strongly to Elizabeth’s efforts to save Longbourn as long as she possibly could — which of course, would be only as long as her father lived.<br /><br />By the end of the book, the chorus of “Oklahoma” ran through my mind.  It was still there the following morning.  It is time for it to leave now!<br /><br />The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts. ~ Margaret Mitchell<br /><br />When Mr. Bennet falls ill, the Bennets’ Uncle Phillips and their neighbors who might have been expected to offer support to the family choose a different path.  Uncle Phillips sides with the heir apparent.  Sir William Lucas gives no aid to the family.  Elizabeth Bennet takes on the responsibility of Longbourn.  Her Aunt Gardiner knows the Darcy family by reputation and suggests Elizabeth contact Mr. Darcy to ask for advice.  Since it is inappropriate for a woman to correspond with a man, she signs her missives as “E. R. Bennet” to conceal her identity.<br /><br />Never, in her wildest dreams, does she imagine that someday Mr. Darcy will accompany his friend to Meryton.<br /><br />Darcy arrives in Meryton hoping to meet the young E. R. Bennet.  At the Assembly, he learns the Bennets have five daughters and no sons.  Darcy does not deal well with deception.<br /><br />And yet, his sister hopes he will meet “the woman of his dreams” during the visit.<br /><br />A person does not grow from the ground like a vine or a tree, one is not part of a plot of land. Mankind has legs so it can wander. ~ Roman Payne<br /><br />The Bennets know they must relocate soon.  Can they trust the help offered by their new neighbors?<br /><br />Quote from the book:  “Papa, the man has been both arrogant and kind. In matters of society, I would ignore him for the rest of my life. In matters of the estate, I trust him implicitly. Aunt Gardiner was correct. He knows his business well.”<br /><br />In the midst of this chaos, our dear couple must find time to fall in love.<br /><br />But a more mature love must also be expressed.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  However, it was a small wooden box in the back of her husband’s closet that finally reconciled the mistress of Longbourn with how their lives were soon to change permanently. Inside were silly verses she had written to her husband after they were first married. She sobbed.<br />“Mr. Bennet has always loved the written word.”<br /><br />An abundance of JAFF stories feature the differences and unhappiness in the Bennet marriage.  For a welcome change, this is a story of Mrs. Bennet’s grief at Mr. Bennet’s death.  Mama Bennet and all the Bennet daughters mourn and accept.  I felt every fear and let loose a few tears. Beautifully written.<br /><br />The author gave me an early copy of this book without requiring a review.<br /><br />We come and go, but the land is always here.

"Is it that Life Imitates Fiction, or the Other Way Around?","Lowen Ashleigh was a writer whose career had been sidetracked while she was taking care of her cancer-ridden mother.  Just before her eviction for not paying her rent, her agent called her with a mysterious offer to become a co-author with a famous writer who has been injured in an auto accident.  There were three remaining books in a popular series that the author had outlined, but not completed.  Lowen wanted to decline, because she didn't want to be obligated for book tours, signings, and interviews. But the injured writer's legal team, including her husband, made a lucrative offer that Lowen could not refuse.<br /><br />Soon Lowen travelled from Manhattan to Vermont to discover that the writer was not just injured, but could not speak and was confined to her bed and a wheelchair.  The task fell on Lowen to find the outlines for the remaining books among the writer's extremely disorganized office.  While digging for the outlines  she discovered a totally different manuscript that was so shocking that it left Lowen in fear for everyone who lived in the household. This exciting novel by Colleen Hoover consists of two stories in one, as Lowen got way more than she bargained for.  The way Hoover switched from the current action to the place in the manuscript that Lowen was reading really added to the suspense. Whether this would be an attraction or a deterrent to readers, please be aware there is a lot of explicit sex and frequent use of the F word.",5.0,1,2022

"Not mature YA, or even remotely MA.  Very, very YA.","This is really 2.5 stars.  I went with the 2 instead of the 3 because I decided once into the 3rd book, that I wouldn't enjoy finishing it as much as I would enjoy moving onto a different read.<br /><br />It is quite the challenge to find adult fantasy novels, especially when you read as many books as I do in any given year...  This was advertised as older YA/MA, so I bought it.  I disagree with that categorization.<br /><br />So, here goes:<br />Pros:  Nice world building.  The decriptions of the island, towns, ect. are wonderful.  I can definitely see it while I'm reading it.  I can also visualize all of the creatures as well.  Nice job there.<br />Cons:  The characters, whether they are hundreds of years old, human adults, or teenagers, are essentially ALL teenagers.  The tears, the angst, the rage, the drama!  Another irritation was all of the Mr. referrences if the human in question is old enough to be a parent...  Did a teenager write this story?  Everyone seemed to be either quite evil or good, without those wonderful layers that make characters both real and come alive in a story.<br />So, sadly, this was not a book I enjoyed.",2.0,0,2022

A Powerful But Disjointed Read,"Nightcrawling is a rare showcase of one incredible talent; that Leila started writing this when she was only seventeen, and that she just turned nineteen now that it's published, is remarkable. Her writing style is indeed poetic and visceral, but also highly sensitive, empathetic, tender, and real.<br /><br />With all that being said, I just wish that the execution of Nightcrawling was better. When every word, sentence, paragraph, and page is packed full and brimming with literary richness, it's hard to figure out what is actually going on when the story gets swallowed up by the lyricism of it all. It's difficult to truly appreciate a beautiful turn of phrase, or a lush description, or an exquisite metaphor and simile when it's constantly there and coming at you non-stop and fast the whole time. By writing a book like this, nothing pops or stands out. It needed to be dialed down a notch. It was just too much; it very quickly became overwhelming and exhausting. This is where and why a really tight edit was necessary so that the book can be more readable, easier on the eyes, and digestible. That's not to say that the story wasn't easy to follow or understand, but you could tell that Leila's writing was treated a little too preciously which did more of a disservice than a benefit to the important story we have here.<br /><br />This novel also suffers from pretty awkward pacing issues because it can't decide if it wants to be plot-focused or character-driven. Not that it can't be both, the issue was how imbalanced it was. When the narrative focuses on the former, such as the moment when our main character Kiara stumbles into sex work by presumably a case of mistaken identity, I couldn't stop turning the page, but once it so heavily re-focuses on the latter, my interest waned, and I got bored until there was finally some action again, but by that point, the pacing slows to a laborious crawl. It took forever for the plot to start again just as how it took too long for the plot to begin in the first place. Kiara's head is a wondrous and heartbreaking place to be in, but to have us so deep in her every thought and emotion for such really long sections of time was distracting from a plot that is so interesting that we didn't really need to be in her head as much as we were. Again, with a tighter more streamlined edit, the book would have been more focused and less meandering, scattered, and rambling. So much of what Kiara shared with us about her memories and other people's backstories, while full of emotion for sure, wasn't relevant to the plot and was essentially fluff. Such gorgeous fluff, but still fluff nonetheless that desperately needed to be trimmed.<br /><br />Character development was also inconsistent and lacking description-wise. Trevor is described as a boy, yet a man, but is muscular, and yet tiny, but she's able to carry him, and he's nine years old? We don't even get a sense or feel of what Kiara herself looked like, nor ever really knew exactly what time period it is, and why time jumps around so much. I also never quite understood how so many people (such as her brother, Marcus) could mean the whole world to Kiara and yet it's one-sided and clearly not mutual when she's always saddled with having the world on her shoulders alone? I also thought it was confusing how Kiara was so loving, deep, and sweet in her mind, but she is never this way in person. She and the characters are always cursing, arguing, and coming at each other in one-word or one-sentence responses; to have this dialogue style happening in juxtaposition with her elaborate literary musings, it was jarring.<br /><br />Nightcrawling didn't suffer from being overwritten. It was under-edited.<br /><br />For better and for worse, the book has DEBUT all over it. As is typical of most debuts, it's way too long, too confident, too disjointed, and too all over the place. All its mistakes and flaws can be forgiven because while it's far from perfect, it's SO GOOD. It's not an easy read, but it's a vital one. It can be graphic, uncomfortable, and tragic, and it's pretty grim. It won't be a book for everyone because of its subject matter, especially one that's unfortunately based on a real-life event. The writing style can be an acquired taste, but it really does sparkle, you can't help but still admire it. Leila is quite a literary force, and I cannot wait to read her future works. I just hope that next time with undoubtedly many more books, her editing team won't be so precious, afraid, and reluctant to stringently edit her work. Leila is a gift who deserves to have her work polished and harnessed to its finest, and I'd also hope that she'll rise above the ""17-year-old gifted writer"" image and where instead her talent alone will speak for itself.",3.0,0,2022
That Cliffhanger...,"**3.5 STARS**<br /><br />Content Warning: Violence<br /><br />I have finally read the book and whew…it’s a long one at 805 pages. I love the cover, this series has good covers so far.<br /><br />Bryce and Hunt are solid in this sequel. There is no question about whether they are meant for each other, they are mates (I know SJM is all about fated mates). Nothing can come between them throughout this book and we see their relationship get to the next level. There are a bunch of spicy scenes between Bryce and Hunt with the signature mind and space altering sex that always happens in a SJM book. These two are ride or die, besties, lovers, partners forever and I’m glad about it but also I felt like okay now that we’ve established that, let’s move on in the story. 😅<br /><br />The world building is as intricate as ever. This urban fantasy has everything in it: angels, demons, fae, shifters, wolves, mer, humans and everything in between. So I am impressed as ever with how vivid this world is.<br /><br />The side characters have a big, big role in this book. I’m glad Ruhn had a chance to shine in this one. I think he was my favorite in the book. Ruhn is really trying to figure out who he is without his apart from his royal Fae status and I appreciated his struggle. Also, I was so into his growing relationship with the mysterious Agent Day – I was actually thinking it reminded me of like an online relationship 😆, it made me laugh a little when things got spicy! But I love Ruhn.<br /><br />There are so many characters who got a spotlight: Tharion (the mer), Ithan (the wolf), Cormac (Fae Prince), Sofie and then some. And then some!!! There are sooo many characters and honestly I thought it was too many at one time. Cormac was okay-not very interesting, Tharion is to be determined…we shall see where his story goes and Ithan is that younger brother type role. Honestly by the middle of the book I was wondering why Bryce always surrounded by guys in this one? Where was the female friends I loved from book one?! Why was Fury and Juniper barely in this book? I was bummed about that. One of the reasons why I loved the first book was Bryce and her girlfriends. It’s almost at the end of the book when she longs for a female friend and finds a new one in Hypaxia, Ruhn’s fiance.<br /><br />Speaking of fiance…this is a fated mates story which means…everyone is going to find a mate by the end of this series. 💯 That’s a lot of fated mates lol.<br /><br />The story unfolds like a mystery with Tharion, being the main detective and then he drags Bryce and Hunt into the search . And for something so secret – it ended up being a whole group knowing the secrets! There is a LOT going on in this story and at one point when a character referred to Hunt as Athalar, I was like, who’s Athalar?! LMAO 🤣. I was like did someone new come into the conversation? I was so genuinely confused…that’s when I had to take a break on reading. Can’t they all just call him Hunt? Like everyone else was being called by their names except Hunt/Athalar/Orion. I have a hard enough time keeping the Princes of Hel straight – where is the character name list? I need one.<br /><br />The beginning is good with Sofie and then it got slow and some parts was just boring. There was so much dialogue about mundane things at times. I was hoping for more urgency in finding this child with Thunderbird powers. That story fizzled out into something else…but that was the main engine of the story until Danika’s breadcrumbs started to lead them to something more sinister. I wanted more action, maybe less of everyone’s point of view. I could have done without the romance dramas of everyone involved, but I get that this is a romance heavy urban fantasy. The whole story was about finding information and making all the pieces fit into the puzzle. When there was action, it was good and there is a major twist at the ending. I’m still trying to decide how I feel about it…I was like 😳😱.<br /><br />I almost wish this was one of those series that gave each character a book because it seems like Ruhn deserves one, Tharion, Ithan, Ariadne too probably, and Hypaxia also. And I can’t forget the Hind and her backstory as well!<br /><br />I did not read this in one sitting like I do with SJM books, it took me about 3 or 4 days. The writing is easy so at least it is easily devoured but like I said…there is so much going on.<br /><br />Why you should read it:<br />*you are an SJM fan and already invested in the series<br />*Bryce and Hunt steamy scenes for those who were waiting for it lol<br />*some really good twists, especially the ending<br /><br />Why you might not want to read it:<br />*long and wish it had more action<br />*I think some characters need their own book to keep some of these installments shorter<br />you will either love or hate the ending<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I thought I would have read this in one day, even with the 800 page count but if I thought book one was a 4 star read, for me, this was a 3 star read but the ending bumped it up a little. But I wish it didn’t take 700 pages for me to be wowed by the book lol…the ending is a shocker for sure, and I will definitely read book three to see how that goes. I hope it goes beautifully but I also have my worries about it as well. Overall, a pretty good sequel with detailed world building as usual and characters I came to care about but there were spots that were little too slow for me. I loved that Ruhn had more of a spotlight and of course this will definitely make Bryce/Hunt fans super happy…well, for the most part. 🤭 Looking forward to book three…hopefully we don’t have too long.",4.0,1,2022

I just couldn't do it.  Soo soo annoying,"I know this was supposed to be a to cute, sweet romance, but I found it so annoying from the beginning.<br />Not sure you can do a spoiler alert on this type of books, but I will any how because... *** SPOILER ALERT ***<br /><br />From the start, the Christmas cliche references were just to much and over the top.  From the FMC being Named Avalance Snow, to her best friend being named Rudolf, to her sisters Noell and whatever the other one was... then to name the MMC Garland.<br /><br />Every pages was filled with references, such as instead of a curse word.. it was Sugar Cookies... or some other corny reference to a the holiday... Holy Jingle Bells... or reigndeer poop.  It just went on and on and on.<br /><br />I think maybe this was something a Christian Romance person might enjoy.  It was 77% into it and they have not even kissed, so I honestly can't say how any intimate scenes with them went, but at the rate of keeping my sanity, I didn't want to get into that part so I put the book down.  Any reference to his Jingle Balls.. or possibly her yelling out fa la la la during the throws of passion would have made me puke.<br /><br />Also I don't get how this classifies as a grumpy romance as the MMC was not grumpy at all. He was kind, caring, loves kids, does all kinds of charity work... there was 0 grumpy about him.<br /><br />Now, her on the other hand, she was kind of mean and rude, especially since he wouldn't sell.  He teases her about her name and she goes on a twenty minute yelling spree about he cancerous mother, how great her parents are.. how they love the holiday.  Seriously, chill out, he was joking.  Maybe you are tired of people making fun of your name, but you are named Avalanche.. one of the dumbest things I heard.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? not ever.<br />I mean some will say it is sweet and such, but I just found it way way over the top with all the Christmas cliche references that it made me want to vomit.",1.0,0,2022

A Twisting Roller Coaster of Time Travel,"Riddle takes us on a twisting roller coaster of time travel. Like a detective story, the book begins with a murder and a wrongly accused suspect. In the near future, they do not send murderers and other bad guys to a prison island as they did in the past. They send them back in time, and we mean way back in time, to the time dinosaurs ruled the earth.<br /><br />The first chapters of the book alternate between our wrongly accused hero in prehistoric times and the daughter’s attempts to bring her father back to the world today. Then, the daughter must time travel, although unwillingly, to the near past. This is when the book becomes a mind twister. We have an endless loop repeating itself in time. No reader can see what’s coming.<br /><br />Lost in Time provides a target for those with such a bent to shoot holes in Riddle’s logic, and there are many opportunities to do so.

Great baking book for beginners and intermediates,"I was happy to see that BB had metric measurements as the primary measure with Freedom (US) measurements offered in parentheses; it gave me further confidence in the book.<br /><br />Professionals, and serious home cooks & bakers choose to use these measurements because they are more accurate, there is little room for error (human or technical), and it’s a universal form of measurement that nearly anyone, anywhere, can use if they have a reliable scale.<br /><br />I just found Bettie on YouTube, and even though I’ve been cooking and baking for a while, I really enjoy her videos and learn from her, especially with bread, I’m newer to sourdough bread baking specifically.<br /><br />This book is a great choice for a novice baker looking for the knowledge basics and recipes, or, anyone looking to get a bit more comfortable with intermediate skills, kitchen vocabulary, tried and true master recipes, and creating their own add-ins & recipes using her formula.<br /><br />The first thing I look for when checking out a cookbook, is if the ingredient measurements are in metric or imperial  (U.S cups). I know in the US there are still a lot of hold outs that don’t like the idea of using a scale for metric measurements, however, weighing our ingredients is more accurate, and a good scale will cost you between $15-35 +/- here on Amazon (my Escali lightweight scale (linked below) was $15 when I bought it). The price fluctuates on Amazon.<br /><br />Having a reliable, digital kitchen scale opens up a whole world of recipes for a cook or baker. No need to worry if the ingredient was packed, or what “swoop and scoop” technique was used by the author- it’s metric, just weigh ingredients using a small container on the scale.

It’s worth a look, if you don’t like it, you can always return the kindle edition w/in 7 days of purchase by going to “settings” in your kindle library app, or via “digital purchases” in your “orders” here on the main website- but I think you’ll like having this as a baking reference..",5.0,1,2022
Pints & Potions - read 8 chapters and stopped - for many reasons,"This book had so much I didn't like. Right away in the first pages I could see where the book was going. I'm sure women everywhere compare their sexy underwear and watching sex videos with their friends of their friends' spouses.  All the supposedly funny/sexy dialogue was just lame and immature. So she gives up on men and the first man she sees she is totally captivated. I was annoyed at the man who kept saying ""darlin'"" over and over, or "" my love:"" or ""kiss me"".  They are on a walk, so he carries her around so he can feel her against him. the rock fight was toooo silly. At one point, he called her ""a wet dream"". So, obviously this author is not for me. Nothing in this book worked for me. I bought because of the reviews. Glad I didn't buy any more.",1.0,0,2022
Sappy and Obsessive,"I was disappointed in what I expected to be a light story set in a wonderful Italian atmosphere. Sadly it wasn't another Under the Tuscan Sun. Katy's extreme obsession with her mother's memory is just weird -- she's an adult! The plot is familiar -- woman unhappy at home runs off to a foreign paradise, has passionate experience, and maybe or maybe not returns home. The mythical time warp device wasn't done well -- Jodi Picoult does it better in her latest novel. Finally, I was disappointed in some of the descriptions of Italian culture. Katy's passionate food experiences were just gluttonous, and the voices of the Italian characters didn't seem authentic. (Not to mention a couple of minor Italian grammatical errors.) I felt that the author had researched some facts about Positano, but hadn't truly experienced the culture. To sum up, there are other novels out there for an enjoyable reading trip through Italy.",2.0,0,2022
Loved this Memoir,It was like sitting with a friend over coffee (or wine) chatting about life. So much I didn't know.  And a good peek into how we all grownup different. But some experiences are the same.  I have totally been in a relationship like hers and Matthew.  I love the Dirty Dancing portion.  You can see the passion she has for her work through each sentence.  And personal growth (we all go through).  Kudos on DWTS work...and all your recovery.  I highly recommend reading this book.  And Madonna? And everyone you have worked with...incredible.  I learned so much.,5.0,1,2022
Good book,"The characters are great, well defined, and believable. The storyline is so good it should be made into a movie.<br />My only complaint, and this is just me, is the pages and pages of lovey stuff about the character Billi. Ok, she was cute and smart but the go on and on about how ""adorable"" she was is just too much. It wasn't the romantic involvement , I expected that (and no it's not really a romance story). I felt it got a little mushy. But then I'm old and things like that get to me.<br />Still a great book and worth reading.",4.0,1,2022
3.5 rating,"While this is an okay bread machine book, if I had to chose I would go with the book -Bread Machine by Michelle Anderson as that book has simple recipes with known healthy ingredients.

M. Anderson's book has ingredients you most likely have on hand.",3.0,0,2022
I’m definitely not sure about the title. Ignore the title and love the book.,"This is a story about first love, young love, older love,  sacrificial love, renewed love and acknowledged love.<br />Then betrayal love if that exists.<br />And I may have to edit my review later.<br />The story starts with the heroine Morgan at age 16-17 then jumps 16 years to continue the story. The Hero Jonah is actually a hero (read the story to see how and why) and his story starts when Morgan’s does and continues when hers does just in a totally different way.<br />Then there is Clara, Morgan’s 16 year old daughter that acts very mature until her age catches up with her and she makes 16 year old decisions.<br />Morgan and Jonah are put into an impossible position and Clara being drawn into this position without knowing anything and this is the story of the three of them finding ways to survive and move forward.<br />A lot of the story is ugly a lot like life. One thing for sure that hopefully Morgan, Jonah and Clara finally realizes (although never made clear in the book) is that there is always more to the story.<br />I do definitely recommend that anyone read this story and if you think it isn’t moving fast enough keep reading because you are behind.<br />Colleen Hoover is a great author, however she only has a few books available on Kindle Unlimited. This one was KU. The rest you will have to purchase and I know I will buy some of her books.<br />The one thing I didn’t care for was chapters bouncing between Morgan and Clara. There has to be a better way of telling the story. Just my opinion. And probably wrong.<br />Anyway please read and enjoy this book. I did.",4.0,1,2022
Why no research?,"There is no doubt the writing in Reminders of Him is beautiful. The romance is lovely. The ending is wrapped up in a perfect happy (albeit rather rushed) bow following lots of heartbreak and sadness and hope along the way. The way Ledger was so conflicted between whether he should hate or love Kenna and if he was betraying people he cared about by falling in love with her was written so incredibly well. I probably would’ve given this book 5 stars if I didn’t have experience with foster care, that’s how good it is. The thing is, I feel like the author did absolutely no research. The story would’ve been very different if she had. The way parental rights termination happened wasn’t accurate. The fact it wasn’t a CPS case even though she gave birth in jail was all wrong. Because her mother’s rights were terminated and the father was dead, Diem was technically parentless (meaning she would’ve been a ward of the state) so it seemed odd the grandparents hadn’t adopted her yet. A big deal was made about how her rights were terminated because her sentence was so incredibly long. She served 5 years and since she was in jail when the child was born, she got out when the kid was still just 4. That’s not an incredibly long sentence or a long time for the child to remain in kindship care with her grandparents, without rights being terminated, and have regular visitation with her mother. The way the nearly 5-year-old Diem accepted her biological mother without hesitation and seemed to attach to her super easily and instantly was meant to be heartwarming but instead just threw up all the red flags in my mind wondering if she had RAD (reactive attachment disorder) and at the very least disordered attachment (even though no other relationships in her life indicated she did). I spent so much time while reading it being annoyed by how wrong she got foster care, I just didn’t feel the intense feelings other readers talk about. I recommend the book to adults who enjoy emotional stories with lots of romance, but you might want to skip it if you have experience with foster care or you may just end up more annoyed than anything else.",3.0,0,2022
Easy Reading at Best,"This boxed set was, at best, average reading. The simplicity of the plots did increase to bafflingly mixes. The beginning plots are so easily solved that there are no bread crumbs to follow, just whole loaves of bread thrown at the reader. As this series evolves, the loaves of bread turn into such a complex of bread, cookie, and every other crummy pastry imaginable all mixed together, repeated endlessly, and left me totally half-baked as far as trying to figure out the end results.<br /><br />The beginning of these books are so horribly punctuated that I cringed through the missed and misused commas. Not to mention other punctuation errors. As the books evolved, the punctuation did improve vastly. But still they needed more skillful proofing. At least I could give the author kudos for trying.<br /><br />The writing style is very simplistic throughout. Two middle-aged women start a B&B in a historical house on oceanfront property. The characters are okay, but I would have better descriptive characterizations. Also, a growth of these characters would could been better as the series continued.<br /><br />My most problem was all the little subplots that were left unresolved. Such as the son's problem with his loan shark. There were too many little question marks left in my mind to feel the single books were actually completed.<br /><br />Another problem was the time frames. I never knew if an hour, a day, or a week had passed. It got confusing too often.<br /><br />If an author is going to write about a topic, at least correct terminology should be researched and used. It was clear this author had never been on a boat, much less in a stormy sea. Description was extremely poorly done. (Boats of this size don't have windows...)<br /><br />This boxed set is probably most appropriate for readers who like very simple ""who done its.""  But there are just too many areas that either these two amateurs should have recognized and explored or, at least, have had the police explore.",3.0,0,2022
Questionable for RB Parker's legacy...wokeness-political-correctness-Leftish-agenda,"Et tu, Brut? ""Bye Bye Baby"" is a tone-deaf disconnect. With this, AA has introduced politics, and the Left's mindset into Spencer's milieux. Big-time, as the Millennials say.  Euphemistically speaking, this wokeness-political-correctness-Leftish-agenda is inappropriate for RB Parker's legacy. When Parker's estate blessed Atkins a decade ago, I suspect that he hadn't yet espoused the Left's agenda, which shall we say, would not complement Spencer's persona: skilled, rugged individualist, highly-literate (Spenser the Elizabethan & ROYALIST & traditionalist poet - get it?) and, un-entitled attitude, etc - all attributes which the Left despises.",1.0,0,2022
Terrible waste of my time,"Ugh the ""hero"" was a real jerk from the very first meeting and the second and the third and yes he improved but he never apologized for anything he did or said. The ""hero"" is being stupid about an important issue nanny tries ONE TIME to change (in the lamest least likely to convince way humanly possible I might as well ad) his mind then gives up and conspired with someone he had issues with to go around the dad and do (something that could kill the kid not very likely but still very possible) it anyways. No real resolution to that. So you come to the moment where there needs to be a seemingly final break in there relationship so that they can get past the heros hangup and get the happy ending. And he is brutal to her I mean if I was her between the trauma that happened and his reaction to it I would be feeling VERY suicidal. Frankly he was right and she was wrong but still there are somethings that should never be said to another person especially because they are true. And no apology EVER from him. Oh he said he ought to apologize then he said he loved her and she just melted at his feet and literally said ""best apology ever""🤢🤢🤢🤢 this couple is ... dysfunctional and should not be together maybe after a few years of counseling and or therapy for both of them then we could see maybe they could be together then... probably not real change is hard at least it is in real life and the fact that these and so many other important issues were just swept under the rug to be forgotten and ignored made me hit the 4th wall way to hard to e er enjoy.

Laugh-Out-Loud Cloak and Dagger Thriller,"Richard Osman's third installment in the Thursday Murder Club Series is a hoot. Although the book would be excellent as a standalone, I recommend readers finish the preceding two books first. That will provide a better introduction to the four main characters who live in a retirement village where they revisit their former occupations (spy, nurse, union leader, psychiatrist) as they unite in the Thursday Murder Club to solve cold cases.<br /><br />It stretches the limits of imagination to read what these septuagenarians can do, but that's what makes it so funny, along with a heavy dose of Richard Osman's humor. This time, the murder club chooses to study an old case in which a woman is killed when her car careens off a cliff, but her body was never discovered.  Was it an accident, suicide, murder, faked death?  Meanwhile, Elizabeth, the former British spy, is ordered by a character nicknamed the Viking (a money launderer) to kill a former KGB agent or else the Viking will kill her best friend Joyce (the nurse). Those two plot lines drive the rest of the action, but more murders occur, new alliances are formed, and romance is budding all around.  While Osman provides a satisfying conclusion, I hope he is planning another sequel.  I see great potential for the next story involving an evil criminal who is behind bars and just waiting to get out to seek revenge against a member of the Thursday Murder Club who is responsible for putting her there.  Treat yourself to all three of these entertaining novels!",5.0,1,2022
What historical fiction should be,"Oh, this is what historical fiction should be!  I was so engaged with this book, it was hard to set it aside.  So often, multiple timelines don’t work for me, as one is often so much stronger than the others.  But Brooks is smart to use the present day to weave in scientific and historical facts we wouldn't otherwise understand while also showing the continuing prevalence of racism, even among the supposedly open minded.  She also created a storyline that was just as engrossing as the historical one.<br />The book starts in the present day with Theo, a black art historian and journalist, collecting an old picture of a horse from a pile of trash.  Meanwhile, Jess, a scientist for the Smithsonian, undertakes the study of an equine skeleton from the 19th Century.  Soon, their paths intersect.<br />But it is the story from the mid-19th Century that grabbed me the most.  Jarret is the son of a freedman, but is a slave himself.  His father is a well known trainer in Kentucky and Jarret has horses in the blood.  He bonds with a foal and helps train him to become an amazing racehorse and later, stud.  Young man and horse are both sold several times.  Brook perfectly captures the time and place.  The story unspools easily and it’s like watching a movie.  In a truth-is-stranger than fiction segment, a portrait of horse and groom ends up in the hands of Martha Jackson, an abstract art dealer, who was friends with Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollack, and who later donates it to the Smithsonian.<br />I found myself bonding with each and every main character in the story. Even the animals have personalities that shine through.  It made me feel alternatively sad and angry.  Even the happy occasions are tinged with a hint of sadness.  I applaud Brooks for weaving together art, science, history and turning it into an fascinating story of a major part of US history.<br />This ranks among my favorites of the year.<br />I listened to this and the cast of characters were uniformly excellent.",5.0,1,2022
romance,"If you like a Hallmark-esque-plot, fluff romance that is predictable and not a lot of angst but don't enjoy the Hallmark movie squeaky clean sweetness, this could be a good book choice for you. Unfortunately, I was looking for the squeaky clean sweetness variety and this isn't really that.<br /><br />The characters were okay but didn't make me fall in love with them. And while Heather was the formulaic plot villain and not a main character, I would have liked to have seen the legal repercussions for her. I realize that there are many who will love this book but it really wasn't for me.<br /><br />Best line happened when best friend Dean brings Suzie home for Christmas and his mom is astounded.

Riding in Her Mother's Footsteps,"I very much enjoyed reading ""The Book Woman's Daughter,"" by Kim Michele Richardson, but I have a few suggestions for other readers considering this book.  First and foremost, you MUST read Richardson's other book, ""The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek,"" first.  Although other reviewers have called this a standalone book, I did not find enough backstory woven into the plot to deem this book a true standalone.  Had I not read the first book, I might not have been able to follow the storyline to enable me to enjoy this one as much as I did.  Another suggestion would be (especially if you haven't read the first book) to Google ""Kentucky Blue People,"" and ""The Packhorse Librarian Project.""<br /><br />This book picks up 15 years after the first book ended. The book woman's daughter's name is Honey, and she is in a world of trouble, as her parents are jailed for miscegenation (a blue married to a non-blue) and Honey could be assigned to a state institution at her age of 16 with no guardian.  Luckily, a guardian is found, but she passes away, leaving Honey to hide from social services and the sheriff. The most uplifting part of the book occurs when the Packhorse Librarian Project from the 1930s and 1940s is revived by a local library.  Honey gets the job, and with her mother's trusty mule Junia, recreates her mother's old route, delivering books in the remote hollers of Eastern Kentucky.<br /><br />Richardson fills the book with entertaining characters. My favorites were Pearl, a young woman who is new to the area as a lookout in the National Forest Service and Mr. Morgan, Honey's lawyer.  There are many candidates for the worst characters, but Perry Gillis leads the pack, along with his relatives, a social services worker, and the sheriff. The book offers themes around poverty, illiteracy, domestic violence, harassment, racial prejudice, women's rights, and resilience.  It's not as good as the first book, which in all fairness is one of my all-time favorites, but it is a very worthwhile read.",4.0,1,2022
My heart is full,"I was never a Valerie fan.Main reason being she married my first love, Eddie VanHalen. lol! Funny but a true story. I fell in love with his picture on the back of the Women and children first album (I was 9 years old) and from then on he was my man. As an adult I never paid attention to Valerie's career. Until she showed up on Kid's Baking Championship and I thought, "" She seems like such a nice person. "" From what one can tell by watching Kid's Baking Championship.I debated about reading this. The only reason I decided to was my sister was going to. Then while waiting for my name to reach the top of the library’s waitlist, I read an extract taken from this book in People magazine that left me breathless and nearly brought me to tears. I knew reading it was the right decision. Valerie loved Eddie. Truly loved him, so very much and he loved her in return. ""Soulmates"" as she says in the book. She speaks of the end of Eddie's life. How they ( her and their son,Wolfgang) were there and showered him with love and him them, right up till the end and beyond. Eddie's last words to them and them to him were, "" I love you."" I can relate to all this having gone through it with my Dad. It's something to cherish. Which after reading on they do and always will. ( Wolfie even writing a song and putting together a video to honor his Dad.) This book made me love her for loving him. I was so glad he had that in his life. Glad she had it hers. (Everyone should.) I'm sure I' m not going to get those intimate details in his life story that someone else has written. This is Valerie's story. It was deep and heartfelt. From her soul and I felt it. I felt emotional while reading. My heart was full as were my eyes, with tears. The book wasn't about just that, of course. It was about her learning to love herself for who she was in the hear and now. As she was then and is now at the present time. Without comparing herself to the number on the scale. Being grateful , happy and counting her blessings. There were also recipes scattered throughout. All and all it was good,true to life (relatable), raw with emotion and extremely touching. Keep up the good work,Valerie. Your son isn't the only rockstar in the family.",5.0,1,2022
The Boy Who Lost Everything,"""Dear Edward,"" by Ann Napolitano, is the poignant story of a 12-year-old boy who became the only survivor of a plane crash.  Napolitano got the idea for her novel from two actual plane crashes, but this book is entirely fiction.  The chapters alternated in time from the present (after the crash) to the past (time on the flight). Knowing in advance that the people would perish made a difference to me as I read. I tried not to get attached to the characters, but Napolitano made it hard not to embrace their diverse and unique characteristics. I felt a sense of dread and pathos as I witnessed their last moments.<br /><br />Edward's life after the crash is a tough read.  He lost both parents and an older brother that he idolized. He went to live with an aunt and uncle, but even that family connection was not enough to compensate for his devastating losses. Mentally and emotionally, he struggled.  His aunt and uncle had tried unsuccessfully to have a baby, but a series of miscarriages extinguished their hopes. The only room they had available for Edward on such short notice was furnished as a nursery, which left him recoiling in horror.  He never occupied that room, spending each night at the home of a neighbor, where he was allowed to sleep on the floor of the room of a girl named Shay, who was also 12.  This arrangement went on for years until high school, which I found to be improbable, but which all the adults condoned because Shay had become Edward's lifeline.<br /><br />Edward was a reluctant celebrity, having been identified as the sole survivor of a major plane crash.  Not only did this unwelcomed attention come to him at school, but he also became the unknowing recipient of hundreds of letters from the relatives of people who died on the plane, usually asking if he remembered seeing them or if he would carry out some aspiration that the deceased person had. Edward's uncle hid these letters in a garage, but Edward stumbled upon them and secretly shared them with his best friend Shay.  The plot from that point is driven by what Edward decided to do about the letters. Edward enjoyed an unusual amount of freedom, as his aunt and uncle granted him a great deal of latitude, perhaps too much. The story took him through high school graduation and gave a glimpse into how he might decide to spend his future, along with a fortune of insurance money and donations that came his way.  While the book is the story of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, it left me with a hollow feeling that Edward would never fully recover from the loss of his family.",4.0,1,2022

Would make a great book club selection,"I have very firm ideas about what encompasses a good historical fiction story.  Luckily, this book manages to check off most of my demands. I want to learn about someone or something I was previously unaware of.  Check.  Belle La Costa Greene rose to a position of prominence in the art world when women were barely allowed to be anything but teachers, secretaries or shop girls.  And she did it with minimal formal education and while passing as a white woman.  I want the book to provide an in depth look at the time and place.  Check. The book does a fabulous job of fleshing out the politics, business and society that Belle dealt with.  And I want a story that totally engages me.  Check.<br />I also really appreciated the portions of the book spent on outlining Belle’s parents and their diverse views on equality.<br />At the end, there were still questions I wish the authors had answered in their Notes.  When did it “come out” that Belle was actually black?  In a society as closed as The Four Hundred, how was Belle so easily accepted?<br />This is a book club selection and I highly recommend it for other book clubs looking for a strong discussion.",5.0,1,2022

Thirty More Reasons to Love This Author,"As an public school educator, you gotta love it when an author reaches beyond her circle to pour out so much truth about how our kids are lost in a system meant to keep them down. There are so many lessons that grabs your attention and it definitely makes you reflect.<br /><br />This Series is not one to be rushed! Rae writes every single word that's necessary to convey this story! Andre aka Dre has so much on his shoulders, but he handles it all so gracefully. Love, parenthood, co-parenting, friendship, and a world that chooses to constantly judge him for what they believe is the truth. He sacrifices himself for reasons that's admirable. Through it all, he manges to ensure his baby girl won't be subjected to the struggles he experienced.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended read that Rae poured her heart into!

Definitely not like her earlier works,"I've noticed that, while her writing style is as great as always, Ms. Vale's books, themselves, have become a bit boring. Absolutely nothing happens in this book. We have two characters who are ""frienemies"" since they were kids, for absolutely no stated reason, except that they were attracted to each other. Makes absolutely zero sense. Then, on top of that, the FMC is in her 30s but is a virgin and the MMC is, of course, NOT. How likely is that?! If she's not asexual, I highly doubt any well-adjusted, attractive woman is a virgin in her 30s! What is this? An 80s horror movie where the FMC must be a virgin to survive?! I have no problem with a virgin MC but it needs to be believable. And I find it highly unsatisfying when two characters are connected for years and one remains a virgin while the other goes on to have relationships. It kinda grosses me out. Like one couldn't be attracted to anyone else but the other didn't have that issue. It should be both or neither, IMO. I know that's not realistic ,but neither is a virgin in her 30s when there's absolutely no reason she's still a virgin.<br /><br />This book is about these two characters snarking at each other and him going on a few dates with other women before they magically just admit the attraction between them after more than 20 years of ""frienemies"". That's, literally, it.<br /><br />So, while the price of Ms. Vales books is going up, the quality is going down. I'm giving this a three star because the writing style is still great and the characters are still interesting on their own. It's the plot, heat, and believability that has become lacking in recent books. I hope this is something she can fix in the future, especially since we are now paying more per book.<br /><br />1 star - Awful!

Reluctant Love at First Sight,"Purity Mayfield is an orphan, having lost her parents in a fire when she was a toddler. She grew up in Haven House and Academy for the Enrichment of Young Women, maintaining close relationships with the women in this series after they've made their way into the world. She is a governess to three children of an aristocratic couple, who really don't want to be bothered by their children and rarely spend time with them. When the entire family is invited to a house party, she goes, too.<br /><br />She was taking a break in the garden while the parents and children are away for an afternoon, when she heard another child weeping nearby and overheard that child's governess berating her, threatening her, and pretty much telling her what a little shrew she is. Purity is enraged and when she finds the little girl, sees a hand print on her cheek. Furious, she sets out to find the little girl's father to have a word with him, especially when she finds out this governess is set to be this little girl's new mama and after she comes her new mama, the child is slated to go to boarding school.<br /><br />Theran Rutledge was a dreamboat of a man. Tall, dark, and handsome, of course, but he is a single father who had loved his late wife and was devoted to their daughter. Her happiness meant everything to him. When he finds out that the governess, who was really his stepsister-in-law and had her sights on marrying him, mistreated Bernadine, his daughter, he's beyond angry and pretty much kills the messenger who happened to be Miss Purity Mayfield.<br /><br />Purity is nothing more than a lowly servant and knew that speaking to Mr. Rutledge on the matter was risky, but her conscience wouldn't let her not say anything to him. She loved children and hated to see them mistreated in any way.<br /><br />This was a sweet love-at-first sight trope, even though neither Purity or Theran wanted to admit it. Theran was broken after the death of his wife and never thought he'd ever find love again and was happy enough showering Bernadine with love and affection, unlike other men of the ton who hardly knew their children. As long as she was happy, he was happy. But when Bernadine said she wanted Purity to be her new mama, he had to reign it all in. There was no way that was going to happen.<br /><br />This story has some good feels to it, a child I actually liked (I don't often like children in books because they're usually written as ill-mannered brats. Not the case here), a wicked antagonist that I wanted to slap myself, and a happily ever after that both Theran and Purity deserved.<br /><br />This book is part of a series, but can easily be read as a stand-alone novel.<br /><br />*I received a free copy of this book and voluntarily left a review.",5.0,1,2022
"just ok, main character and plot issues","Rating: 2.5<br /><br />It’s always the second book that seals the deal one way or the other. In this case , it the flag that tells me go no further.<br /><br />I like Alice Winters. Her books are normally characterized by such great elements like well-developed complicated plots, multi dimensional characters with great chemistry , and snappy intelligent dialogue.<br /><br />None of which is on display here.<br /><br />Based on the two books I’ve finished, the series reads like something scribbled off while completing other  high priority books.  The storylines are plodding.  The culprits spotted easily and immediately.  And any supposed mystery is so far from some being a surprise that it’s less a revelation, more a eye roll.<br /><br />But the real issue lies with the main characters.<br /><br />I had an issue with Hiro in the first story but thought that his lack of communication with his partner and friends had been worked through.<br /><br />No.  Hiro is, apparently, what I term a TSTC character.  That’s a To Stupid To Communicate character.  A type that’s right up there with the TSTL characters, often they are the same .<br /><br />Aspects of their personality include a inability to tell anyone around them major plot points that they need to know, often to survive, even though every rational person would do so immediately.<br /><br />Especially the person closest to them, which proceeds to put that person (and others) at the greatest risk. Duh.<br /><br />Other elements include running into danger ; for example when you suspect a person , someone who has been acting VERY differently ( like pulling a gun on you) , then asks you to get in the car. You know things like that.  Then… not telling or communicating that to anyone!<br /><br />Yep. TSTC.  That’s Hiro.  For the entire book.<br /><br />What does poor Maddox do? Spend the book angry and chasing after him. Plus wondering where he is, because, you know, no communication.<br /><br />Even the ghosts are irritated with him.<br /><br />I get that.<br /><br />At the end, with a miserable sort of pulled together finish to their case which gives no one any satisfaction, the author tries to offer up a hint of a mystery about the final days of a major character. But , to show you how bad this series is, you can already guess the answer and who exactly the bad guys are.<br /><br />Before that third book is even out!  Because everything here is one dimensional, even the mysteries.  Nancy Drew would have passed on this one as being too easy.<br /><br />So if you’re like me and you like this author, I’m not recommending this book or series.  There are , imo, far superior series and novels in her library.<br /><br />Instead head over to her Hitman’s Guide or the fantastic VRC: Vampire Related Crimes series.  Her character , Finn, a double amputee, is as engaging and complex as they come.<br /><br />Medium Trouble series:<br />- [x] Ghost of Lies #1<br />- [x] Ghost of Truth #2",2.0,0,2022
Is great story line not well put together.,The premise of this book was great. The way it was put together especially the 1st 3/4 of the book was terrible. Was terrible.. It was like the people were just put in places without any thought or care to their character their history their emotions or even or even what they were supposed to be doing. There were abrupt changes that made little sense  Or made it confusing.. This could have been a tremendous story if it had been written better.. The last 20 to 30 minutes of the book redeemed itself somewhat but did not make up for the horrible 1st 3/4 of the book.  It was very disappointing.,2.0,0,2022
Read a copy from the library. Glad I didn't spend money on it.,"I can sum up just how ridiculous the ""Chicago Statements"" are very easily:<br />If your denomination uses a Bible that has 66 Books and includes Acts 8:37, the ICBI Chicago Statement says that your Bible is the complete, infallible Word of God.<br />If your denomination uses a Bible that has 66 Books but leaves out Acts 8:37, the ICBI Chicago Statement says that your Bible is the complete, infallible Word of God.<br />If your denomination uses a Bible that has 80 Books, the ICBI Chicago Statement says that your Bible is the complete, infallible Word of God.<br /><br />According to the ICBI, WHATEVER YOUR DENOMINATION APPROVES is a complete and infallible Word of God.<br />Sorry, but just those three examples I gave (KJV, ESV, Wycliff) cannot all be perfect, complete, and infallible.

More Than One Affair in the Family,"When Anna McNichol's husband dies suddenly while on a whitewater rafting trip, wheels are set in motion to divulge long-kept secrets with significant implications for Anna and her three children. The drama begins to unfold when Mr. McNichols' will reveals that he has left a tenth of his estate to an undisclosed person or charity. Anna makes it her business to find out who or what this might be. I enjoyed the other major characters in the book, including Anna's surprising new love interest,  and her three adult children who are oh-so-different.  Her oldest daughter has serious relationship issues, brought on by her  overly needy behavior. The son was his father's favorite and is fiercely devoted to his father's memory. He struggles with commitment. The other daughter is on the autism spectrum, but functions relatively well most of the time, ironically having more stable relationships than the other two siblings.  Anna's mother is in a nursing home where she needs to enter the memory care center.  In her confusion, she makes some random comments that send Anna searching for not only one, but two mysterious persons. The loves and lives of the characters are what make ""A Family Affair"" by Robyn Carr a pleasure to read.",4.0,1,2022

Redundant,"I wish I could rate this higher, as I love a good elf romance, and this one has the good bones of a great story; but the redundancies and continuity errors ended up pulling the star rating down. Which I hate to do to an Indie author. An author that needs her editor to be more than grammar police, despite the editor making error there too. The author needs people around her to push her to the next level of her craft.  If this book had gone through some developmental edits it could be a five star read. As the author wrote a solid story but she seemed to rush through event to get to the next, so nothing in this book felt than anything was dire. The author never let tension or angst build, resolutions were to quick. Then there was the ‘I love you’ declaration; then several chapters later no one knows how the other feels. HUH??? Plus she gives the plots of her upcoming books away? I could go on, but most authors don’t want to listen to critiques of their babies; but know if you’re picking this book up you’ll be hit over the head with redundant feelings and even dialogue. Despite the redundancies, the author wrote an imaginative world and I am hoping book two is more polished. Yes I will be reading this author again, and hoping she grows into her craft.",3.0,0,2022
the most absurdly bad ending of any book I’ve ever read,"This thing is like the scooby doo cartoon except “the gang” is all female and all girl power, the mystery they solve is literally just a q-anon conspiracy theory that is as believable as flat earth, the male villains are complete caricatures down to being primarily motivated by misogyny. I mean if you want to mindlessly root for women sticking it to the man, or if you believe cell phone towers are taking over your brain, or even if you really loved the way scooby-doo plots had literal notes in the ground that said “clue” on them then and everything abruptly gets wrapped up at the end of an episode then this might be for you. Anyone else put the book down and walk away. Early on this book seemed like it had some potential, but I promise you if you read to the end you will regret it.

I really wanted to like this book.,"I really wanted to like this book, as it makes some very good points, however, it seems to put the person in the frame of mind that they can sell anything they want as long as they make it a new category. Some products / markets are simply monopolistically competitive, meaning that they are all deep down the same but try to claim they are all radically different. This is the case for the sushiritto and the Hydrafacial which are lauded in the same breath as Amazon, Google, and Tesla. I'd wished that the authors were more self-aware about this as it is very very difficult to really create a new category on its own; it's not something you can brainstorm up by following the authors' guidelines. The authors claim to be in their own 'category' of 'category defining' advice, but it is in fact a monopolistically competitive market of startup/marketing advice. Claiming the 'market' is irrelevant is baloney and betrays a lack of fundamental understanding of economics.",3.0,0,2022

Another fabulous book by Emily Giffin - don't miss it!,"Joe Kingsley III is the descendant of American royalty and was raised with the motto of ""to whom much is given, much is required.  But Joe has a bit of trouble following that and he flounders a bit under the expectations of a nation.  Meanwhile, Cate had a troubled childhood and escaped as soon as an opportunity presented itself - modeling.  When Joe and Cate have a chance meeting, there is no denying the spark.  But can two people from such different worlds make their love last?<br /><br />This book is a fictionalized account of JFK Jr., and his wife Carolyn and what might have happened to their love story.  In Giffin's very capable hands, you will fall into this romance tale and not want to emerge until the end.  I loved the characters - a great cast of supporting ones as well!  This book made you think about how we treat celebrities and what it really does to them - maybe especially those that are born into their celebrity and the expectations they must live under.  It's also a story of how our past defines us and our future.

A sad story with a happy ending,"It is often remarked that if a license were required for parenthood, many people would spend their lives childless. Unfortunately, anyone can become a parent. Certain people abuse this privilege outrageously. Thurston Crow was one of those people. He and his wife Thelma Lou had four kids. Thelma Lou came from a traumatic childhood. So did Thurston. Those childhoods bent and warped these two people, who reacted in different ways. Thelma was perpetually frightened, and gradually became detached from reality. She was always intimidated by Thurston. Thurston grew up to become limitlessly angry and violent. The book opens with him taking his older son David for a ride in the car in the Arizona desert in the 1950s. He slams on the brakes, sending the child crashing into the dashboard. He makes sudden turns, throwing the boy onto the floor, all the while telling him that he should be tough and never trust anyone... and also that three-year-old David is the only one he can trust to help him get rid of Thelma Lou.<br /><br /> Thurston not only coerces David and his three siblings to help him steal away in the night, leaving their mother homeless, he also enlists David as ""lookout"" in various crimes, from stealing government property to committing a murder.<br /><br />David and the siblings all struggle, yet manage to carve out lives for themselves. Perhaps the main legacy from Thurston is determination and a refusal to surrender.<br /><br />An important subtext in this book is the grinding poverty and squalor of the Navajo communities that the Crow family live in throughout the 1950s and 60s. David Crow saw it up close and understands the dichotomy between the tourist version of Native American life and the often unbearable reality.<br /><br />Many of David's schoolmates on the reservation reflect the option of giving in and giving up. David did not do these things. He misbehaved and failed in school but ultimately kept moving forward. With only a few people in his life to encourage him and serve as role models, he came to understand that life can be better, regardless of how it looks in the beginning. It is an inspiring story.",5.0,1,2022
Nature Essays,"Barry Lopez was a humanitarian, environmentalist, world traveler and a National Book Award winning writer. His books (including Artic Dreams, Of Wolves and Men,  Horizon, and Crossing Open Ground) have deservedly earned him something of a cult following.<br /><br />His last book, Embrace Fearlessly the Burning World is a collection of essays, mostly about nature and culture with some personal stories (warning: includes sexual abuse).  In all of his works Barry Lopez shared with us his spiritual reverence for the  natural world and everything in it.  His expertise across disparate fields was remarkable.<br /><br />In Embrace Fearlessly the Burning World,  Lopez is forthcoming about the dangers we are facing and reminds of us of the need to be better stewards of everything found in nature. I particularly enjoyed his respectful portrayal of indigenous populations, recognizing all they have to offer in terms of wisdom and ways of being in the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this beautiful memoir of a life well-lived,  We can all benefit from following his example focusing on the journey rather than the destination  and  immersing ourselves in nature as often as possible.<br /><br />Thank  you to Random House for a drc.

"Ayn Rand on the subtitle for a book about ""better capitalism""?","Confessions: 1. Haven't read the book, but did read the bios of the two authors and the content overview; 2. I'm a professional college economist, 33 years standing, with an additional degree in electrical engineering.  That said, I always find it depressing when people who are not deeply trained in economics publish tomes claiming to provide some new, deep insight in economic society. Neither of these authors are trained nor have they worked professionally in applying economic principles. That, and adding the name of a fully discredited novelist, Ayn Rand, to the title of their book shows how little they comprehend of the issues, politics, and imperfections of American-style capitalism. Rand herself apparently had no understanding that Smith delineated the inherent flaws in pure market capitalism, and wrote as if those flaws never crossed her intellectual landscape. When you add the various constaints and shortcomings of the U.S. Constitution, with its limiting of government oversight of business corruption, monopoly, graft, and concentration, you see the complexity of the problems facing America. Ethics and morality are fine, and make a good starting point for discussing the changes that, ideally, would make America a more just place, but without significant amendments to the Constitution and the legal and regulatory systems that would necessarily arise, those ethical ponderings are simply pie in the sky.",2.0,0,2022
This one is a keeper!,"This is a really precious book. The love he had for his four children was very evident.  Some of this correspondence must have been so time-consuming.  And his artwork!  I spent so much time admiring his deceptively simply drawings.<br /><br />He ""sent"" these letters and illustrations starting when his oldest was young, and wrote one every year after.  What an imagination he had!  He would change up his handwriting, alternate ink colors, and have comments in the margins written by his helpers, all with their own distinctive writing.  He also described comical stories and anecdotes from the North Pole, decorated the margins and script, composed a clever funny poem for his daughter, and included gorgeous drawings detailing the stories he had told within the letter.  The sweet detail in these letters, even down to the ""postage stamps"", was so thoughtful and beautiful to see.  He even came up with an original alphabet made of runes.<br /><br />Two things leant a melancholic feel.  First was the absence of adressees as time went by.  Eventually the boys grew up and didn't believe in Father Christmas any more, so the letters were just addressed to his youngest, Priscilla.  The second was WWII was happening.<br /><br />These letters must have been precious to his children as they kept them safe.  Can you imagine being a little child and believing in Santa Clause, and then having these wonderful, magical letters sent to you?

Not good,"I started reading this based on the author’s description of the book on tiktok, but I’m at 23% and honestly can’t read about this main character another second. She literally broke up with her abusive and controlling boyfriend yesterday, meets her brother’s roommate (who was sleeping with a random girl right after they met), and the next day acts all jealous and possessive because he’s going on a date. Seriously, what’s wrong with this girl? You’ve known the guy for less than 24 hours, maybe chill out for a minute. She’s a total doormat with no self respect, and acting like she’s all love at first sight just screamed pathetic to me. I honestly couldn’t deal with her “hurt feelings” after having like one or two interactions with this guy to care whether she ended up dating him or not. Really, the only people I liked in the story are her brother and Gibbs (a different roommate). Reads more like a harlequin insta-love story. Not a fan.",1.0,0,2022
Another near miss by Dante King,"I like Dante's writing style.  His tales flow well, with enough detail to make the tale interesting, but no major grammar errors to distract the reader.  That has been the thing that has always impressed me with his writing.<br /><br />Sadly, while I like his style, I find his plot decisions to be less than ideal.  This tale suffered from many of the problems that can infest harem tales.  The hero was bland and a bit of a zero to start with.  The girls lacked some personality and felt a bit like they were more props for the hero to mate with.  And then the enemy was overly powerful which resulted in plot armor at high levels.<br /><br />Frustrating for me to read, and I can only give it a three star.

The characters were flat, and the storytelling was lacking a little.

There are wounds that never show on the body,"There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds. ~ Laurell K. Hamilton<br /><br />Quote from the book:  Elizabeth was not a typical light-eyed redhead, with spotty porcelain skin — though there were a few sun-kissed freckles on her perfectly shaped nose. Miss Bingley called her skin ‘brown’ and ‘coarse’ when it was actually golden — a bit exotic, even.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet has suffered all her life from being born a redhead — the only redhead in her immediate family or, indeed, in anyone’s memory of her extended family or ancestors.  The problem is not just that society favors blondes or that her mother favors the daughters who look most like herself.  Elizabeth is rejected at every turn by her father.<br /><br />So, when a gentleman, newly arrived in the neighborhood, refers to her with a “ginger” slur — carrot-headed chit, indeed — she is hurt beyond imagining.  And when he impulsively proposes to her — “if you can call a couple of sentences muttered from atop a horse a proposal” — she laughs. As Lydia would say, “What a joke!’’<br /><br />Often, it’s the deepest pain which empowers you to grow into your highest self. ~ Karen Salmansohn<br /><br />That same gentleman, one Fitzwilliam Darcy, escapes from Meryton with his pride barely intact.  Darcy suffers from lack of sleep, too many responsibilities, and a general feeling of unwellness.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  Why could not the people in his life manage themselves? Why must he repeat to his aunt, again and again, a rejection so distasteful to her? Why could not Bingley heed the countless warnings already given him? Why should Miss Bingley look to him as her brother’s caretaker?<br /><br />Darcy cancels a visit to his Aunt Catherine and travels instead to Ramsgate to visit his sister.  Disaster!<br /><br />His sister is with his enemy, George Wickham, and planning an elopement.  In fury, Darcy turns red, staggers, and falls unconscious.  He awakens — how many days later? He has no idea — bound in a strange bed.  Unable to understand most speech and unable to speak without curse words, his doctor considers him insane.<br /><br />Trauma is a fact of life.  It does not, however, have to be a life sentence. ~ Peter A. Levine<br /><br />In Darcy’s case, the trauma might well be a life sentence.  His relations have accepted the doctor’s diagnosis that Darcy is insane.  Unfortunately, that diagnosis fits in nicely with certain financial issues plaguing the Fitzwilliams.  Lady Catherine has her own agenda which could be fulfilled.<br /><br />When Elizabeth is banished from Longbourn after her refusal of the Collins’ proposal, she visits Ramsgate and re-enters the life of Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />The art of healing comes from nature and not from the physician.  Therefore, the physician must start from nature with an open mind. ~ Paracelsus<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet has always been interested in natural medicines.  She is able to aid both Georgiana and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but first, they must escape from those who keep them confined.<br /><br />Elizabeth also has a need for healing:  what will it take for her to stop wearing linen caps in an effort to hide her red hair?  Even Jane shows a lack from her upbringing.  Perfect Jane needs to heal too.<br /><br />If you like a lot of Darcy/Elizabeth page time, this is a book for you!  The story drew me in from the opening pages; the drama endured to the end.  I loved it!<br /><br />Healing is an art.<br />It takes time.<br />It takes practice.<br />It takes love.<br />~ Maza Dohta<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",5.0,1,2022

"Desperate Woman Meets Rich Entrepreneur Who Wants a Paid ""Girlfriend""","Reading Rebecca Kelley's book ""No One Knows Us Here,"" was a slow burn experience for me. I empathized right away with protagonist Rosemary, who had dreams of being a lawyer, but was in the throes of a very challenging financial struggle - working retail, studying for LSATs, and literally living in a closet in an apartment shared by four roommates. Things got even more complicated when her younger half-sister, Wendy, showed up and wanted to move in with her. Rosemary and Wendy's parents were dead, so Wendy was living with her grandmother, but was miserable there. She even attempted suicide, forcing Rosemary to desperate measures to try to earn enough money to get a separate apartment and be able to support herself and her little sister.  Her first choice was so repulsive that I thought I would have to stop reading the book, but Rosemary couldn't go through with it, so I kept reading. The real drama started when Rosemary was courted by Leo Glass, a famous (but unknown to Rosemary) technological entrepreneur, who wanted to hire Rosemary to be his ""girlfriend.""  He would provide a wonderful apartment for Wendy and Rosemary, and he would not live there.  In addition, he would pay her $6000 per month.  They wouldn't see each other that much, just for public appearances and whenever he returned home from his world travels for business. Ironically, Rosemary met her next-door neighbor in the new apartment building and developed feelings for him, but had to reject him to continue to collect on Leo's offer.  Leo turned out to be a world class creep.  He was controlling, cruel, and demanding. He spied on her constantly through the software programs he developed for street cameras and unique next generation smart phones.  Although not often, their arrangement did include sexual privileges, and that is where his worst instincts played out. Unfortunately for Leo, his violating behaviors reminded Rosemary of her long-repressed hatred for her stepfather, who had raped her for years. In the past, she had fantasized about having killed him, and the urges returned with a vengeance when Rosemary found out he had raped Wendy, too. Will Leo go too far?  What will Rosemary do to stop him?  I raced through the final chapters to find out.",4.0,1,2022
Walking the Same Grounds 112 Years Apart,"Walking the same grounds 112 years apart readers will find Lisa Wingate's two main narrators for her best-selling historical novel, ""The Book of Lost Friends.""  Hannie Gossett is a young sharecropper of 1875 who was separated from her family in the slave trade.  Benny Silva is a recent grad embarking on her first teaching job in 1987.  Both young ladies are connected to the Louisiana properties of the wealthy Gossett Family, whose fortune grew from slave labor on their plantation. In the action from 1875, ""Mister"" Gossett sets off to find his wayward son, but never returns.  If he is dead, Hannie worries that his widow will not honor the terms of the sharecropping agreement, which should soon turn over the ""forty acres and a mule"" to Hannie and her friends. Another young woman surfaces with her future riding on Mr. Gossett's well-being.  She is Juneau Jane, his illegitimate daughter from his long-standing relationship with a Creole woman in New Orleans.  Mr. Gossett has promised her an inheritance, but she needs documentation to prove it. Meanwhile, Mr. Gossett's daughter with his wife, Missy Lavinia, is determined to freeze her half-sister out. Lavinia lures Juneau June on a mission to find Mr. Gossett's lawyer.  Hannie, a former slave to the Gossetts, disguises herself as a boy io order to drive their wagon without Lavinia realizing who she is. Amid the jeopardy of their perilous trip, Hannie seeks refuge in a church, where she discovers newspaper clippings seeking information on relatives who were torn apart by slave trading. The existence of these public notices (the original Book of Lost Friends, which inspired Wingate's novel) renews Hannie's hope that she might be able to locate her mother and siblings as the trio searches for Mr. Gossett.<br /><br />Benny Silva is a 1987 transplant from California attempting to have her student loans forgiven by teaching for a few years in a high-poverty school. She is totally unprepared to meet the challenges that await her.  The students are undisciplined, unmotivated, and suffer from food insecurity. There are no teaching resources except one classroom set of Orwell's ""Animal Farm,"" a book that does not capture the students' interest. Through serendipity, a leaky roof leads Benny to meet her elusive landlord, Nathan Gossett, who has inherited the dilapidated mansion and surrounding cottages.  After Benny encounters some colorful locals at a diner, she hatches the idea to motivate her students by engaging them in the rich history of their town and their ancestors.  The Book of Lost Friends and two separate cemeteries located at the Gossett Estate play a prominent part in their research.<br /><br />Wingate alternates the narrators' stories with each chapter, which builds suspense for the reader. I could hardly wait to find out if Mr. Gossett was dead or alive and if Benny would be fired for stepping outside the comfort zone of the town's establishment. Romantic liaisons develop for both Hannie and Benny, and the phrase ""lost friends"" takes on even more significance in the final chapters. I'm so glad that Lisa Wingate chose to shine a light on the cruel separation of enslaved families by writing this marvelous book.",5.0,1,2022
This is a wonderful Christmas spirited story!,"Fallon was on her way to write a story of a town that was boosted as a Christmas spirited town in Vermont.

I get the series name now,"Lol!!! I was like Five packs? Ok so each book in this series is a tie in between each pack and the alphas that lead each one and the choices they've made in rejecting their mates and how they redeem themselves and also the subplot of the dynamics of pack life and the ever revolving threat they face, from each other and elsewhere.  Got it.<br />I absolutely loved the first book in the series. I was not expecting to read about high schoolers this time around. Kinda threw me off, but this author is truly becoming one of my faves and I was pretty invested in Cadoc and Rosie's story. Had more of a star crossed lovers vibe. Cadoc being from privilege and prestige and Rosie basically the equivalent of a country bumpkin?<br />While reading this I came to realize that although I love Cate C. Wells writing and her character driven stories and the messages she infuses in them, I find it a bit strange that the leads in both stories have very little chemistry. Like its there, kinda. Its just always lukewarm at best. It doesn't take away from the story whatsoever, for me at least. Because there's a lot going on and I'm completely engaged but yeah its not like ohhhh  this is what I'm talking about heat, ya know?<br />So yeah I'm definitely intrigued by why the men choose to reject their mates and then fix that bs real quick lol!!! Also, I'm feeling bummed that Rosie's wolf wasn't more at the forefront. Like with Una's wolf we totally got a feel for her. But with Rosie's everything seemed like an afterthought and this story took so long to develop. Like they weren't together enough. Maybe because they are just kids? And they didn't have a relationship of any kind before so we needed more turmoil for them to overcome? I'm not sure. It wasn't as satisfying as Killian and Una's story or even Derwyn and Enid's novella had more chemistry and heart than this one did.<br />Don't get me wrong this one definitely had plenty going for it and I did get worked up more than once and it's also way funnier and fun than the first, but I guess they aren't my fave couple? What made it for me were the side characters, the class divisions narrative and how Cadoc and Rosie are going to create a stronger more united pack and the snippets of Rosie's colossal wolf that's like a big dog that thinks its a lap dog and when Cadoc finally seems more man than machine.<br />All in all I enjoyed this story and can't wait for book three!!!!",4.0,1,2022
Excellent sequel!,"Inspired by Dr. Rose's third book that builds on his foundational work of first two books ""End of Average"" and ""Dark Horse.""

"I love the characters SO much, lots of laughs, feels, and some nice spice","I am up to date with the story, and really enjoyed everything I read. I dont rehash what I read (not a book report here), but just my overall impression. Fun thing about reading, what we choose and enjoy is highly subjective. Something you love, I may fine stupid. Something I love you may not be able to handle. Whatever. Give something a try and move on.<br /><br />The Levelling Up series was not something I expected to like. I had learned of this book on a random FB sponsored ad. I dont recall what drew me to it, but let me tell you none of this is my typical genre to read from. I think it was the appeal of reading of a character in her 40s. I'm in my 40s. Nice to see the main star to be someone outside the typical 20 something. Figured I'd give it a go, and if I didnt like it I have the option to stop, yes?<br /><br />The first chapter was meh. Though, I tend to be a little snarfy when I first begin a new book. Takes a little to get into it. But then once it started rolling, I was so very much hooked. I think once I realized that the writer can write, can flesh out detail, can give life to not only main characters, but give a lot to side characters, and I can imagine the surroundings so well yet am not spoon fed all everything. I was impressed, and hoked. I cant get enough, I could read from this world forever more. Love the characters, all the fun quirky details, and the lovely boost to my imagination.<br /><br />If you aren't reading KF Breene, you should. Very funny, lots of wonderful side characters, and the main story has some meat. But I could read all about the Levelling Up world without any story line. I just LOVE hanging out with all the characters. Funny stuff, hot stuff, some feels. Not overlly dramatic. And not at all scary despite some freaky stuff going on.<br /><br />And yes, there are ridiculously hot guys in this, with cringey names (I suspect it is an intentional nod toward the lame romantic tripe of so called romance books). Stop clutching your pearls long enough to just enjoy this. It's a slow burn, and please feel free to enjoy it. OR dont pick up a fantasy (on many levels) book.<br /><br />If the details in this book freak you out, then you wont be able to handle the intense spice of some of her other work. Ruin of Roses, comes to mind. That is another incredible story with loads of detail, awesome side characters, but the heat is turned way way way up. Wowza. Well done.. mm hhmmm",5.0,1,2022
Worth reading,"Former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone tells of his life before, during, and after the January 6 insurrection.  He tells of his early days of policing as an undercover cop.  He then tells of the January 6 insurrection when he and his partner self-deployed to the Capitol to help the other cops being overrun by the rioters.  He then tells of the aftermath immediately after January 6 and months later.<br /><br />I found this interesting.  Though I knew a lot about January 6 and some of the aftermath, I learned more about it.  Michael Fanone tells his story in writing exactly as he comes across on television.  He is uncensored and real.  He puts on no airs.  What you see is what you get.  I liked seeing how he came up through the police force.  When he told of being in the insurrection, I felt like I was right beside him.  It was chilling.  I could feel his strong emotions after as he takes on his union and the MPD for their stance on standing by their officers (or lack thereof.)  I also appreciated that he gave solutions as to what needs to be done to improve policing in the United States.<br /><br />This is a book worth reading.  I hope nothing but good comes his way.",5.0,1,2022
sweet romance but format issues,"Rating: 3.5🌈<br /><br />How Not To Marry a Prince by Megan Derr is a very sweet fantasy romance, very typical of Derr in terms of location and types of characters.<br /><br />I found myself delighted by the main character, Prince Amador, his love of numbers, and, romance. Amador is such a kind, sweet endearing person.  That makes the idea of people drawn to his personality and warmth understandable.  And the romance that follows believable.<br /><br />The thing that throws the book and entire story off is that the beginning chapter has been placed at the end of the novel.<br /><br />Now whether this is by choice or accident I have no idea. But it’s highly annoying.  You miss Prince Amador’s arrival into the kingdom and all sorts of important information.<br /><br />So if you’re going to read this story, go to the back of the book, read the first chapter there, then proceed with the rest of the story.<br /><br />It’s really why it didn’t get a higher rating.<br /><br />If a book is for sale, and this is a accidental format issue, fix it. If this is on purpose, well, I found it irritating.<br /><br />Still a sweet story.",4.0,1,2022
"unlikable main character, lack of logic in universe.","It seems that once again I ran into a main character I just did not like.  In this tale the story starts with the usual ""man died and brought to new world to live again"".  Of course there are conditions and in this instance those conditions are near crippling levels of debt in a world with a seriously messed up economy that involves law abiding people and a ton of gambling (and the ensuing violence to try to influence the odds.)<br /><br />And this tale managed very quickly to turn me off.  The only real companion the man has at first is an AI who is so stupid it actually sells off the man's spaceship (at a loss) when his communicator gets destroyed after an attempt to kill him for winning a big bet.  Yes, his AI sells the space ship without even confirming his death.  This results in him purchasing a new ship (because his bet made more than enough money to replace the old one), but instead of going small and staying out of debt for the moment, the man goes absurdly into debt to purchase a larger ship that requires a crew and all.<br /><br />And the story pretty much lost me at that point.  The hero was not heroic after the initial scene that brought him to the world.  instead he dittered and worried himself into inaction.  he argues with his AI companion (who isn't fun or interesting in the slightest.) and never made me feel like he was worth reading about.<br /><br />So as you can guess I noped out of this tale after a while.  I just couldn't find the characters or the plot compelling.  The combination of the complete lack of a solid well thoughtout foundation for the tale and the way the main character seemed a passenger in the tale just left me uninterested.<br /><br />But this is not a case where the writing is objectively bad.  I did not like the plot and felt the character was poor, but the story is well-written and I could see that the writer had an idea.  So I'm willing to put this into my 3 star category where I say that some people might find this very enjoyable, but warn that its definitely not for all readers.",3.0,0,2022
"Story develops well, but slowly.","The story is detailed and interesting with establishment of an alien cultural context, but its goal is very slow to apprehend. The creation of an alien culture with beings who speak in English is a standard situation in science fiction, so it does not seem to be an impediment to reading enjoyment. What is an impediment, in my opinion, is that the writing seems not to have been carefully edited. Pardon me for detailing the errors in diction (word choice) and in punctuation (missing commas) among other defects in the first 50 or 60 pages (at least at my Kindle's level of text size and format).<br /><br />> ""the ceiling hanged over them""  HUNG is the proper past tense form for inanimate objects; HANGED is used for humans.<br />> ""cheated a peak at his""  PEEK<br />> ""Well done warrior""  A comma is standard after a statement addressed to a person, as in ""Well done, warrior.""<br />> ""reflected off of her gown""  A double (and redundant) preposition should be ""reflected off her gown.""<br />> ""He honed in on the face""  HONED means to sharpen a blade; the word here should be HOMED (as in homing pigeon).<br />> ""we look out for one another other""  The extraneous word OTHER should have easily been caught by a careful and diligent editor/proofreader.<br />> ""Don't eat too much Mo""  Another missing comma before the person being addressed.<br />> ""headed for the mess hall Pappy""  Still another missing comma before the person being addressed.<br />These conventions of word choice and punctuation are Standard English and are addressed in most Standard English grammar and punctuation guides. The errors get in the way of smooth reading and interrupts the reader's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" every time the reader stumbles across any distraction from the story to focus on the writing.",3.0,0,2022
not bad but not great,"As far as BL love stories go this is is about average. The biggest issue is with how much this story could use a good editor. Far too much passive telling and not enough showing. The story is confusing in parts because the voice changes mid page, for no apparent reason other than to narrate something in Jay’ head before returning to Luci’s POV. It also suffers from what I call narrative impatience. There is a decision to be made: is this a fluff romance or meant to be serious? If it’s fluff then the lack of depth and character development is fine. It can be a bit of light wish fulfillment with magic thrown in randomly and with poorly mapped out cities because ultimately they don’t matter. However, if it is supposed to be more serious, the story needs more time and space to develop. Escape shouldn’t be that easy, nor should everything be so conveniently easy to achieve. A ring just given because “let me pay it forward”. Inns where a screaming child is soothed by a stranger. And for the record No Mom would allow a stranger to come in the middle of the night and handle their child. Five scouts being sent into a haunted elf forest on their own to what? Pick blackberries? Also, what the heck are modern references like “Stockholm Syndrome” doing in a period fantasy piece? Anyhow, I’m being pretty generous with my three star rating but it’s not high fantasy and I was able to finish it in under two hours.",3.0,0,2022
... we are better judges of convenience than we are of love. ~ Mignon McLaughlin,"The marriage of convenience has this to recommend it: we are better judges of convenience than we are of love. ~ Mignon McLaughlin<br /><br />“The Barrister’s Bride” is a story of convenience in marriage — to wit, an arranged marriage.<br /><br />As the story opens, Mr. Bennet is in the great bookroom beyond our sphere.  Jane and Elizabeth spend most of their time in London with the Gardiners.  Their mother and other sisters still reside in Meryton.  A chance encounter at a London ball is repeated when the sisters visit Hertfordshire and Fitzwilliam Darcy visits his friend Bingley at Netherfield Park.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  Fitz’s thoughts were consumed with whether he would have the opportunity to meet her again — and tonight was his chance. Now, how was he to go about approaching her? A reserved sort, he had never been as socially oriented as his older brother, George. Some might have even called him shy. His diffident nature never mattered to him in the past.<br /><br />Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth meet and a friendship begins.  Elizabeth enjoys the beginning but she notices that the gentleman is sometimes charming; sometimes contrary; and sometimes avoids her.  Confusion reigns.<br /><br />Fitzwilliam Darcy knows something that Elizabeth Bennet does not:  that his Uncle Darcy, who had taken Fitzwilliam under his wing as a young boy and supported his career, had arranged a marriage for him with the daughter of an old friend from his school days.  Fitzwilliam is not free to form an attachment and fights against his attraction.  He does not know his intended’s name.  He knows only that the girl is not aware of the betrothal but will be told when she reaches her majority.  Meanwhile, Fitzwilliam must bide his time as best he can.<br /><br />By chance, the older Darcy brother, George, and George Wickham arrive in Meryton also.  When the Bennet sisters meet them, the two Georges are drunk and rude to the ladies. Fortunately, their stay in Hertfordshire is very brief.<br /><br />The prudence of the best heads is often defeated by the tenderness of the best hearts. ~ Henry Fielding<br /><br />The story continues in London where Jane and Elizabeth meet again with Bingley and George Darcy, who appears to be courting Elizabeth.  He is charming and Elizabeth enjoys his company.<br /><br />Fitzwilliam is also in London at the time, but his work as a barrister keeps him very busy.  His contact with the Bennets is limited.<br /><br />Do not trust all men, but trust men of worth; the former course is silly, the latter a mark of prudence. ~ Democritus<br /><br />Canon Elizabeth Bennet is a clever girl who makes certain character misjudgments.  In this story, her misjudgments border on stupidity.  She forgets her initial opinion of George Darcy and George Wickham and puts trust in both men.<br /><br />The story was fast-paced at the beginning and end.  The middle section seemed a bit bogged down with unnecessary details, but I will overlook that in light of the originality of the story. Unique plot; lovable Darcy; independent Elizabeth, and a happy ending. What more could I want?<br /><br />True love stories never have endings. ~Richard Bach<br /><br />EPILOGUES — some folks love them; some folks hate them!

A GOOD START TO A NEW SERIES,"I was looking for a new series to dive into as I have finished reading Louise Penny's series about Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and Donna Leon's series about Commimssario Guido Brunetti and decided to read the first book in the Bruno, Chief of Police series.  I was not disappointed.  One of the things I enjoy about Louise Penny and Donna Leon's work is being immersed in their locale (Quebec and Venice) and the cultures of the people.  I enjoy getting acquainted with the main characters and their friends and families who all become friends and I can see this happening with Bruno and the charming characters of his French village.<br /><br />Chief of Police Bruno is a quiet, peaceful man who loves food and wine - both of which are described in vivid detail that I find delightful.  He is very serious about his job and taking care of the people in St. Denis.  Despite his quiet nature, Bruno is a complex character and getting to know him better will be a pleasure.<br /><br />This is not a plot driven book as the mystery is almost secondary to the personalities involved.  There is a murder and it involves the complicated history of France during WWII.  I found the history fascinating and learned a great deal about the French occupation and resistance.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a delightful character-driven novel and who wants to make new friends along the way. It is not a fast moving book but one to curl up with and savor.",4.0,1,2022

Just not for me,"I didn't like this book at all. It sounded like a great book when I bought it, but once I got into it, it didn't go anywhere. There wasn't much of a plot or a subplot since things just seemed to happen without any sort of thought or planning. The characters were wishy-washy and I couldn't connect with any of them, although I do think Buchanan is a man of honor, even if he did steal Rhedyn. In his own words, he did the wrong thing for the right reason.<br /><br />Rhedyn is considered the enemy at the Mackenzie's. Her father was blamed for killing Buchanan's half-brother, Iain, who was raiding without Buchanan's knowledge or permission. Buchanan wants to avoid bloodshed, unlike some of his other kin, and takes Rhedyn until the truth comes out.<br /><br />So, we have people in the household plotting to get rid of Rhedyn, even if Buchanan has taken a liking to her, and we have the evil cousin, Hamish, wanting to challenge Buchanan for the lairdship, since Hamish thinks Buchanan is weak and not worthy of being laird. Meanwhile, another man has been vying for Rhedyn's hand in marriage through her father with contracts and all of that and Buchanan has already married her with the blessing of the Church. Oh, and let's not forget that Rhedyn's father marries a dead woman so his bastard son can be his heir. Strange.<br /><br />I found the pace of the book to be slow and uneven, and I didn't care about even one of the characters. In addition to that, there were no character descriptions other than Buchanan had dark blonde hair and topaz eyes. I saw that once. And if that's the case, who is the dude on the cover? There were no more character descriptions other than a mention that Rhedyn had hazel eyes. What about everything else for both main characters? Long hair, short hair, color of their hair--what? Why is it so hard to throw in a description or two of characters? Sorry, but it's getting frustrating for me. So many authors just don't do it and in my opinion, the romance genre depends upon it.<br /><br />I also like the people on the covers of books to at least bear a resemblance to someone in the book. The guy on this cover is handsome to be sure, but from the vague description we got of Buchanan, it isn't him and since there were no descriptions of anyone else, the man on the cover remains a mystery.<br /><br />Just my two cents, not that anybody cares.<br /><br />End.",2.0,0,2022

Whether or not one agrees with the author is not the point.

"Good lord, what an overwrought, over written and ultimately disappointing book","This is an author in dire need of an editor or perhaps just someone else to write for her. I fail to understood the enthusiasm for her work if this is a representative example. The characters are either cardboard or we have inflicted on us an endless internal monologue of each which is neither interesting nor, in most cases, does it advance the plot. Labeling each chapter with the character is a requirement because there's nothing else that would indicate any kind of individual voice. It's fairly obvious where this thing is going and, unfortunately, early on there's just enough to indicate that it might be fun to find out. It is not. Unsympathetic characters doing boring things with ridiculous motivations or sometimes the complete lack of them do not make for a good experience. Not recommended.",3.0,0,2022
Stuck In Limbo,"I was thoroughly captivated from the beginning of this book, only to be very disappointed with myself when I realized I had messed up.<br />This was an interlibrary e-book loan, and I had totally forgetten until it was too late and automatically removed and returned from my books. Turns out the wait time was over 3 weeks so it was easier just to start over when it finally arrived-again.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the majority of this book. As usual though, with any read, there were a couple of things I found great delight in, as well as a couple of things that I didn't care for or that flat out annoyed me.<br /><br />So well written, it draws you in with the flow of the writing. Loved the main character and her back story. It reels you in moving forward, causing you to want more, and being disappointed when you really must put the book down for a bit.

Now, I'm anxiously awaiting the release. Argh!<br /><br />One part where I got annoyed was during a majorly intense  battle where things were presented almost too fast and hard. It caused me to feel overwhelmed, and I was having trouble following along and keeping up, let alone to separate out and understand what everyone was saying. All at once, ""truths"" started coming out from all the major players in the book and I actually had to re-read them a couple of times, in order to understand what exactly was the importance and weight of all the information that had previously been withheld. It became a huge overload of information. I felt like I was going to short circuit at one point from the massive  dumping of data.<br /><br />It wasn't enough for me not to continue reading, and the ending itself, all made it worthwhile.

This Place of Wonder !,"What I liked most about this book is that Barbara O'Neal wrote is so I felt as if I was in each scene,with each character.  I adore Meadow and Augustus and the life they shared and built in the farm to table food lifestyle. I read each page and could see and feel the beautiful Art Deco home and all the gorgeous tiles and see myself sitting on the edge of the pool that sparkled while overlooking the coast of southern California.  I think I now own each and every book Barbara has written because I love to reread these type of novels written for women that involve food in some way.

A TOUR DE FORCE ASSESSMENT AND COMMENTARY,"A MUST READ FOR ALL ROMAN CATHOLICS, EVEN MODERNISTS WHO HAVE THE SPIRITUAL COURAGE TO SEEK THE TRUE FAITH. Bishop Schneider has freely and forcefully given the reader a full disclosure of his uncompromising faith in Traditional Roman Catholicism and Holy Mother Church. He does not  provide any apologia for the illegitimate papal acts, teachings, and dictatorial attempts to eliminate the Mass of the Ages. Rather, his commentary provides invaluable, factual information to the reader  as to why these critical errors occurred and why they do not conform with the 2,000 years of Holy Mother Church's  uncompromising adherence to her Apostolic tradition.",5.0,1,2022
I tried so hard to love it,"So let me start off by saying, I don’t read books to be critical, I read them to get lost. I usually glaze right over grammar or writing issues. However, I was beyond frustrated with this entire book.<br /><br />Primarily it was the fact the same issue was repeated numerous, only slightly different ways. You can only take so much of the main character doubting themselves, or stating the exact same thing over and over. At one point I literally checked to make sure I hadn’t re-read the same page. WE GET IT, SHE DOUBTS HERSELF! WE GET IT, SHE BLAMES HERSELF! These were not necessary hills to repeatedly reinforce the same way.<br /><br />My other major issue with this book was the lack of information, I get that it’s part of the plot for a lot of the story to yet unfold. However you have to at least give us a taste. The absolute only “plot twist” or climax of this book was apparent from the start. We spent an entire book in the same setting, learning little to nothing about this world. The only thing that was set up was some mild character development. It wasn’t even that great either!! The slow moving was really my biggest issue. The most interesting part was the last 12 pages. How disappointing.<br /><br />I do want to say this also had some strong likeness to the “50 shades of grey” series. Did it start out as some weird fan fiction? Because Daleon tries to control her, worries about her eating, plenty of “kinky” sub/dom play. The parallels seemed similar, I could absolutely see both of the main characters having similar characteristics.<br /><br />All in all, maybe I’ll read the next book? I mean I liked the overall setup of the worlds, the plot setup, etc. I just really wish the books moved quicker and didn’t beat a dead horse over and over.",2.0,0,2022
Weird Characters and a Suspenseful Story,"This is a compellingly interesting read, with suspense building from the beginning and plenty of unexpected twists. The pastor and his family have changed locations but have left behind the pastor’s resentful and bitter son Tom, a young man disgusted that his dad has left the family home and insists that he move out, too. The problems begin with a mom and her teen daughter move into the main house while Tom is in the guest cottage. Jess, the daughter, is not happy either since her mom has left her dad and their wealthy enclave behind. Jess is a child of privilege and wants to continue to pursue her previous lifestyle. The characters are all a little strange and none of them is what I expected. The mom has had multiple cosmetic surgeries but is still not happy with herself. Her husband is consumed with making money and grabbing more success. Meanwhile, the pastor’s wife misses her old home and returns to visit the former church. The events unroll methodically, with a lot of details given to the atmosphere and the past. When the past conflicts with the present reality, the suspense was non-stop and the book was hard to put down. The beginning was a little slow-paced, but it picked up quickly and then kept up the fast pace after about the first third of the book. The characters were well-developed, with a lot of necessary background information given for each of them. The ending left me gaping because I really didn’t suspect what would happen in spite of all of the clues that were given throughout the book. This is an enjoyable suspense book with shades of the dark and macabre at times. I almost (note that word) felt bad for Tom, but he is not terribly likable, so in the end, I was content with his outcome. Fans of dark suspense will enjoy this book and be amazed by the intricate details of the lives of the characters.<br />Disclaimer<br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

Mr. Koontz imagination keeps me intrigued,"I have been reading Dean Koontz's novels since 1978 and this novel is another good stretch of creative imagination in the good versus evil theme that is my fav genre (which applies to memoirs to mystery, thrillers). A little predictable for me in the young man hero and accompanying dog. I will state that I am only 88% through the book but felt that always pressing need to keep reading. The evil in this book come from a unique place (other worldly, or maybe not). Paranormal talents for some are what make this story possible but at times too easy. Earlier works of Mr. Koontz are more dramatic mind bending. This is worth reading if you are a fan! Don't let the familiarity with his writing turn you away from some of the predictable elements that are a signature of his writing. After all, that is what draws me back to pre-ordering his books. I will certainly go re-read Watchers, Twilight Eyes, The Face and Darkfall before I re-read this one but I do appreciate his imagination stretching to meet the desolate evil that continues to evolve in the real world.",4.0,1,2022
I don’t think he’s wrong,"…But this book still isn’t very good.  I definitely think that people who think that the government or military would never do something like invent a subversive subculture to protect their interests in war are a bit naïve.  They would.  They did. I had noticed before I read this that people like John Denver(one of the only people mentioned in this book who I think had literally any talent along with poor Jimi Hendrix) had a high ranking military father and thought it was a bit…interesting.<br />  This book, unfortunately, still isn’t very well written.  Idk if it’s just because I didn’t live back then and didn’t know the bands, etc but I found the story hard to care about after the first few chapters. Hollywood and related people are sexually debauched, well no duh. Common knowledge in this day and age (post-Weinstein and kevin spacey me-too era) but maybe not in 2014 and before. The Author goes off on tangents that are confusing and makes no additional points supporting his argument.  I would say the biggest argument in favor of the author being correct is that all that music from the groups mentioned are very bad and forgettable.  I knew a few Zappa and Neil Young songs because of my dad, but I googled CSNY and never heard a single one. Their name is literally more famous than their music.  The Byrds to me are relegated to Turn Turn Turn.  I had heard that single Buffalo Springfield song but it’s idk it’s whatever.  My guess is some music from my generation like godawful overplayed Nirvana were created similarly and promoted everywhere.<br />All in all it’s a shame because I totally think he’s onto something, but it’s lost in the mess of prose that is this goofy little book.  Worth it to read to chapter 3-4, then see if you can return it lol.",3.0,0,2022
"well-written, spicy and dark story, completed series, on to the next!","This book started with a bang and didn’t stop! Oh my gosh, I loved it!<br />Spicy, violent, RH, multiple perspectives, dark bully romance (not that bad though) with lots of dark themes. Lots of touch her and you die vibes. Mmm. Everything I LOVE.<br />Heads up that there’s a playlist linked at the back of the e-book (or I’m sure you can find it on the author’s page too) that I wish I had found earlier and could have jammed to while reading. I’ll be checking for book two’s playlist before I dive in.<br />I picked this book up after a DNF book that was poorly written, so maybe I came into it biased but oh, this was So Well Written!! There’s just enough description to feel real and embedded in the story, but also not too much over description that you can’t imagine the little details yourself.<br />I freaking LOVED Ava Jade (AJ)! She was such a badA, and strong, and feisty, but also really endearing and vulnerable at times. Mostly hard though – which I so admire! As a big softie myself, there’s nothing better than living a story through a tough as nails protagonist!<br />There’s multiple perspectives in the book, so you get to see the side of the story from Ava Jade, Corvus, Rook, and Grey. There’s just enough backstory for each to get you invested but also hints at more that really draw you in and make you want to binge this whole series straight away! I’m so glad I put off starting this series until the fourth book came out because I’m going to do just that.<br />The spice in this book is just right – fast paced but also believable, and dirty and raw, and while the guys come up with pet names for AJ I’m thrilled that this author made them actual pet names and not your typical dark romance of slurs. Such a relief!<br />Dark themes for sure, I imagine there’s trigger warnings you can check if you want a heads up but I loved the surprise. Trigger warnings to me can sometimes be check boxes of “yes I want that, and that too, and yes put that cherry on top” but also can spoil it a little, so I stuck with the quick warning on the Amazon description and jumped in.<br />Again, well-written, spicy and dark story, completed series, on to the next! New favorite author for sure.",5.0,1,2022
An evolution and companion to Flour Water Salt and Yeast,"Ten years since Ken Forkish revolutionized home baking by teaching us to make professional quality artisan breads in our home kitchens he has returned with a new book which promises to teach us how to make artisan pan breads which are great for sandwiches, and we delve into the world of ancient grains. This new book “fixes” one of the few complaints people had with Flour Water Salt & Yeast: that his method for sourdough starter wastes too much flour, and after two years of a pandemic that saw bare shelves in grocery stores, and a current war raging that threatens to upend the wheat supply for many parts of the world this is a worthy improvement. His new levain method just gets refreshed every 10 days or so leading to much less discard. A purist may prefer the FWS&Y method which precisely timed the starter to its peak flavor and leavening ability, but this new version will be a welcome change for most.<br /><br />Few books have changed home baking the way FWSY has. It has achieved legendary status. As the followup, companion, and in some ways successor to FWSY this book is a must read for anyone serious about making artisan quality breads at home.<br /><br />Summary of what’s new since FWSY:<br />1. new category of bread: artisan pan breads.<br />2. makes sourdough easier and flour efficient.<br />3. The flexibility to make two and sometimes three different breads from the same recipe, including 1. open-pan loaves, 2. lidded-pan loaves, and 3. Dutch-oven loaves.<br /><br />Recipes include:<br /><br />SAME DAY RECIPES:<br /><br />1. The standard<br />2. White bread<br />3. 50% Emmer or Einkorn bread<br />4. 50% Rye bread<br />5.

Action packed thriller.,"Lisa Scottoline knows how to tell a story. And this one especially piqued my interest because my husband is a court reporter and because we were originally from Philly. The plot, by now everyone knows, is multilayered. Carjacking gone wrong. And the first bird to half of the book is about how the Bennett handle grief, the WITSEC FBI program and organized crime. There were enough surprises to keep me guessing, but somewhere along the line, I felt like there were one too many twists and I anticipated a few moves. I can really see stuff like this happening, but I also felt there were some obvious character moves that, in a way, were disappointing. And whether Mr. Ordinary Guy Jason Bennett Court reporter could do some of the things he did, I’m not so sure. Was the end satisfying?  Was justice served?  The readers will have to make up their own minds. I thought that Bennet's characterization of good bad guys and bad good guys was pretty good. Life is definitely filled with both.",3.0,0,2022
Not a chance of making it thru,"Gave up at 13%. The constant F bombs were bad enough, but when she added pot smoking and ""getting off"" in the tub, it very much turned me off.

"We must master the unpleasant, instead of letting the unpleasant master us. ~ H. Addington Bruce","Yet this is what we must do if we want to make a real success of life. We must master the unpleasant, instead of letting the unpleasant master us. ~ H. Addington Bruce<br /><br />After encountering a disaster at Ramsgate, Fitzwilliam Darcy and his sister arrive at Netherfield Park seeking healing.<br /><br />A morning ride leads to a chance encounter:  Arrogant ladies he knew. Grasping ladies he knew. Disingenuous, simpering ladies he knew. An impertinent lady, however, was something of a novelty to a man of Darcy’s stature.<br /><br />Sometimes in tragedy, we find our life's purpose — the eye sheds a tear to find its focus. ~ Robert Brault<br /><br />An Assembly insult occurs; a much stronger Bingley marches his friend across the room to make amends.  A counter insult results in conversation.  Friendship begins.<br /><br />The love story proceeds rather easily.  Friendship between Elizabeth and Georgiana proceeds rather easily.  Healing proceeds but not always easily.<br /><br />Georgiana is emotionally damaged from her encounter with Wickham.  She is ashamed before her brother.  She is unable to connect with her cousin, the Colonel.  And Wickham threatens Darcy with his knowledge of Georgiana’s disgrace.<br /><br />Darcy suffers from his guilt:  not protecting his sister; choosing the wrong companion, and being unable to deal with Wickham’s blackmail.<br /><br />We carry our burden on and on, until one day, suddenly, we laugh and set it down upon the ground. ~ Muriel Strode<br /><br />Instead of a disastrous proposal at Hunsford, we get a loving and heartfelt proposal at Netherfield.  What could be better?<br /><br />The supporting characters are at their best:  a chance meeting between Georgiana and Elizabeth’s youngest sisters ends in a surprise; Bingley stands by his woman; and Hurst?  Well, this is Mr. Hurst:<br />Hurst took a long swallow from his glass and shrugged. “Colonel Forster likes a late night, and Bingley, as you know, is obliging. I doubt he will return before we retire.”<br />“And Mrs. Hurst?”<br />One corner of Hurst’s mouth lifted. “Upstairs consoling Caroline. My sister has barely left her rooms since she heard you are to marry Elizabeth Bennet. It has been the most relaxing day and a half I have spent indoors in the last month.”<br />“I am glad to be of service,” said Darcy drily.<br /><br />I always appreciate an author who makes me see the story and especially if I feel the story.  Case in point:  His voice was impenetrably grave. “Every morning at sunrise I walked to the shore. Even from the cliffs, the air smelt of salt and brine. The sea itself was never still. It was magnificent, hypnotic— a living, breathing entity impossible to contain. It could break a ship in half or drown a man in a matter of minutes. But there is more to the sea than its malicious beauty and intemperate nature. Beneath its cold surface, beneath its undulating waves, there is tranquillity and peace. Submerged, no idle thoughts disturbed my conscience. Not one soul imposed upon my peace. If not for Georgiana, if not for Pemberley, I could have remained in its embrace forever.”<br /><br />I loved the Austen quotes to begin each chapter!  A great little touch.<br /><br />My soul is like the oar that momently<br />Dies in a desperate stress beneath the wave,<br />Then glitters out again and sweeps the sea:<br />Each second I'm new-born from some new grave.<br />~ Sidney Lanier<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",5.0,1,2022
As if it had Two Authors - One Fabulous & One Dull,"I fell in love with this novel and can’t stop thinking about it.  So why three stars? It’s as if Rembrandt painted Polly and Agnes on a much larger canvas painted by an untalented  teen.  As long as the story focused on Polly and Agnes and their piece of Maine I was captivated.  They are drawn so sympathetically and fully that they continue to resonate with me weeks later.  The rest of the characters are hack jobs and their stories implausible stereotypes at best.  Maud is a loving single mom with a jerk of a married lover she struggles to leave but who is irrelevant to the entire story in plot and character development.  So why is he there? Robert, a townie,  who is implausibly accused of theft by wealthy summer people, is even more implausibly convicted - by other locals! And then this supposed gentle man convicted of a non-violent crime is sent to a maximum security prison and spends time in solitary confinement? Not only nonsense but these details are irrelevant to plot, character, and theme. The forced improbable plot twists are just more of the same.  But Polly and Agnes! I want more of their story.  I want to meet them again without all the pop fiction nonsense. I challenge the author to lean into her real talent of characterization and follow the path hinted by Agnes.  How about a Franklin Square Girls focused on Agnes and Polly?",3.0,0,2022
Couldn't slog through it,"I read Jean Hanff Korelitz's book, Admission, years ago and liked it. I thought the brief blurbs for The Latecomer sounded promising as did the NYT's review. So, I bought the book. I couldn't get past the first section. It's just a narrator regurgitating the parents' history. It's flat. It's boring. It's pretentious.

Disappointing,"I have been a Baldacci fan for years. John Puller, the Camel Club, Amos Decker, Will Robie.... series after series I have thoroughly enjoyed of his. I was really disappointed when I read the first Atlee Pine book. It was unlike what I was accustomed to from Baldacci and I won't read any more of that series. But I figure there is always a stinker in the bunch. I was very excited about The 6:20 Man by the blurb I read. But it has taken me forever to read this one book. I can't get interested in any of it. It is lackluster, boring, contrived and not anything like the Baldacci series that have come before it.<br /><br />There is nothing about The 6:20 Man that speaks to being a Baldacci. Everything, from the premise to details just wreaked of inexperience. If I had been tasked with reading The 6:20 Man without knowing who wrote it I would have assumed this was the first work from an unknown writer who was just taking a stab at writing a thriller. This storyline bounced around a lot, it is cluttered with needless characters and semi plots. There are too many possible ""bad guys"" with no motives. There are too many repetitious sections that seem to be there only to draw out the length of the book, not enough foundation to be invested in Travis Devine (or any character in this book for that matter) and it seems the writer knows nothing about the military, espionage, the world of finance, I.T., or writing. It is choppy from start to finish. I finished this book to see if it got better, but it did not. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I am not sure who really wrote The 6:20 Man, but I wish David Baldacci would come back and write something as thrilling as his older series.",1.0,0,2022
4.5 Stars,"I don’t normally like to write reviews on a series until I’ve finished it. This time I want to record my rating so I’ll remember how much I liked this book. I completely devoured it in one sitting. It doesn’t even feel like it took me long to read, a few hours maybe?<br /><br />The story is really compelling and the world building was so well done. FMC (Sadie) has good character development and a good backstory. None of the males have much of a backstory yet, but I think that’s by design. We shall see.<br /><br />It’s weird that the prophecy in this book isn’t about any of the main characters. It’s like they’re supposed to be side characters in another’s story. Kinda strange, but an interesting twist; I’m interested to see where the author takes this.<br /><br />Major cliffhanger ending!<br /><br />- Reverse harem<br />- 3 shifter in possible harem<br />- MM, this is gonna turn out to be more polyamory and less RH<br />- sexual tension, but no relationship between FMC and the guys yet<br />- low steam<br />- slow burn<br />- trigger: major betrayal, enemies to lovers, FMC is bullied by prospective harem, past and current abuse, kidnapping, torture",4.0,1,2022

Highlander Defied: one of my least favorite books by this author,"There was so much I didn't like in this book.  The hero was so flawed, there was nothing to like. At 72%, I was still waiting for something good to happen. Got so very tired of the revenge talk. He was single-minded to ""get even/get them back/kill a Gunn."" Too much sex; I skipped that. The war and loss of life was just stupid. Let's kill 200 men in a war that didn't never needed to happen. The hero took advice from a stranger on where to go to battle. Really? Hero is not only unlikeable, he's dumb.  Let's throw a man in a cave-cage-cell and let him freeze. But we show humanity by wiping the blood from his wound. Where is the caring with these characters? The sister's fight at end was silly. I finished the book but can't find anything here to recommend. This author has much better books! She's a wonderful writer (usually). I also read her books under other pseudonyms including Amanda Quick.  Started reading her in the 80s so even though I hated this book, I recommend this author.",1.0,0,2022
The Devil is in the Details,"Author Richard White has written a most meticulously researched book on the death of Stanford University co-founder Jane Stanford, as evidenced by White's 59 pages of footnotes in the bibliography. Ironically, the research that makes the book remarkable would be the same quality that might deter all readers except those who have keen interests in the history of the university or family named Stanford.  As much as I was tempted just to skip over to the end of the book to find out who killed Mrs. Stanford, why, and why was it never solved, I didn't.  White built a very compelling case for the guilty parties, by the way.  I am totally convinced by his hypothesis.  Along the way to his reveal, I learned many things about the time period. I never knew Stanford was named after a young boy who died as a teenager or that his mother ruled the early years of the institution, wielding even more authority than the university president. The two battled over such issues as whether or not the university should be coed, with Stanford thinking the women were too distracting for the young men. White draws many parallels between social conditions of the late 1890s and the 2020s, particularly when it comes to ever-widening disparities in levels of wealth. This is a worthwhile read, but before readers start, they should be sure that they are as fond of history as they are of mystery.",3.0,0,2022
"Main character needs to meet a gelding knife, a swift kick to the behind, and a lobotomy.","This is another book I read recently where I ended up hating the main character.  I can't quite get an understanding of why authors insist on creating leading characters who are so unheroic.  I understand that the idea of having an anti-hero as a main character has some appeal, but its only the truly talented authors who can make that kind of character work, and I know of quite a few professional authors who won't put one into a story due to the care that should be taken with that kind of character.<br /><br />But this story has a main character who spends half his time thinking about getting girls into bed, half his time hating his family and any wizard with more power than him (most of them) and half of his time worrying about money.  Add in all the time he spends getting into fights because he isn't paying attention to the world around him and you have a character, I actively wanted to see fed to the incubus he just happened to run into and then run away from.<br /><br />The overall writing is actually quite good, and the world the author imagined is full of promise.  I could see this being a fun world to read about, but I disliked the main character enough that it ruined my enjoyment overall.  Still I can say that I don't think everyone will have the same reaction I did.  Mine is strongly based in my bias against anti-hero characters and wishing for a main character who could think about something other than sex (and was far less angsty.)<br /><br />So this is another low 3 star.  I won't recommend, but I'm not going to say that no one will like it either.",3.0,0,2022
Issues,"You would expect a book on filled cupcakes to have an introductory small chapter on the various methods for filling cupcakes, but this doesn't.  Instead I read in the first cupcake recipe she removes the center with a spoon, fills the cupcake with the spoon, doesn't recover the hole with a slice of the cake that was removed, then just adds buttercream over this to disguise the hole.  Is she going to repeat that in every single recipe?  If I wasn't interested in the first recipe would I even have seen this method?  There are other methods that don't seem to be mentioned, like a dedicated cupcake injector made by Norpro and others, and a special piping bag tip that does the same thing.  No mention that I can see.<br /><br />Then I skipped to the back and the index isn't clickable.

"Love the book, but CONTINUITY MISTAKES","I LOVED THE STORY! But OMG!!! If an editor can’t catch the difference between a fortnight versus a week they need to be fired.  The back and forth timeline errors in this book distracted me! I guess no one, except me, cares if continuity issues killed the book, but I do. I’m not talking about comma or punctuation edits, I’m talking about a character who in one chapter states they have been at a place for two days and then in the next recollection, it’s less than twenty four hours. It’s night in one paragraph then the heroine is thinking about taking a mid day rest later on in the same scene. ARGH!!! WHY employe an editor if they don’t freaking catch mistakes. I know the book has tons of glowing reviews I guess no one cares about editing failures messing up the story for some of us. Geez I wish all these mediocre editors would learn how to read a freaking manuscript in it’s completed form then edit. I am getting tired of all these people who call themselves editors, charge authors for work, and miss issues. A character even changes names Daria become Dalia.  I over look some continuity errors, but when they are numerous I have to rate down the book. Hint hint editors read the freaking book, and remember the book’s plot.<br />I read it via kindle unlimited, so I didn’t outright pay for the book; but I am pissed on behalf of the author who trusted an editor that puts out such poor work.

Favorite book in years,"Update: I finally finished it (quite a feat for me without an audiobook) and it's my favorite book I've read or listened to in several years. I love all 3 POV characters, even the morally questionable one I can passionately empathize with. And the eponymous ""Last Stand"" is a riveting climax that is delightfully different than the chaotic violence with which most fantasy stories reach their crescendo. I cannot wait for the next one. I really liked her dragon and DFZ books, but this one puts Rachel Aaron on the short list of my very favorite modern authors.<br /><br />I have not finished this as I am mainly an audiobook person, don't have a lot of time to ""read"" books, but I loved the concept of this so much I couldn't wait for the audiobook. I just wanted to say I love the writing style, especially for Mary...it genuinely makes me feel like I'm experiencing the events through the lens of unique and believable person. It's very easy to mess up the POV of a historical character from a different culture, and while I cannot speak to the literal authenticity, it feels right and I can't wait to experience more of the story from Mary's POV.<br /><br />ALSO I LOVE CRYSTALS AND UNDERGROUND MYSTERIES AND THEY SING THAT'S AMAZING AHH",5.0,1,2022

Superior race and all that. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Nettleton and others like it were society's attempt to keep those deemed intellectually, physically, or morally deficient from having children. After all, we don't need them expecting hand outs from the government, birthing a brood of more moochers. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Homes for unwed mothers, sanitoriums, asylums for the ""feeble minded"", reform schools; all institutions that, on the surface,  have our best interests at heart but whose intentions are often distorted and mangled by those trying to control what isn't rightfully theirs to control  or trying to mitigate their own wrongdoing.<br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />The main character, Mary Engle, a young, naive Catholic girl takes her first job at Nettleton. She worships Margaret Sanger, the woman at the helm. Questions arise when she sees a girl from the same orphanage where she was raised, a girl who didn't seem ""feeble minded"" in the least.  I couldn't help it, I judged Mary Engle harshly. I wanted to slap her and yell in her face, ""Wake up!.""  But it wasn't her fault;  it was the culture of the time (behave appropriately, respect authority, don't question).<br /><br />All of the women at Nettleton were institutionalized against their will for the duration of their child-bearing years. They were essentially free labor for the institutions and the people with money and influence in the community.  Many women were sent away by their parents or husbands because of their refusal to do as told or because they dared to speak about emotional,  physical, and/or sexual abuse. Sometimes it was a means of controlling her money without the nuisance of having her around.  The eugenics movement certainly wasn't the first nor the last example of the blaming the victim mentally still evident today. Every story deserves to be heard but I have to admit that at times I feel the weight will crush me.<br /><br />What makes The Foundling particularly poignant is that it is based on the true story of Leary's grandmother (not great-grandmother or great-great-grandmother). The book is well researched and rings true.  I  would like to have more information about what happened to the women after they were released. It couldn't have been good.<br /><br />The question that needs pondering is this: When we are witness to injustice, when our eyes are opened, will we have the courage to act?<br /><br />I received a drc from Scribner via Netgalley.<br />Available now.",4.0,1,2022
"quick read, nice intro to penny pinching, reminder to not live above means, be smart","I enjoyed this. I watch her channel, and although I dont agree or get with all of it, I can appreciate her authentic passion for how she lives. There are things I wish I did way earlier in life, but there are things I am doing now that are making a huge impact. As much as we are different, we have a slew of similarities. I simply enjoy her info and do with it as I see fit. As for the book, it is brief (49 pages). It can make for a nice starting off point if new to trying to save money, or are curious to know more about her. Or if you want someone (your teen, 20 something) to have a nice intro on pinching pennies.<br /><br />If you already watch her channel, then you likely wont learn anything new, exactly. But if you watch her channel, why not support her by buying this? I really think she could expand on everything and really make this a must have book. I hope she continues to publish.",5.0,1,2022
this reminds me of several other “fae queen selection” novels,"I’m an avid reader of romance and fantasy genre fiction. This story reminds me of several other “fae queen selection” novels. To the point I actually had to go back in my history to be sure I Haven’t already read this. Our main FL is a down and out bartender with a mysterious past and an axe to grind against pretty rich boys who take advantage of her. Our fae king ML is a blond god of manhood with a dark secret who can not love or the one he loves dies. All in all this was entertaining and a very quick read. I’m sad it wasn’t longer, and the selection process more detailed. While predictable, it is well edited and the characters have distinct voices. I hope the next novel brings more detail and slower pacing. I would love to see more of the fae realm explained and with enough detail to see it clearly.",4.0,1,2022
Riveting and thought provoking,"I initially hesitated to read this book -- erronously -- assuming I pretty much already knew what it would tell me (having read and loved the authors' previous three books). Far from it! This book presents the complex and important subject of agricultural practices and soil & human health with the latest in-depth evidence and factual research, including the scientific insights and recommended good practices. Every chapter provides mind boggling a-ha! moments and fascinating information, gathered meticulously from reliable sources. Highly recommended for all who eat food.",5.0,1,2022
Unsure,"I was intrigued by the idea behind this story, but I'm not sure if I really liked it.<br /><br />There were parts I enjoyed. Like the competition idea (even as ruthless as it was). I also liked the genuine friendship between Poppy and Joanna.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed by the authors lack of follow through on their promises. WHY is everything so VAGUE!!! Give me some details, STOP TELLING ME and SHOW ME for goodness sake!!<br />-During the weeks in this book the girls have classes. We are never actually seeing these classes. We had a brief glimpse of art.. paint something telling us who you are. Another at ""combat"", all the betas attack Poppy to make her fight back, then nothing. Exercise was shown, where they run and then Vivian punishes Poppy with extra exercise.<br />-Poppy said the city was big and beautiful. Where is the descriptions?<br />-Gowns are always described in color only, maybe some detail about a v neck, or collar. Where are the details?! Are they made of silk? Overlaid with lace? Is there beadwork? Embroidered flowers? We don't know a thing except, it's long and black/blue/whatever.<br />-where is this ""pack life""? Instead of shifters I have literally been imagining these people as vikings. Come, kill, conquer, mate, repeat.<br /><br />What is the point of having Willow mentioned every other page if no one really CARES? Poppy only ever mentions her when she sees Anders, but she was the ""other half of your soul"". Not believable. I wanted to be mad at all the other people in this book for giving her such little consideration for her loss but it's kind of hard when the twin doesn't even seem that heartbroken.<br /><br />I am not a fan of how the blatant r@pe is being whitewashed by everyone as just a part of life.<br /><br />I am 98% NOT a fan of Ryne. He is a scared little boy playing a man's game. He doesn't even have the gumption to stand against things he KNOWS are wrong. Then he makes this HUGE deal to Poppy that he never forces women he beds, but admits to visiting the mating houses. In what reality do you use a sex slave but are not r@ping them? Can they say no? No, they can't!  Just because you don't physically force them doesn't mean it's consent. (I'm actually a fan of reading non-con but be HONEST about what's really going on here!) Also he kissed (actually more like made out with) at least TWO different women, but has the nerve to get butt hurt that Poppy doesn't just fall at his feet when he openly speaks about her becoming a Beta wife. I wouldn't have begged here either!<br /><br />I think I'll read book 2 because it does have me curious.. but I REALLY hope the writing gets better going forward.",3.0,0,2022
Unreadable,"I can't say much about the content. As the font is so small it's unreadable. Instead of formatting it for a kindle. it's formatted for a wide page book. Doesn't fit on a phone, tablet or kindle. The pages are much wider then tall. If you hold your tablet vertical you're stuck scrolling back and forth to read a sentence. When held horizontal you have to scroll up and down.  That's a real nice pear in that picture, hold on I can only see a third of if let me scroll. If your wondering the really nice pictures interfere with our ability to zoom in and out. Don't stop you from doing it but they sure do get in the way when I all I want to do is read the dam text.

Reverse Hallmark Movie Ending Follows Laugh out Loud Humor,"This charming book by Emily Henry has an acknowledged shout out to Hallmark Movies, first in character by the thoughts of protagonist Nora and later by author Emily Henry in the Reader's Guide. But this novel has some characters and an ending that are the reverse of the Hallmark formula.<br /><br />Nora is the uptight literary agent who lives in New York and can't keep a boyfriend. She has never abandoned the protective role for her sister Libby that began when their mother died, even though her sister is an adult with a family of her own. When trying to sell a book by one of her favorite new authors named Dusty, Nora meets an irascible, sarcastic book editor named Charlie who dismisses the book and its setting as rubbish.  The book goes on to be a best seller.  Nora feels quite vindicated.<br /><br />Libby surprises Nora with a three-week sisters' vacation in Sunshine Falls (closest airport Asheville), North Carolina, that was the setting for Dusty's hit book, ""Once in a Lifetime."" Nora does not want to give up her busy work schedule, but her pregnant sister seems so insistent that Nora relents.  Who should they encounter there but the cynical Charlie, who should eat some crow about the success of the book by Dusty, but he really doesn't ever admit he might have been wrong.  However, he and Nora end up co-editing Dusty's next book, which turns out to be based on Nora herself, but using a fictitious name.  Nora is stunned by the way others see her, as a hard-as-nails businesswoman with less heart than brains and ambition, especially since Dusty is one of her favorite clients.  Charlie relishes Nora's shock and shame, but the two turn out to be compatible as co-editors.  Nora is stunned to learn that Charlie's hometown is Sunshine Falls, which explains why she encounters him in such an unexpected place, far away from his New York editing job.<br /><br />Surprises continually follow that reveal. I recommend this book with two cautions.  If you cannot tolerate frequent use of the F word in casual conversations or several graphic descriptions of sexual encounters, you might not like this book.  But if you can abide those characteristics, you will be rewarded with many laugh-out-loud situations and a happy, but reverse Hallmark Christmas Movie ending.",5.0,1,2022

Easy and powerful,"I am paradoxically both a skeptic and an eager seeker of magick and extraordinary phenomena but it's hard to convince me. I tried this book a few times. I have studiously avoided the rituals that use demons - call me superstitious but I grew up Catholic so the fear of demons is hard to shake. I tried a ritual to increase my income that was really almost desperate since where I work we've been having austerities due to COVID and others and for years now we do not get raises or barely just under standard of living. I thought that the likelihood of my getting a ""substantial raise"" as I requested was next to nil. Okay, laugh: soon after the ritual it was announced that a flat 5k raise would be given to all employees (I work for the government). After months of waiting with baited breath to see if the governer would approve it- it passed! Coincidence? Or did I just get a raise not just for myself but for all my colleagues, too?  I'll never know, but one thing is for sure, I'll do it again next year. I did two more, for ""belonging"" - one for my relatives on a specific event, and it worked, and another for getting along better with colleagues at work, which also seems to be working, so far. I cannot say whether the protection one worked or not because I don't know what I was spared, but if I were to guess, I'd say it worked. So, hey, here is something you can use that helps.",5.0,1,2022
I Loved This And Wish I Could’ve Given 4.5 Stars,"Let me start by saying , I typically read a few of the best reviews, followed by the worst reviews.<br />I was most surprised by those most critical, and don’t understand how so many in that group stated confusion and felt there was no point to the separate characters and their stories. They mentioned they had trouble finding a cohesive theme.<br />This makes me think they’re not familiar with folklore, or even fantasy, for that matter. I also find it hard to believe they actually gave the book a chance, or even finished it for that matter. But than again, we all have different ways of digesting what we read, and a preference to written style and formatting.<br />I did end up having to use the X-ray feature on Kindle for a few of the characters that had been mentioned early on, or further back. More from it being so face paced, and not so much from confusion.<br /><br />I also reserve 5 star reviews for those one of a kind, never forgotten novels. Those are rare. This one came very very close!<br /><br />By the end of the book, I was truly rooting for the ragtag, dysfunctional team, that had more or less formed their own unconventional “family,”  versus the “nuclear family”, which has become rarer in today’s day and age. The old adage of not being able to pick your family, but being able to pick your closest friends no longer holds true. But, I digress.<br /><br />Some of what happened, especially by the end, was more or less predictable, but there was a few things that were unanticipated. Neither good nor bad on either point. I kind of have a feeling as to where the next book in the series will head though. Without providing spoilers, I will say the antagonist caught me off guard, even though I had a few in mind I thought it may end up being. Nope!<br /><br />In all my reading of fantasy and folklore I had absolutely no clue about the Arne-Thompson Index! Wow! I did further research on this and was briefly educated on what an amazing body of work this is, and I look forward to actually reading more on it. I would think this is a goldmine for those in this particular genre, and maybe it is. Maybe it’s a well-kept secret for a reason. Lol The amount of work, ideas, and plotting, which could be had from this could be invaluable.<br /><br />I must add the fact that I was so stunned to actually enjoy this book so greatly, it took me a few days to even rate and review the book.<br />I had this in my Kindle Unlimited library for longer than I ordinarily do, before attempting to read this. I almost returned it a few times to clear up a few spots, since my capacity is usually at max in my Unlimited. The cover of the book kept throwing me off, and it was only due to the description of the book, that made me hold off, and than eventually begin to read it. Im so glad I kept holding out and my reservations proved to be for the best!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND for those into the<br />folklore/fantasy genre, as well as many others!!<br /><br />On a side note, I wish more of her books were available through the Unlimited feature of Kindle.",4.0,1,2022
It’s been a long time….,"It’s been a long time since I read a historical romance that actually made feel something wonderful.  This was a wonderful story with wonderful characters.  It’s not a violent, triple X, angst driven story. But it is a story with depth, feeling and ultimately the HEA that we all want in our romance novels.<br />This is a classic romance.

I didn't like Ashbee at all,"Vlad Kahany is a new author to me. I usually enjoy romances written by men and there were parts of this book that kept me reading, but it is erotica and the story got lost in that.<br /><br />The blurb clearly says that that Raymond Ashbee is a hedonist and that this is a sensual story, so I was warned. What I wasn't counting on was never liking him. Not even one time. He's jaded, cynical, wicked, selfish, condescending, domineering...I found no redeeming qualities in him at all. He spends a lot of time and money at the Belle House, an upscale brothel, and even takes his nephew there to corrupt him and get him to see things Raymond's way. Walter was pathetic and wasn't in the story all that long, thank God. If only that was the worst thing Raymond did.<br /><br />May was in hiding at the Belle House for some reason I was never clear on. She wasn't a working girl and is pretty isolated. Her only friends are the maid and a little girl. I felt bad for her until she decided to go play voyeur with the maid and then got busted by Lord Ashbee and ended up with him. A virgin with a self-centered hedonist who was determined to make her one, too made for some sordid scenes. I thought she got stupid when she started out as a promising character.<br /><br />I have nothing against steam in novels. This isn't Little House on the Prairie, after all, but some of this was gratuitous and over the top. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, mostly because of vague character descriptions and the fact that I didn't like them. I didn't feel them falling in love and even at the end, I wasn't convinced either of them was truly happy.<br /><br />Throw in the grisly bear-baiting scene that really blew my mind and not in a good way, a few instances of wrong word usage, and unlikable secondary characters as well as the salaciousness of Ashbee and May, and you have the reasons why I gave this three stars.<br /><br />Many will like this book. I didn't hate it, but probably won't continue reading the series.",3.0,0,2022
Unique and helpful even for the experienced!,"I have a few other dehydrating manuals and have been dehydrating for many years but I always love to read newer books for inspiration. Even so, I wasn't certain that I'd find much that was new to me in a dehydrating cookbook that was targeted to beginners. Boy was I wrong! Chris talks about the basics and covers them all well, so a newbie won't feel overwhelmed at all. However, there are also unique meal, snack, and even jerky recipes that I've marked to try. She also covers dehydrating herbs and other specialty items - I can't wait to try dates to make date sugar!<br /><br />One other thing to note - I actually own a freeze dryer and while the resulting product is great, using the machine has its own kind of drama. Dehydrators are blessedly simple to use, clean, and maintain. And they're not nearly the energy-suckers that freeze dryers are! Do yourself a favor and get this book so you can really learn how to dehydrate well. You'll most likely discover that it will be your favorite way to preserve food.<br /><br />*I was gifted an advance copy for review but this is no way influenced my review - these are the actual thoughts that I thunk!",5.0,1,2022
Not enthralling,"Lucy is a character from an earlier novel, updated here in the early days of Covid. Lucy has been widowed for two years when her ex-husband, William, currently divorced, sweeps her up and whisks her off to Maine, to an isolated beach house where they can safely ride out the pandemic. As foggy-brained and confused as ever, Lucy goes with him. As she relates the often-mundane elements of her days in a stream-of-consciousness fashion, we learn of her abusive childhood, her lack of confidence, and her negativity. I enjoyed the portrayal of the early days of the pandemic, although troubling to remember, it was realistic in the details and has historical value.<br /><br />However, this novel was quite tedious. Strout gives us epilogue scenes from earlier novels, and I'm not sure those had value, nor did the creepy negativity of Lucy's new novel with a character (a policeman named Arms) breaking the spine of another character (a young man named Sperm), and then caring for him for life.<br /><br />There is one scene toward the end of the book where Lucy emerges from her somnambulist ways to give her sad adult daughter some really good, inspiring advice, but then Lucy goes back to sleep. The excellent question her daughters ask, whether her unlikeable ex (their father) is manipulating her for his own needs, goes not only unanswered, but the novel ends in a Stockholm Syndrome-type vignette.<br /><br />I found this novel, and the writing style, unsatisfying. I'm not sure if Strout was feeling experimental or lazy with this work, but either way, the dissatisfaction I had with her previous novel, ""Oh, William,"" continues. At this point, I'm sorry to say I don't think I'm a Strout fan anymore.",3.0,0,2022

First time there's something wrong here.,"I have read every book Suzanne has Ever written.  Her books are so full of humor, action, suspense, love & more.  Usually the only thing that would bother me is when they'd end. Haha. However, for the first time, there is one other thing.<br /><br />In the story:  Luke finally has the chance to claim his mate, Blair.  But between someone pursuing Blair & another issue in town, things are getting dangerous & confusing.  I don't want to give much detail, especially seems you can read the synopsis. You'll appreciate the story more.<br /><br />Normally you can pretty much figure out who the ""bad guy"" is.  But this time Suzanne did a Fantastic job of keeping us guessing up until the end.  The humor was, as usual, top notch. I especially always love Alex's 3 Uncles!  Plus when Bailey came on the scene, laughs increased.  Now with Blair in the mix of things with her ""special talent"", there's definitely more humor.  There's more than 1 issue going on and that also makes for a great read.  But, sadly, the one negative that I just couldn't overlook is the constant repeat of thoughts.  There is So much that I literally skipped paragraphs!  I even went back a couple times to see if skipping would make me miss any key points. Nope.  You'll read & re-read how important Luke & Blair feel toward each other, why they may hold things back, how they can't be without each other, how they were before etc.  Once or twice doing this is not a big deal. But, unfortunately, you could probably skip 1/8 or so of this story and it wouldn't matter too much.  This is a tragedy because Suzanne writes awesome stories and this makes you stop reading, roll your eyes, and look for an area where there's talking. You can pretty much figure out if you skipped anything key with what's ""said"" in the next line.<br /><br />However, overall, I STILL recommend this read. Like I said, it's got great humor, loads of action, suspense & a good story!  This could be a stand alone.  But honestly, I'd recommend reading the other 3 books in series. You'll know more about the other characters.<br /><br />Happy reading!",3.0,0,2022

The Unbreakable Bond Between a Man and His Cat,"Author Hiro Arikawa captures the depths of a bond that can be formed between a human and his pet, in this case between a young man named Satoru and his cat named Nana.  Their relationship has a happenstance beginning, as the cat is a stray that uses Satoru's silver van as a refuge from the weather, sunning on top during the day and hiding underneath in rain.  When Satoru notices the cat, he begins to leave food scraps out for him.  This arrangement continues for a while, until the cat is hit by a car and suffers a broken leg.  He crawls to Satoru's door and meows for his very life.  After an indoor convalescent period, a decision must be made. Satoru lives in an apartment that does not allow pets.  Much of the story is told from the point of view of the cat, who thinks in and can understand human language, but cannot speak.  His thoughts are humorous and quite sardonic, bringing many laugh-out-loud moments to this reader. Once the cat consents to be adopted, Satoru gives him the name of Nana because the shape of his tail resembles the Japanese word for the number seven<br /><br />Satoru is a very kind person, but he has seen his share of sorrows.  His parents were killed in a car wreck when he was in his teens, and he had to go live with an aunt who would not let him bring the previous cat he so dearly loved.  That cat went to live with distant relatives and died before Satoru could visit him. Just when Nana and Satoru were settling in together, Satoru announced they must go on a trip and that he would be looking for a new owner for Nana.  He didn't give a reason, but at this point fairly early in the book, the journeys began, as Satoru sought one home after another for his beloved feline friend.  At each stop along the way, where Satoru would be visiting close friends from the many different schools he had attended, Nana would misbehave so that the potential owners would reject him.  After several failed tries, Satoru heads to his aunt's house, where it is determined both man and cat shall live.<br /><br />Arikawa's descriptions of the magnificent journey through Japan are breath-taking.  It made me want to see Mount Fuji in person.  Nana enjoys the walks through magnificent flowers and fields, but is very scared of the ocean for its noise and irregular and powerful movements. Eventually the sad reason Satoru tried to give Nana away is revealed and some very poignant passages follow.  It was a tearjerker for me, but a wonderful book.  I'm an adult reader, but I can recommend this book for young adults because there is no bad language, the story flashes back to school days of Satoru and his friends, and kids love their pets.",5.0,1,2022
Scifi AND Literature,"Science fiction has a problem - poor writing.  I'm not talking about those free Kindle ""novels"" by wannabe authors filled with bad spelling, grammar, punctuation, characters and dialogue (and inexplicably getting majority five stars).  I'm talking about real writers who dare to write a stand alone story - an increasingly rare event today.  This is, above all, a work of literature - expressive, funny, poetic, sophisticated, witty and mesmerizing.<br /><br />Combining different timelines is certainly not original but rarely has it been handled with such panache. The use of period language alone was a tour de force.  Almost imperceptibly the reader realizes that things are not all they seem and begins to question the nature of reality.  Of course the solution is inventive and satisfying but getting there is half the fun.  The journey was as agreeable as the destination.<br /><br />You have to love Silas and Ada, their repartee that changes over time, but every character is unique - the young genius mathematician, the Russian ""Master"", the Captain and the ever changing Mexican.  As the iterations begin to bleed into one another, Ada desperately attempts to convince Silas of the devastating truth, something he refuses to accept.

so different in a good way,"Set in the small fictional town of Everton, New Hampshire, Unlikely Animals was a unique, almost whimsical kind of story, where even the dearly departed buried at the Maple Street Cemetery get to have their say about the residents still living in their town. It is a story of a family in crisis and it is also a story about how the opioid crisis has impacted small town life.<br /><br />Emma Starling was believed to be born with the gift of healing.  At 22 she drops out of medical school (at least that's her version of the story) to return home to help care for her dying father, Clive.  Clive was forced into retirement as a result of a rare brain disorder that resulted in hallucinations.  Clive sees animals that only he seems to see.  He has even made friends with the ghost of a NH naturalist, Ernest Harold Baynes, a man known for his love and compassion to the gentle creatures who called the woods surrounding his property home.  Clive is also all consumed with helping to find Emma's former best friend, Crystal Nash.<br /><br />In this story the characters are flawed and animals play a significant part in this novel.  The story is a bit slow moving but, trust me, it is slow and deliberate in the best kind of way. Emma was a well-crafted character and my heart went out to her at times. Her life wasn't turning out anything like she had thought. She'd gone from medical school to a caregiver and long term substitute teacher for fifth graders in town. Clive was also a character I grew to care about even when I didn't expect to as I learned about his past. There were some touching moments in this story and I loved the ending and learning about the author's inspiration for this story as well.  Very enjoyable.  If you are in the mood for something totally different, this just may be the book for you.<br /><br />RATING - 4.5/5 stars",5.0,1,2022
Not super,"I really enjoyed the other books in this series and looked forward to this one being the ending. Instead this book is overstuffed with stories better suited for novellas, as they distract from the main story and have little to no importance. I didn’t understand why the “novella material” was included until I got to the end of the ridiculously long book and was met with a cliffhanger. Author has turned this series from great into an okay-money-making type of series. So. Disappointed.",2.0,0,2022

"A Story Well Told, A Life Not Understood","Yes, she can write. I think, however, it's quit apparent that for most of her life she had no idea where her boundaries were and I rather doubt that it was possible for anyone else to know. Early on she understood that her was body was power and currency of a certain kind. What she does not appear to have come to until quite late is what that power was, the circumscriptions on it and just what she was willing to sell and what the terms would be. Consider that she's OK with some theft (squatting in houses) but not OK with shoplifting. She's OK with selling her image but displeased with some of the terms. She dissociates to get through her experiences but CHOOSES those experiences again and again and again. She is pleased with the reaction that she uses her appearance to get but displeased that she is judged only on her appearance. I'm not sure that even now there is any coherent Emily - I would hope at some point she sets her own boundaries and makes her own choices in a way that feels like one person.",3.0,0,2022
Storytelling is about two things: it’s about character and plot. ~ George Lucas,"What a unique plot!  And I say unique, despite its beginning similarity to another book, which at this time is still an unfinished series.<br /><br />This story, however, is fully developed and complete. Elizabeth Bennet is the second born of a set of twins.  Her brother did not survive, and the girl baby is raised as a boy.<br /><br />Obviously, as the child grows, she will develop as a female, so the Bennets are forced to adjust their family situation.  That adjustment radically changes the life of Elizabeth Bennet!<br /><br />Proofread carefully to see if you any words out. ~ Author unknown<br /><br />A Proofreader! A Proofreader!  My Kingdom for a Proofreader!<br /><br />If there were not so many errors scattered throughout the book, I would give this 5-Stars.  I really wanted to reward this strong plot, but I cannot.<br />Words are left out<br />Words are added in<br />The wrong word is used<br />Georgiana is sometimes Georgina<br />Lady Catherine de Bourgh is sometimes de Bourg.<br />Et cetera; et cetera; et cetera!<br /><br />I could have used some warning between scene changes.  We are at Longbourn with the Bennets, then, in the next paragraph, we are at Netherfield or in London with Darcy.  This is especially true in the Epilogue which tries to wrap up every character. Readers need a break — literally.<br /><br />Please, author, get an editor!<br /><br />The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter — it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. ~ Mark Twain",4.0,1,2022
Friendly Enemies,"I'm a slow moving narrative the reader learns of a husband who is cheating on his wife while trying to make her believe that she is crazy. Edith is a young wife who has already been through finding out that her husband was cheating. A year has passed since that evangelism she becomes suspicious. The adventure of her trying to prove that he either is or is not guilty forms the plot of this novel. Fortunately, she has a good friend who helps her. She becomes absolutely I'll with indecision and remorse as he continues to protest his innocence. The height of the story precedes the ending which will blow you away. While the plot is a good one, it differs from repetitive scenes of her indecision and his denials with lots of tears. There is inadequate character development and the ending has no connection to the plot but is very fitting. If you like mystery-solving, this is for you.",3.0,0,2022
Not What I Was Hoping For,"I really loved the first book in this series. It was funny and complex and smexy. LOVED the cover art and the concept, like absolutely awesome! I couldn’t wait for book two.<br /><br />Cue the sad trumpets, waa waa…<br /><br />The premise for book two is that the girl agrees to a match on her dating app without seeing the face of her suitor. She tries to reject the match after finding out he’s her version of Quasimodo and triggers a clause that involves some pretty heinous punishments. The story drops you in at a weird point in the story. We don’t get to see her hope when the match comes in or her reaction to the match when she sees her alien. It’s just straight to the beginning of the bad stuff. Okay. I figure, let’s do this.<br /><br />Right off the bat there are repeated duped and swapped words. The editing is messy and needs another read through by a fresh set of eyes to fix. I’m thinking this was released in a rush. The action is okay in the beginning, but we really aren’t given a reason to like the hero. In fact, all through the story, literally to the last page, he keeps making these insulting assumptions about Ebony and her motivations. He’s strong and aggressive, but he isn’t an alpha. Broken hero with trust issues, low self-esteem and an anger problem.<br /><br />The worst part of the story though is the bad guys. These are your classic, bwah-ha-ha-villain-laugh absolute horror shows of evil, worst things you can imagine (no, I mean it so mind the triggers) and there is no point. There tries to be a point, but it is so flimsy that I can’t buy it.<br /><br />So we have these one dimensional bad guys and a deus essex machina ending that was soooo predictable. Just honestly made me mad from beginning to end because I KNOW this writer can do better.<br /><br />I gave this story one star for the cool cover art, one star for the idea of an alien dating app, and one star for finishing the manuscript.",3.0,0,2022
Excellent book!,"The author really picks some great topics for children in her books. This is one topic I think that is important about body boundaries.<br /><br />Not every child wants to be hugged, or tickled! Nick has a friend who likes to tickle him! He also has an aunt who likes to hug and kiss him!<br /><br />Touch isn’t always comfortable for all children. Touch isn’t always good either. This book explores Nick’s personal feelings about touch like too much tickling. This book also discusses about bad touch in private areas of the body.<br /><br />There is some good role modeling  with the different situations and how Nick can respond. His parents are willing to help him problem solve. His aunt was very respectful when he let her know how he felt about being hugged and kissed a lot!<br /><br />I like the illustrations in the story. They go along with the written storyline. The bubble around Nick shows visually a real bubble was very good.<br /><br />I also like the idea of a safety team. Trusted adults that a child can go to to talk about how they are feeling or bring up any concerns. A sensitively written book and I highly recommend it.",5.0,1,2022
This is a fantasy story NOT TO BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE BIBLICAL COMMENTARY!!!!!!,"1.<br />I’m going to put a warning label on this book, if you’re unfamiliar with the Bible, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!<br />2.<br />As for the reason this author started writing these books, his friend said King David was a mess. He was a mess! But he was also a man after God’s heart. The point of the story of David in the Bible is to show us we should yearn after God, seek Him in all we do, if we do mess up we will be forgiven because we serve a loving God. Does that mean we should go out and purposely mess up? No! But there’s a lesson to learn from David!!!<br />3.<br />This story uses Scripture from Psalms and Proverbs as well as Genesis, but the Scripture is few and far between, there are also instances which the author inserts thoughts from the characters when he has God speaking in the Scripture format. These thoughts and speaking of the characters did not happen.<br />4.<br />There is a lot of Talmud folklore in this story. God did not give people psychic abilities, He did not want us reading the stars and participating in astrology.<br />5.<br />The story of Adam and Eve and their spending 130 years separated from each other is totally not Biblical, neither is Noah being born circumcised, Abram was not the “savior” he has been seen to be in this book.<br />6.<br />Yes a lot of people use multiple sources to help them understand the Bible, this book should not be one of them, it’s fantasy and that’s it! If you study and meditate on God’s Word like intended, He will reveal to you the lessons He wants you to learn! I can’t stress enough READ YOUR BIBLE!!!!<br /><br />My list could go in and on, but take this as a fantasy story and NOT as a commentary or helpful source in understanding the Bible like the author would like you to do. The only good thing is this drove me to my Bible to double check and make sure things were actually written as he has them written.",2.0,0,2022
Top Notch Robert Bailey,"Rich Blood is suspenseful and intriguing. Attorney Jason Rich is right up there with my favorites, The McMurtrie  and Drake series and the Bocephus Haynes series. Jason Rich is a totally different character with his own team and his own challenges but the feel of the Southern Courts and Bama football is much in line with Robert Bailey's other beloved series. There are several tie-ins that are reminders of those great characters, real and fictional.<br /><br />This is a top notch Robert Bailey creation. The book, and case, start out very black & white, clear cut. As the story unfolds you realize things aren't always as they seem, lots of shades of gray. There are unexpected twists and turns. And then the biggest reveal, the epilogue, alone  is worth reading this book.<br /><br />I look forward to more Jason Rich.",5.0,1,2022
"""Girls like me don't make it to the end of the story""","Girls like me don't make it to the end of the story.<br /><br />🎶 And now she's back! From outer space! 🎶<br /><br />Our wonderful Queen Kresley is back from her mysterious personal hiatus and can I say that I am super psyched?! Her last release was The Arcana Chronicles 6: The Dark Calling (a YA series) in 2018, and before that the last Immortals After Dark book we got was Wicked Abyss in 2017. You can follow her newsletter for more info on her new releases, but we value our author friends' personal privacy so please don't ask her any personal questions on her form! I can tell you that the next book she plans to release is Book 7 in the Arcana Chronicles. We don't have a date for that yet, but you can follow my social media pages for more insider news on Kresley's books since I'm on her ARC Team (a dream come true for a reader like me!)<br /><br />Back to Munro. Last we left the IAD series, we heard at the end of MacRieve that he was being held captive by a group of warlocks called The Forgotten who ""vassal"" (i.e. enslave via sorcery) Lykae in a hidden realm called Quondam to prepare for the war against the Morior. So they should be allied with the Vertas but no, they're going about it completely the wrong way - kidnapping Lykae and forcing them to turn mortals into newlings, young Lykae who cannot control their beasts for more than a decade. The Forgotten, led by Jels the Conniver, can't vassal the Lykae until they release their beasts.<br /><br />They kidnapped Munro because an old and powerful Lykae like him should have a decent success rate at biting and turning mortals into newlings. The problem is that Munro is so old and powerful that he has too great of control over his beast, and won't release it no matter how they torture him. Oh, but they've also got the ability to time travel - but it requires sacrificing Nymphs at the altar of their very screwed up deity. They go back in time and find Kereny, Munro's mate, who is a carnie from 100 years ago. They injure her to the point of death so that he's forced to release his beast to bite and turn her. Only she doesn't turn. She dies.<br /><br />Munro manages to break free of enslavement, and threaten a vow from the Lore from Ormlo, Jels' son, to open a portal so he can go back in time and grab her again from the point of her death at 29 years old. But she's not just a carnie. She's a hunter of immortals in the Night War. She's been killing newlings who run rampant through her time, killing entire villages in their rage state. So it's basically her worst nightmare to be turned into a Lykae. And did I mention she's married?<br /><br />This book was a little different from the previous books. For one, there wasn't as much tension between the two protagonists. They were enemies in name only and had a disagreement over Kereny's mortality, but it wasn't nearly as tense as other books. I think Kresley (and us) really needed a warm sweet book after these past few really terrible years. She really turned down the dial on the toxic traits of the alpha male. We all new Munro was a good guy - I mean between emotionally carrying his brother for millennia and fostering orphaned young Lykae, he's prime DILF material. So I suppose it wasn't a complete surprise. He's just a thousand year old dog who needs to learn a new trick. After my reread of the series it was a bit jarring, because the tension rachets up with each book - and then doesn't taper off but bottoms out in this one. As I said - I think that was intentional.<br /><br />As someone who has read her entire catalog, it's been so amazing to see how her skill has increased over the years. I've read both the mature PNR and the YA she writes - and the intricate webs she weaves are some of the most impressive I've seen across anything I've read - especially in these genres. This is high fantasy quality plotting in genres that don't see that kind of thing often and I appreciate it so much more for that.<br /><br />I personally enjoy the high tension in her other books - but I also really appreciate the high quality writing of the personal growth of Munro in this book. Some of the biggest problems I have in the romance genre are toxic traits being lauded as appealing. Listen, we all have our kinks, but many of us have recently become aware of a very young age group reading erotic romance. I'm not one for censoring books, but just like anything else, it requires guidance. If the girls reading these are not being guided by the women more experienced in relationships, they may see real men behaving in the toxic ways they recognize from books and be attracted to it instead of recognizing the red flag. In this book, Munro is so concerned with making Kereny immortal and assuming that he knows best that he completely disregards her wishes. He doesn't try to see it from her perspective. But he learns from his mistake - he's not rewarded for it. This is teaching girls (and women) to recognize it as a toxic trait.<br /><br />Please don't misunderstand me - there is room for all kinks in books. Books are an amazing medium to express those in since many of those traits would be seriously concerning in real life. The debate I often see on social media is whether these books should even be written - but they are disregarding entirely the people who can read and discern. But the goal should be to teach people to read and discern, not to censor them from ever seeing anything that's unhealthy. Boy have I really gone off the deep end with this analysis, but I am going to try to do better on my platforms to talk about these things and teach.<br /><br />And that's what I appreciated most about this book - it truly is a teachable moment for Munro. This means that Kresley is keeping up with the times, and let's face it, that's a hard thing for most authors. So again, FRIGGIN YAY Kresley, I love her, I'm so excited she's back, and I cannot wait to see more from her.",5.0,1,2022

Ages 13+ spectacular clean read,"I don't usually write reviews because I read a ton of books and I'm lazy. I had to write this one as it had few reviews and I was enthralled. I'm including how I score books as I feel there are just too many people out there that slap 5 stars on about anything.<br /><br />My personal  ratings mean<br />1* This book should never been written, didn't finish<br />2* I hated the book but struggled to make it to the end.<br />3* I finished it, some things bothered me. I won't read more books from them.<br />4* I really enjoyed a book. Would finish the series and possibly read more from the author.<br />5* All time favorite, I'll get on this author's newsletter, read everything they write multiple times, and refer to all friends and family.<br /><br />I discovered Casey Bond a few weeks ago and I'm totally hooked. She writes what I would call steamy clean. Lots of great tension and romance without all the dirty details. I love this one in particular as it reads with the maturity of an adult novel while being appropriate for YA.<br /><br />This book, like her others, is a complete and unique world. She creates new places and cultures in each of her writings. So many books now are repetitive. It's like a breath of fresh air to have something unique. The characters have incredible depth that you fall in love with.<br /><br />Many of her books are stand alone or duologies but the endings leave you feeling you have been immersed in a deep and complete world. There is a cliffhanger in this one and I'm not sure how many more books are coming.<br /><br />Something many will appreciate it this reads like it has been professionally edited. Not just the grammar but clear ordering of thoughts, logical storylines, and consistent characters. I don't know if she has a really good editor or that she is skilled. You would never guess this is an indie author.<br /><br />Don't wait. Start reading her novels now!!!",5.0,1,2022
Good book,"Overall the book is good but I do have to take exception to one thing. The author says very little is known of the culture and practices.<br /><br />There was a quite a bit known.<br /><br />The ancestors of Koko Willis were caretakers of a series of stories that was recorded and then published with the help of author Pali Jae Lee. These stories go back about 3,000 years.<br /><br />Also the endless work to record the Hawaiian mythology  And the Kumulipo by Martha W Beckwith.<br /><br />Also minister WD Westervelt also recorded Hawaiian stories and published them in at least two books<br /><br />I know this because I have been researching Hawaiian stories, mythology, language, culture, and the taboo (kapu) system the Hawaiian people lived by. And trying to piece together the spiritual beliefs of the Hawaiian people.<br /><br />I’ve probably read 150 books on the subject, and I don’t have a warm fuzzy feeling from hardly any of them<br /><br />For numerous reasons<br /><br />This book ends with Tahitian people and power mad priest Pa’ao who set up the worship of the numerous gods including the god of war Kuka’ilimoku that demanded human sacrifice",5.0,1,2022
Not nearly the writing style found within the other novels,"Don’t like the overuse of sassenach, (unnecessary & thought we’d moved forward) do not care for the style in which the novel was approached, the whole book feels as though some other people were doing the writing.

Epic time travel!,"What if criminals were sent back in time to the time of the dinosaurs. Would people still commit crimes? I certainly wouldn't want to tangle with a T-Rex. Sam, one member of a group responsible for creating Absolom and Absolom 2, devices used mainly to send the worst criminals back in time, and his daughter Adeline are suspected of killing his colleague. Eventually Sam takes the rap and is convicted of the crime. He is sent back to the Late Triassic period as punishment. In order to figure out who actually did it, Adeline decides to go back in time to see who the actual murderer is so her father will be exonerated and brought back. There's plenty of action to keep this book moving and plenty of creative ideas to chew on. The idea of bringing people through time leads to the idea of righting past wrongs and saving innocent lives. The past serves as a door to new opportunities in the future, a future that many may not have had the opportunity to live. A.G. Riddle writes some very intense novels. This is one of those books you don't want to put down. It's like an adult version of the Magic Treehouse books. I am looking forward to any sequels! If you are into time travel, order up! This one was made for you.",5.0,1,2022

This should be more focused on what its title implies its about,"I bought this book because I have been diagnosed with Autism and I have lived my life with a lot of difficulty in maintaining friendships and romantic relationships. I would love to know more about how to find and maintain these better. I want to know signs that I am doing things the wrong way. It can be hard to step outside myself to see how I am behaving and read the other person.<br /><br />I have read almost half of this book. It starts out nicely in pinpointing that autistic people need help with these things and why they do. But it quickly dives into focusing on social justice topics as well as this whole neurodiversity viewpoint. There is plenty about that in this book but not as much about the title. My trouble with this book isn't just how it skews away from the title though. It just has this perspective that instead of trying to understand people better and better your own social skills, other people are to blame. It calls non-autistic people ""allistic"" and at any opportunity to puts them down. It expects these people to accomodate YOU. I think this is an entitled way of handling autism. I WANT to mask. I WANT to fit in. Autism is my mental disorder and thats fine. I just want to live with it and be happy. Humans are a social animal and autism impairs the most fundamental part of that. If a fish would have trouble swimming, you wouldn't see that as an advantage.<br /><br />If I finish this and change my mind, I will change my review.",2.0,0,2022
Hate the MC,"***This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />Although Marie is in my top 5 favorite authors, I haven’t been a fan of this series so far. The writing is still great, and I mostly enjoyed the plot, the interactions with the fae, and the bigger introduction into druid magic. However, it’s really hard to like a book when you can’t stand the main character.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, there is nothing to like about Saber. She’s purposefully weak, makes terrible decisions, endangers everyone around with her selfish disregard of their advice or wellbeing, and thinks she can solve every issue with a puny switchblade (that she threatens Zak with over and over). She finally has a moment of self reflection late in the book that she’s the reason bad things happen to those around her, but then still wallows in self-pity at the worst possible time and nearly gets them all killed.<br /><br />I have truly loved all the main characters in this author’s universe up until this point (with Piper and Tori being my favorite). They’re all flawed, but they’re still likable and relatable enough that you spend the whole book cheering them on through their successes and failures. Saber doesn’t fall into that category for me. By the end of this book, I was honestly just sick of reading about her. She’s not sassy or sarcastic, she’s just mean-spirited while also being pretty pathetic. I wanted something or someone better for Zak.<br /><br />The only reason I might grab book three was the possibility of seeing some of the characters I actually like coming out to say hi. Otherwise, this would be my last try on this series.",3.0,0,2022
Such a useful book!,"I bought “Chinese Jews” because it is a topic that I have heard about but know very little of. This is probably one of the most mysterious and least discussed of the Jewish diasporas, how did they end up in China and how did they survive all these centuries. Their arrival in China might be the very first interaction between the Jewish people and the Chinese empire.<br /><br />The 21st century is undoubtedly a century of power struggle between the US and China, and Israel plays a no small part in this sensitive relationship. Does this tiny little isolated Jewish diaspora play any role in this, how will it evolve and be impacted. All unknown, all interesting.<br /><br />The amount of content in this book is overwhelming. I am thankful for the author’s immense research, clear organization and imparting what is most typically addressed in academic papers in layman’s language.",5.0,1,2022
Just Couldn't Do It...,"I just could not get into this. I spent a week trying over and over again, thinking eventually it would click. At 20%, I realized it wasn't going to happen, and I was just wasting time. Time I could be spending reading something much more enjoyable. I used to beat myself up for anything that ended up on the DNF (Did Not Finish) shelf. Not anymore! Life is too short to read bad novels, and there's too much material out there, to put that type of pressure on myself.<br /><br />There's just so many issues with this book, I'm not even sure where to begin.<br /><br />There's a lot of holes in the story. Poorly developed and executed, leaving this reader wanting more expansion on what was happening.<br /><br />Where extra details are provided, they seemed trivial, or just unnecessary to the storyline.<br /><br />It reads more along the lines as juvenile, but because of the constant sexual innuendos, and sometimes straight out mentioning, this would never pass for YA. Maybe I just didn't read far enough in, to understand the importance of these, other than in reference to the title word of ""Inappropriate."" These references weren't even presented in a strategic manner to appear to have any bearing on the storyline, but more so in an almost disrespectful, poking fun at demeanor.<br /><br />There's very little character building presented by 20%, I felt no sense of connection, empathy, or attachment nor interest to any of them.<br /><br />The main character comes off as a weak, whining, depressing, self entitled, passive-aggressive individual, and it makes it hard to create any inroads towards caring what their futures may hold.<br /><br />The small amount of magic scattered throughout the book so far, is another area where development lacks.<br /><br />World building, which is especially key in Fantasy novels, lacks expansion and elaboration. Maybe they should've just tagged the book as satirical and humorous, and left off the fantasy tag altogether.<br /><br />For having an average rating of 4, and 5 books to the series so far, it obviously appeals to an appreciative, selective and dedicated audience. I just don't appear to be in that bracketed subgroup.<br /><br />Can not recommend for the majority of readers out there.",1.0,0,2022
Didn’t make it past chapter 3,"I had high hopes for this series after reading the glowing reviews, but sadly it didn’t deliver.  I guess there are more clueless people out there than I imagined, and I’m not a prepper , or a survivalist.  But, even I spotted the major stupidity of the main character (the author had been painting as an intelligent, self-sufficient woman) at the beginning of chapter 2, when she walks up to the door of the lodge and tries the door.  When she finds it locked, she then Carrie’s her daughter over to a stand of trees to hide her - then crouches down to move stealthily back to the cabin…..Ummm??<br /><br />The clincher for me was chapter 3 where the author introduces Jack and his family who own the lodge, and have returned.  The author describes how Jack and his father built the lodge, and purposely made it appear abandoned to discourage squatters…..What??!!  That’s exactly the kind of place ‘squatters’ would be looking for - an abandoned building!!!<br /><br />I never made it to the part another reviewer commented on about Jack’s military background as a Seal, yet the few firearms he owns are only suited for target practice, and shooting squirrels.  And, yes, it was already becoming clear by chapter 3 that this read more like a hastily written romance novel.",1.0,0,2022
DNF FOR ME,Do you know the first four pages are like watching a movie from the 1920’s with overacting? I don’t get the appeal of this book. It’s uncomfortable to me.

"I don't normally not finish books, but this was BAD.","This book was terrible. This book was so bad if I had a choice between nothing and reading this on a 14-hour flight, I would sit quietly with my hands on my lap. I gave it the first five chapters to get going, and even that was painful. This book is the only book I've ever read with the exception of battlefield Earth that I would call ""distractingly boring""<br /><br />Like, you want to keep reading the book because it's so bad but how bad it is distracts you from reading it. It's a conundrum. I'm not sure if this is the author's first outing but it was very clunky, self indulgent, boring and to be 100% honest it felt like something a 15 year old would write.",1.0,0,2022

Rough,"The premise of the book is basic: there are four supernatural clans (Frankenstein, Vampire, Mummy, Werewolf) that have retreated into the shadows with the advent of technology, and taken over different aspects of the criminal underworld. For some unexplained reason, these clans all exist entirely in London. In addition to these clans, there is another organization that exists solely to fight them, but the process of joining them will make you a sociopath. The novel follows an ex-cop who joins the organization through his missions to destroy the clans.<br /><br />Why did an organization of sociopaths decide to protect humanity? Against all reasonable expectations the ex-cop doesn’t ask this question, so the reader is left worrying at the implausible setup like food stuck between their teeth until the end of the novel. This is just the beginning of the annoyances. I’ll list a few more. The main character falls in love with the first woman he meets, his new partner, on the first night they meet and work together, and she reciprocates right away. The missions, which have supposedly been planned for years, consist of embarrassingly vague instructions like “sneak up on them while they’re meeting at location X and kill them somehow”. One would think the agents would learn about their targets beforehand, but the main character repeatedly doesn’t ask for this information until they are already in fights, e.g. he didn’t know werewolves don’t need a full moon to change until he was active on a mission.<br /><br />There are more annoyances, and together they weigh down the novel and make it hard to take the action, plot development, and explanation of the world seriously.",3.0,0,2022
Ruined by liberal elitism,"I am a finisher, meaning I’ll read even the worst books to the very end.  The love story in this would have gotten a solid 4 stars, BUT the thick liberal elitist attitude was nauseating and I can’t in good conscience give it more than a single star!<br /><br />A man pulling out a chair is not looked at as chivalrous, but stuck in the 1960s.  A man can’t pay for his date’s food to be nice (again, chivalrous), without throwing in a comment about pay gaps.  So many degrading references to white men.  There is literally no worse turn off to a reader than to break the fourth wall by preaching to the readers.  PSA likely half of your readers are conservative women that think for themselves, but love and cherish the men in their lives and don’t look at life as though they are always the victim.  The author, if she indeed has a neuroscience background, should be aware that a part of our brain turns on when we have an attachment to things (ie why you see yellow cars everywhere if you have a yellow car).  In the same way, if you are looking for ways to feel the victim and that white men are the devil, you will see this everywhere (even if it’s manufactured to fit your bias).  Just something for the author and readers to think about.",1.0,0,2022
A very enjoyable read!,"It's hard to describe why this book was so enjoyable.  I guess it was a number of little things that added together to make it so.

There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life:  music and cats. ~ Albert Schweitzer,"Full Disclosure:  I loved all these (Un) stories from Jennifer Joy!  A whole lotta light-hearted fun and always a companion animal (or six) to add to the Joy!<br /><br />This time, the companion is a cat, Serafina, a particular friend of Miss Georgiana Darcy.  But, as Ernest Hemingway said, “one cat just leads to another” and Serafina is awaiting a blessed event, courtesy of the tom cat who eliminates vermin from Pemberley’s kitchen.<br /><br />Cats seem to go on the principle that it never hurts to ask for what you want. ~ Joseph Wood Krutch<br /><br />Georgiana’s story has a complication:  Caroline Bingley is not the only one hoping for a match between her brother and Fitzwilliam Darcy’s sister.  No, Georgiana is also convinced she is in love with Charles Bingley — but we must remember, of course, that she thought she was in love with George Wickham only months before.<br /><br />Darcy hopes for his sister’s happiness and assumes it can be found in the person of his friend.<br /><br />What will he do when it becomes obvious to everyone that Bingley is seriously interested in Jane Bennet?<br /><br />Then, as promised, someone is caught in a compromise!<br /><br />Dogs come when they are called. Cats take a message and get back to you later. ~ Mary Bly<br /><br />Kittens take the stage.  Poor Caroline!  Georgiana knows she cannot keep all the kittens.  Who will name them?  Who will keep one?  Can a kitten be removed from Colonel Fitzwilliam’s shoulder?<br /><br />I loved this jolly look at misdirected love and kittens, kittens, kittens!<br /><br />The problem with cats is that they get the exact same look whether they see a moth or an axe murderer. ~ Paula Poundstone<br /><br />The author gave me a free copy of this book.

I learned a lot from this book,"I enjoyed reading this book. I like to learn about my home state of California, so I read this cover to cover. It is full of information that I'd never learned from other sources. It is strongly focused on the multicultural aspect of this state, and relates a lot of information about racism, especially the atrocities perpetrated against our Native Californian first people.<br /><br />I was not at all disappointed with this history. The author did intentionally write it in a way to make it accessible for younger readers, and I think it would be appropriate for community college history classes. Even though I'm much older (nearly 70) I was very happy with the reading level and ease of understanding. It was not too juvenile for me, and definitely isn't for children. I typically read two to four chapters daily.<br /><br />I appreciated the little illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. I was reading a Kindle copy of the book and enlarged each illustration so I could see it well and guess at what the content of the chapter was going to be.<br /><br />I think the biggest strength of this book was that it exposes the hidden racist history in this state. The author didn't mince words or try to conceal the truth. This is history every Californian should become aware of. We need to know that just because California wasn't officially a ""slave state"" that doesn't mean there weren't slaves here or that all races were welcome. Sad but true.<br /><br />Thank you to the publisher for an advance copy of the book via NetGalley. I will always treasure the experience of reading this as I needed to know more about the state I call home. All opinions in this review are my own, sincerely given.",5.0,1,2022

Moving story about immigrants,"3 Stars, ok, not great. I purchased this book because my grandparents and great grandparents came through Ellis Island from Italy.  I haven’t been to Ellis Island, nor NYC, so it was exciting to travel to these places via the book.  I think the book portrayed the anxiety of the immigrants coming from so many countries, fleeing poverty and hunger, not knowing the language, etc., all very well.  The story is good but at times I felt like Alma (the girl of German descent, employed at Ellis Island), was a little bit of “social justice warrior,” and there were just a few tinges of “wokeness.” My grandparents and my father never felt “despised” and yet the author used this term several times to portray how the immigrants felt they were perceived.  I did like how the author included newspaper articles from that period about Ellis Island and the scandals that took place – the bribery, abuse, and mistreatment of immigrants on the part of inspectors and other staff.  I found Alma’s home life with German parents very interesting – how she was “promised”to a 40-year-old German man in marriage without even consulting her.  Francesca, from Italy, was a very strong character and endured a lot of sadness and abuse at the hands of an inspector at Ellis Island.  I recommend this book for readers who want to know more about immigrants and coming through Ellis Island.  Overall, a moving story.",3.0,0,2022
Wow,"I began reading this book and almost quit because I really disliked both of the characters. And then the whole vibe between them started changing.

And once they realize how they feel, they realize the other loves were not as real and deep as the love they now have with each other. There were a lot of steamy scenes that I found to be well written and part of the story. This will remain one of my favorite romance novels.",5.0,1,2022

good start but not as strong as I would expect,"I've been an avid fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series for almost two decades. Although the last few were showing signs of struggle, I eagerly anticipated the author's new series, Gabriella Rose. The Recovery Agent is its debut book, and while there are some similarities, it's also quite different and good on its own account. Gabriella hunts and retrieves missing antiquities or artifacts, and this time, she kicks off her search in Ecuador. When that one humorously fails, she's pulled into a more personal treasure hunt that takes her back to her hometown and then all over South America again.<br /><br />I enjoyed the character development and overall plot components of this installment. Gabriella's relationship with her ex-husband is amusing and he's highly reminiscent of a combo between Ranger and Morelli from the Plum series. I like him, and I definitely see the possibilities of them getting back together. The history of the missing treasure was fascinating, easily holding my attention. I was a bit let down by Gabriella's connection to her family. I wanted more from that part of the storyline, even in this first book. I'm sure it will come together. She ultimately comes across a little too cautious and standoffish, which can be good for a personality trait but not as the protagonist.<br /><br />I'll read the second one... it's not as outright silly/funny as Plum, but it's also got a bit more substance to the relationship and story side. Looking forward to seeing where this one goes.",4.0,1,2022

snooze,"I think the author did an amazing job writing about the friendship between Franny, Cleo, and Lola. I’d love a book about them back in college when they all met. But this book was so sloooooow and Franny and Hayes managed to have exactly zero chemistry. You know in a good romance how your heart might skip a beat as you relate to the story - maybe remembering something similar from your past? (And I’m not talking about the sexy times!) I felt nothing about these two other than boredom. Hayes Montgomery the Third is a stereotypical hot nerd, who appears to be loaded since he has a love of Gucci suits… but it’s never confirmed! Fanny is a somewhat annoying interior designer who is “broke” since being laid off from her job - she’s so broke she splurges on diamond earrings. They got together 75% through the book, broke up at 80%. I don’t want to spoil whether or not they got back together, but let’s just say I skimmed the last 15%.",2.0,0,2022

A big disappointment,"I read Cam's story in this series and really enjoyed it, so I decided to read this book since it was free. It wasn't even worth reading for free.  Zack and Nicole were very unlikeable-Nicole more so.  She was just a nasty person.  She was so mean to her next door neighbor-it drove me crazy!  I had to force myself to finish the book.  There was zero chemistry between Zach  (Nicole insisted on calling him Issac even though he preferred Zach-one of her many irritating traits) and Nicole.  I don't mind steamy scenes in the books I read, but a little emotional connection is very nice.  I didn't find any of that here.  I couldn't feel a connection to either character.

left me wanting,"I had a hard time relating to Breen with the lack of confidence despite amazing powers and strong connections with people who loved her. Honestly I thought more highly of Marco who always stood strong, supported everyone and looked to always get the most out of life.. Also never felt the connection between Keegan and Breen. He was awed by her powers but beyond that I never got why he was so drawn to her and her to him. Not even going to discuss how ridiculous the insertion of giving sapphire earrings in a crowd constituted pledging; as Marco would say, WTF? where'd that come from?<br /><br />Then there were plot lines that were never tied up. Like when Keegan went into the lake as a teenager, it was future Breen who spoke to him and basically guilted him into taking up the sword. Never mentioned or tied into their future doings. I was waiting for how that would play into the final story line and it never manifested. Or what the other errands were that Cedric had to do in Philly before he left after Breen discovered about the money.<br /><br />Shana's end was just anticlimactic. I suppose that's fitting for such an abhorrent character, but it really lacked suspense and drama.<br /><br />Overall I was underwhelmed. Enjoyed the Chronicles of the One and many of Nora's earlier trilogies much more. This one just didn't resonate with me.",2.0,0,2022
Amnesia is the silence of the unconscious. ~ Adrienne Rich,"If you could have selective amnesia, what memories would you forget?<br /><br />In Fitzwilliam Darcy’s case, his amnesia selects the years between his sister’s near-disaster at Ramsgate to the present time in his life — when he is married with a child.<br /><br />Darcy had gone for a punishing ride in a storm.  The first mystery:  why would he be riding in that weather?  Where did he intend to go?<br /><br />Quote from the book: And somewhere, amid the dark chaos, a riderless horse screamed, and Darcy heard the echo of thundering hoofs. Panic and pain assailed him in equal measures as he realised it was his horse and that he was no longer upon it.<br /><br />Darcy is saved by his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and a rescue party.  His hand and leg are seriously injured.  Less obvious initially, he discovers that his memory is also impaired.<br /><br />Who is this dark-haired woman who is said to be his wife?  When did he marry?  Why did he choose this woman?<br /><br />Fear creates a form of spiritual amnesia. ~ Max Lucado<br /><br />Darcy slowly realizes that his wife and Colonel Fitzwilliam share a secret and zealously keep it from him.  What did they discuss in the garden?  Why did the Colonel leave Pemberley suddenly?  Why does he write to Elizabeth and not to Darcy?<br /><br />And through Darcy’s eyes, we see Elizabeth suffering.  Physical injuries are not the only pain possible. What regrets does Elizabeth hide?<br /><br />Heartbreak is its own form of amnesia. ~ Lauren Kate<br /><br />Another mystery develops:  why did the Darcys leave London for Pemberley and leave their toddler daughter behind?  Three-year-old Marianne — better known as Molly or “Papa’s little girl” — is saddened by the evidence of his injury.<br /><br />Quote from the book: Before he could answer, Molly brought his hand to her lips and kissed each of his fingers in turn. “I kiss them better?”<br /><br />Every time Molly enters the scene, she steals the show.  Don’t miss her tale of the enchanted scissors.  I loved her!<br /><br />This is a great book from a first-time published author.

Wicked Plan is Hatched Over an Inheritance,"""Over Her Dead Body,"" by Susan Walter is a scintilatting  read.  Louisa is a retired casting director who is holding a grudge against her two children who have all but abandoned her.  She considers leaving her massive estate to her attentive nephew Nathan, but he doesn't want any part of his cousins being disinherited. Enter aspiring actress Ashley, whose dog wanders onto Louisa's property.  When Louisa learns Ashley is looking for a break into an acting job, it is game on.  Louisa has a very nefarious plan, the success of which hinges on Ashley's desires to get auditions. Let's just say this is one of the most extreme scams I have ever read about, involving Louisa's two children, her nephew, her daughter-in-law, and Ashley.

"The ""History"" in this Historical Fiction is Shocking","As I was reading Lynda Rutledge's ""West With Giraffes,"" I didn't realize I was reading ""historical"" fiction. I thought it was just pure fiction surrounding rather unrealistic events, such as giraffes that survived a hurricane at sea while en route to America.  Hurricanes aren't common in New York, I told myself, even though I should have remembered Hurricane Sandy's devastation in New Jersey and surrounding areas not that long ago.  Well, the joke was on me.  That indeed did happen, not only the 1938 hurricane, but the fact that two giraffes survived the storm and then were driven across country to the San Diego Zoo, which had the only female director of zoos in the world at that time.  Rutledge did invent the captivating details of their trip west, with the narrator being Woody Nickel, now over 100 years old, remembering his great adventure as an orphaned refugee from the Dust Bowl who parlayed himself a job as the driver of the rig carrying the giraffes. In the 1930s, he was suffering PTSD from the horrors of losing his family and beloved horse to the ravaging winds and dust. On the trip, he falls in love with the magnificent giraffes and develops a friendship with Mr. Jones, an employee of the zoo entrusted with getting the giraffes to California.  An attractive young woman that Woody names ""Red"" for her hair color follows them in a green Packard, hoping to capture pictures that she can use to propel herself to fame. Woody becomes deeply infatuated with her.  Along the way, the trio of humans and duo of giraffes have many narrow escapes that I will leave to each reader to discover. Rutledge based those incidents on other current events and cultural situations of the day, again demonstrating the impressive amount of research that she did to produce this book. The 100-year-old Woody lives at a nursing home and is desperate to write down the details of the cross-country drive to the zoo, which he has never shared with anyone, while he is still living and is somewhat in control of his memory. For whom he is writing this missive is another mystery for the readers to discover.  This book is best enjoyed by animal lovers and people who are interested in American life during the Great Depression. I was surprised by reviewers that found the book boring. Yes, the journey is long, but that is what makes it so fun. Thank you, Lynda Rutledge, for this delightful read.",5.0,1,2022
Muderous Rampage Forty Years in the Making,"In 1977, a woman had packed her belongings and her two sons, Joe,10, and Robbie,15, into the family automobile, desperately seeking a fresh start in life. Their destination was her brother's apartment, where they had arranged to crash temporarily. With the worst possible timing, they approached New York City at the time of the infamous 1977 blackout.  To make matters worse, their car ran out of gas. Lois, the mom, exited the car, telling the boys to stay put and she would be right back.  However, she never returned or contacted the boys ever again.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2017.  Joe is now a functioning alcoholic attorney, whose binges result in blackouts of another kind. One day he is notified that a homeless person has been murdered on the beach, and authorities believe the woman is none other than his mother, Lois DeSantos.  Joe shows little emotion as he feels nothing but bitterness and resentment toward the woman who left him in the care of a 15-year-old to find their way from the outskirts of the city to their uncle's house in Staten Island. Uncle Mike was a good man, who had cared for Joe but died of AIDS when Joe was only 18. Brother Robbie was alienated from his uncle and brother.  Joe rarely saw Robbie but was able to give police a number to use for the death notification of their mother.<br /><br />When asked of his whereabouts when Lois was killed, Joe could not provide details, as he had been drunk out of his mind. Oddly, evidence begins to pile up indicating that Joe may have been involved in her death. Soon, Joe's ex-girlfriend is also killed, with additional suspicion falling on Joe, the alcoholic with no memory of recent events. Only Joe's attorney Aideen believes in his innocence, but realizes she is facing an uphill battle due to Joe's blackouts and connection to both victims, who were killed in the exact same manner by a broken neck. DNA evidence from both scenes is the last nail in his coffin. Joe and his attorney suspect that a criminal mastermind named Aaron Hathorne, a convicted child molester, was somehow pulling strings from the mental hospital to which Joe, in his role as an attorney, had Hathorne confined rather than released when his prison sentence was over. But that had to be so complicated as to be impossible, didn't it?  Switching in time from 1977 to 2017 throughout the book, Author Roger Canaff provides a complex tale of terror from the past and in the present, including the emergence of a character which left me in shock and awe. The book's themes are as dark as the blackout itself, but it was an entertaining read because of its intricate details and twists. (Trigger alert: If frequent foul language bothers you, this might not be a good choice.)",4.0,1,2022
A serious well written story with romance and some humor,"Rating: 4.5 🌈<br /><br />I hadn’t read Fireman’s Carry (The Hot Cannolis #0.5) by Eli Easton that was the source and inspiration for this series by Easton and Lain.  I will certainly go ahead and do that now that I’ve read this book and the romance of those characters.<br /><br />What is started there , a major fire and rescue of over 60 people by firefighter Mike Canali and civilian Shane Bower is where this novel’s storylines begins.  With the aftermath of those events,weeks later, in everyone’s lives.<br /><br />The events in that story are recounted somewhat so it’s not necessary to have read it to step into the people and their situations here.<br /><br />One important detail, however, that’s not mentioned anywhere, either in the descriptions or authors note.  There is a on page attempt at suicide, although it’s never actually termed that out loud.  Also character depression.  If any of this is a trigger for a reader,  please know this in advance so you be the best judge about whether to read the story or not.<br /><br />There are so many terrific elements here.  The characters are very well done.  Shane Bower and his Pops are amazing.  From the moment Shane makes his appearance on the page with his book club (who I also adored hugely) I was immediately engaged.  He was believable, likable, vulnerable, just everything you knew would end up pulling at your heart strings.  Then I met his grandfather, Pops.  And I was all in. Pops is another great character.  Throughly realistic and wonderful.<br /><br />I think most readers will  have mixed feelings about the Cannolis, the enormous Italian firefighter clan that Mike Cannoli belongs to.  I feel they are pretty realistic myself in the way they are portrayed.  I’ve know a family very similar to them and while some may argue they may seem too black and white in their characteristics, I can argue that those personality traits are also very believable and true .<br /><br />The men , father and brothers, were very homophobic and followed that old hard core  machismo  that impacted every part of their lives from childhood up.  For Mike, having to live up to their ideals and endure their rigid idea of masculinity made the stress upon his daily life an ever increasing pressure he wasn’t even aware of. Until he was. When the very out Shane Bower enters his and his family’s life.<br /><br />The authors accurately portrayed what happens when the status quo is upset within a traditional Italian family, with the women on one side and the men on the other.<br /><br />The majority of the story deals with Mike and his coming to grips first with his sexuality, then with the idea of a relationship, then the overwhelming fear of being known as gay to his family.  This is really his story and it’s a realistic, painful one.<br /><br />Shane is just as much a part of it as a out and proud gay man in love with someone who can’t accept himself.  That’s another element and equally hurtful. To Shane and Mike.<br /><br />The support characters, from the wonderful women of the Cannoli family to Shane’s friends to a surprise in the form of Donny, give this story extra depth. I love them all.<br /><br />Mike’s depression and the events that follow feel accurate but deserve a trigger warning.  FYI.<br /><br />I am recommending this story.  I wouldn’t call this a romantic comedy however. There’s humor but the focus is serious and dramatic while still including the romance.<br /><br />I liked that the authors recognizes that not everyone would be able to come around and accept Mike’s new sexuality completely. That’s just not realistic given his family.  Thanks for keeping it real!<br /><br />I’m really looking forward to the next in the series. It’s Donny’s story, Hot Winds.  Can’t wait.<br /><br />Until then pick this up and enjoy!<br /><br />The Hot Cannolis series:<br /><br />- [ ] Fireman’s Carry (The Hot Cannolis #0.5) by Eli Easton<br />- [x] Hot Seat #1<br />- [ ] Hot Wings #2 - March 29, 2022",5.0,1,2022

This is a simply written story that is easy to understand.<br /><br />Nao helps Tommy to learn that once you lie, it’s hard to gain trust.<br /><br />Tommy also shows Nao how honesty is important when you admit you did something wrong it is easier to fix the problem and make amends.<br /><br />The boys devise a signal making a T sign with their hands. This gives Nao the courage to tell the truth to their mother.<br /><br />Nao is tempted to do some thing wrong and decides to be kind at the end of the book. I liked how the book ended.<br /><br />I’m sure children can relate to these different scenarios as Nao is learning how to be honest in different ways.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for a young reader. It is thoughtfully written and highlights the good virtue of honesty.",5.0,1,2022

The ending was uncalled for,"The ending had me upset, don't want to spoil anything but I think we can all agree it didn't need to be that way.

For a good 70% of the book she let so much of his bull slide it seemed like as long as he ate her taco shed forgive him. I loved the babies and even though I have NEVER liked Azar or Melina i expected not to like them as much in this book, but this book was entertaining in its own way.

Redundant and the Scooby Doo mystery was extra,I love this author but this story was tediously boring. It had a great start with Piper finding Brock naked.

Thought it was just me…,"I have really taken to the new genre Paranormal Womens Fiction.

Could not get over the H having 2 daughters with 2 different women on the same day!,"I really wanted to like this book but unfortunately I couldn't get past Jaxson having a child with the ow.

I also truly didn't understand why Nicky lied about cheating on Jaxson when she left.  And how did the whole town know about the supposed cheating?  Obviously Jaxson had to have been telling people and allowed people to be rude and say horrible things to her when he supposedly still loved her.  Not my idea of a H.<br />The epilogue they are all best friends living next door to each other and the girls, (one with the h and the other with the ow) are best friends?

A Flawed but Brilliant Read,"I love Louise Penny. I love the characters she’s created in Armand Gamache, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, Clara, Ruth, and the citizens of Three Pines. I love the town of Three Pines. I love the way her novels weave together multiple storylines, and deal with deeper issues than merely “whodunnit.”<br /><br />Louise Penny is a master of her craft.<br /><br />And A Better Man is another engrossing read—layered, nuanced, gripping.<br /><br />And yet, there are certain things that stick in my craw. Like the way art, in Penny’s Gamache/Three Pines universe is either “genius” or “crap.” And the meaning of an individual work of art is set in stone, apparently not up for debate or interpretation.<br /><br />A single white dot in the eye of a portrait contains meaning, apparently, that anyone will/should/could interpret in precisely the same way, in Penny’s universe.<br /><br />While an interesting idea for a story, it is a hogwash idea in reality, where, of course, art/beauty/meaning all reside in the eye of the beholder.<br /><br />Yet so much of Penny’s plot points often rely on this notion: that art/quality/beauty/meaning are *objective*, rather than subjective. And it just irks me.<br /><br />I also had to question certain choices that the police officer characters made—inviting victims into their homes, that kind of thing. Would that really be allowed? I don’t know enough about protocol of the Canadian police, but I’m skeptical.<br /><br />Other than these issues, which required some rather intense suspension of disbelief, I was, as usual, drawn into the story, and Penny’s masterful writing. I could not put the book down and raced through it in a couple of days.<br /><br />As long as I go into a Louise Penny book with the understanding that this is fiction, and likely not adhering to reality except in the fact that the laws of physics apply, I can sit back and truly enjoy her books.<br /><br />I’m looking forward to the next fantasy mystery!",5.0,1,2022
In my humble opinion THIS IS A BADLY WRITTEN BOOK.,"Nicole Snow doesn’t write bad books until she does. And I’m sorry but this is one bad book.<br />Cole “the supposed Hero of this story” comes off during the whole book as an unjustified controlling billionaire who can do no wrong. For some reason Nicole evidently thinks this is a sexy way to write this novel. It isn’t.<br />And sadly the heroine Eliza is constantly reliving her past and how it effects her today. And how she is not good enough for Cole. This whole concept is just wrong!<br />There are way to many obscene words and scenarios and after a while they are just repetitive word space occupiers.<br />The actual story had real promise and if she had eliminated the garbage the story would have been amazing at half the length.<br />Feel free to read the book and tell me I’m wrong, but specifically why you are correct and why I’m wrong. I don’t think any discerning reader will be able to do so.<br />I’m just very glad I’ve finally finished this story.<br />I will read more of Snows work and hopefully they are better than this offering.",1.0,0,2022

All her sessions are recorded and this is how we learn about her patients. Dr Hale has disappeared after writing a best-selling book, The Anatomy of Fear and her boyfriend at the time Luke is suspect no 1.

Terrible Solutions and Panic-Driven Thinking,"Having coached college athletes and seen firsthand the damage inflicted upon young people's attention  by social media and technology, I agree wholeheartedly with the author Mr. Hari that we are in the middle of a human crisis even more pressing than Climate Change. My scholarship college athletes struggled to make it through a 90 minute practice without incessantly checking their phones. Many adult friends experience the same withdrawal.<br /><br />The first half of Stolen Focus identifies all of the major psychological shifts that manifested with the increased popularity of phones and their apps. The author concludes that technology in general and social media apps specifically are built to steal our attention and keep us addicted to our phones. There can be no refuting this point. Any person alive in the the 20th century has experienced this phenomenon and felt the twinge of guilt for wasting several hours each day on pointless phone viewing. Youtube, TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat became billion-dollar companies precisely because they exploit a weakness in the human mind that craves the dopamine apps offer. Again, the first half of the book excels in its research, and reaches scary but real conclusions about the danger of social media and similar apps.<br /><br />The second half of Stolen Focus is where things start to disintegrate quickly as Mr. Hari offers solutions to the challenges he presented in the first section. He claims that because the problem with phone apps is systemic, literally built into the system, it cannot therefore be solved individually. At one point he clearly states that an individual cannot overcome addiction to phone apps, and compares the inability of humans to stop looking at apps to their inability to stick to a diet. He casually throws out the statistic that 95% of dieters gain their weight back within 5 years, concluding any and all attempts to resist phone apps will result in similar fashion.<br /><br />The bad news, he says, is that we cannot take personal action and solve this problem. Well, what are we to do then since we are powerless slaves to Big Tech? His solution, which he defends vigorously for the remaining chapters, is for Big Government to regulate these corporations ""for the common good,"" to ultimately save us from ourselves. If only the government would put reasonable regulations on these companies, forcing Big Tech to limit their mind control over the ignorant and helpless masses! At this point Mr. Hari compares the obesity epidemic to the problem of psychological phone addiction. He claims the rise of obesity is caused by food companies flooding the market with cheap, sugary foods, rendering us powerless to resist in the exact same way software companies flood our phones with addicting apps. The solution to both problems is government agencies making healthy choices for us.<br /><br />Here's why govt regulation wont work and never did in the past for these problems. First, humans don't need nor want government to tell them what to eat, watch, smoke, or how to spend their time. Second, when we open the door for regulation, we give up control to a select few people who may or may not make decisions that we agree with. For instance, let's say we accept food regulation and the FDA taxes all sugary foods and subsidizes all ""healthy"" food. Now a cupcake costs more than a bag of kale and, in theory, common people will buy less cakes and more vegetables. Except people won't because carrots don't release dopamine and sugar does. Broccoli isn't addictive and people will still crave ice cream. Soda will go into the shopping cart like always albeit at a higher price, deepening the hit to the family budget. Anyone who seriously believes raising prices on sugary foods will slow buying has no idea about the real world.<br /><br />Caffeine is a highly addictive stimulant with the highest amount of addiction worldwide. Does Mr. Hari rant about regulating the destructive stimulant caffeine, slapping high taxes on evil corporations like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks? Don't be silly, of course not. Why? Because we want our coffee! We have the right to ingest what we want in the amount we want, it's called freedom! Even if that freedom causes us migraine headaches and withdrawal symptoms whilst emptying our bank accounts on $6 sugary coffees. Ironically, Mr. Hari's previous book was about the futility of the war of drugs, the exact thing he desires for apps. But society wants apps and they deserve access just like they deserve the option to play video games, eat sugar and smoke cigarettes.<br /><br />Like all liberals, Mr. Hari blames the capitalist system. Myspace was the Facebook of 2002 until a better option came along and then, poof, Myspace was gone without pesky govt regulation. Facebook's engagement has plummeted in the USA since 2019 because young people think Facebook is lame, and it will soon go the way of Myspace. That is why Facebook pivoted their resources into the Metaverse. Instagram is slowly losing engagement as well with the shift of users to TikTok and Snapchat. In 10 years all of these popular apps will disappear. It's called capitalism and it works. People get bored and crave something new. What they don't want is some guy in a suit choosing what is best for them.<br /><br />And lastly, why does Mr. Hari reject the idea of personal responsibility? According to his book, because he has personally failed with his attempts to throttle his lifestyle. He gained weight eating bad foods and blamed the food companies; he's addicted to the dopamine of Twitter and blames the algorithm; he can't focus and feels lonely without his phone and it's Google's fault. No, sir. Mr. Hari, put down your phone and live your life. Not everyone struggles with addiction the same way you do. And more importantly, leave others to make their choices.<br /><br />What Mr. Hari lacks is self-discipline. Maybe he needs an app for that.",2.0,0,2022
How tolerant are you of wokeisms?,"According to the author, this is supposed to be a book for people who ""need a break"". It succeeds in that regard to some degree. While this is a comforting, relaxing book it also verges dangerously close to static and inert. Not much happens, there isn't much conflict. This is a very quick book to read and it slips by as a pleasant but slightly vacant distraction. Setting those aspects of the book aside, the book reads like an invocation of a fantasy world for someone obsessed with the gender, environmental, economic and social concerns of the modern American left. The main character is carefully pronouned and any hint of gender specificity for this person has been careful scrubbed from the text... to the point where that's literally their defining characteristic. The main character drives a hand-painted, bike-driven caravan around and makes tea for people for free, which seems like the definition of an ideal career to certain Reddit-dwellers and Bernie fans. The world has, of course, learned its lessons and moved on from the evils of capitalism, meritocracy and environmental exploitation. People have been rightly taught to see themselves as shameful impositions on the world and have scrubbed themselves of any harmful ambition. Wise robots, who of course we had previously exploited, return to teach us lessons in how to be more ""flexible"" and get out of our gosh darned rigid shells like they're yoga instructors or something. Everything is just a little too precious and cozy. Et cetera. Your tolerance for this heavy-handed messaging likely varies. You'll either find it comforting to imagine a world where all of this is true or you'll roll your eyes at the naked wish fulfillment of it all. I found it to be mildly enjoyable but high on the eye-rolling scale.",3.0,0,2022

3 1/2 Stars,"As much as I wanted to rate this higher, I just couldn't do so because of a couple of issues that I found rather conflicting.<br />I tend to not like books that jump from time periods, and this book helped me realize why. It's too difficult for the writer to keep the story flowing in a way that doesn't becoming confusing. This one definitely has that as an issue.<br />At times, I couldn't even keep the characters from the past straight, let alone keep the relationships to the present, on track.<br />My biggest issue came toward the very end of the book. A totally unexpected twist in the plot line, and as the chapter is wrapping up on how to handle the situation, the very next page/chapter suddenly jumps ahead 4 1/2-5 years, completely skipping how it was handled.<br />Throughout the entirety of the book, there's a lot of rather boring daily grind details, which just fills up pages in the book. And now when the pages need to be filled with details, now you skip it??<br />The description given by the publisher also didn't do a very good job on letting you know what to expect. Rather the opposite. I went in expecting something completely different, and was rather disappointed when it didn't live up to the that description given.<br />I mainly stuck it out from boredom, not liking to leave a book unfinished, and thinking it would eventually pick up.<br />It was just meh, and at least gave me something to do over the last couple of days, while battling a cold.<br />Not my style of writing, or typical genre, but it may apple to some.",3.0,0,2022
"not my favorite Breene series, couple of books shift perspective before returning","I highly recommend KF Breen, especially if you want something extra hot, with fun fleshed out side characters. I support women writers, and I appreciate women characters who have a mind of their own and transcend the typical women tropes and stereotypes.<br /><br />Many series out there, plenty of differences and nuances to all feel very different. I absolutely adore the Levelling Up series, and the Rose of Ruin series. However, I found myself kind of trudging through this Demon Days Vampire Nights series. I wont say it's bad, but I am not enamored like I am with the other two series I mentioned (I'm working through another series but cant recall the name. I like that too). This has a very low key spice level if you are scared of sexy stuff. This is super chill on that front, but it does have its moments.<br /><br />In usual Breene style, the side characters are well done. They add a lot of color and interest to the environment. Yet, just something about this story isnt doing it for me. I've low level enjoyed it. That being said there are 11 books, and I have read 3. When I got to #4, I realized it was through the eyes of another character, and then I think there are 1-2 other books that have that before returning to the character we started with. I know it all comes together, but since I wasnt entirely vibing this story, the change in perspective is jarring. So I stopped. Giving it a break as decided I needed to move on to something else at this time. Maybe if I liked any of the characters enough, or liked the overall story enough. I will likely persevere, but right now I have set this series aside. I LOVE this writer, and not all the stories are the same.. so please give one of the series a try.",4.0,1,2022
"A “fling to forever,” accidental pregnancy romance","When, during Leah’s early childhood, her single mother died, she and her twin brother and younger sister were split up and parceled out to different foster homes. Fortunately for Leah, she ended up in an excellent placement with a very kind woman. Because of the staunch emotional support she enjoyed, intelligent, independent Leah made it all the way through college, obtaining a business degree. Immediately after graduation, she was hired at a prestigious law firm in London and her working career was off to a flying start. But only a few months later, her prospects were torpedoed, because the romantic relationship she had formed with a coworker named Oliver abruptly ended when he cheated on her and dumped her. Suffering from crushed pride as much or more than heartbreak, Leah fled back to the small town where her foster mother lives to lick her wounds. At the start of this story, Leah has been holed up in the country for over a year, working far beneath her educational expertise in local, poorly paid, unskilled jobs. One such job arises when her foster mother’s good friend, who is housekeeper for a sprawling mansion owned by a mysterious man the locals have nicknamed, “the gazillionaire,” has injured her ankle and is unable to meet his demand to stock the mansion and clean it from top to bottom before his arrival within the next three days for a brief stay. Leah agrees to act as a temporary housekeeper, both as a favor to her foster mother’s friend, and because the gazillionaire is offering a huge amount of cash for any willing temporary housekeeper, and Leah could definitely use the money.<br /><br />Cleaning the mansion proves to be a daunting project for Leah, who has never held a cleaning job before. After a long, grueling day of dusting and vacuuming, Leah is hot and exhausted. Believing that the owner will not arrive for two more days, the temptation is irresistible for Leah to take a quick dip in the invitingly cool, Olympic-sized indoor pool. There are plenty of big, fluffy towels available for Leah to borrow one, but she momentarily hesitates due to her lack of a bathing suit. Ultimately, though, because there is no one around to see her, she feels no qualms about going skinny dipping for the first time in her life.<br /><br />Giovanni (“Gio”) Zanetti is a 29-year-old, tech billionaire who has been so anticipating a relaxing sojourn at one of his favorite estates, he has pushed forward his projected arrival date by two days. As he enters the spa area of his mansion, he is shocked to discover a voluptuous, naked woman in his pool. When she identifies herself as Leah, the temporary housekeeper he had been informed would be working for him, he is entranced both with her beauty and her sprightly personality. There is nothing of the siren in her attitude as she clings to the side of the pool, the nakedness he only briefly glimpsed hidden from view, as her body remains underwater and out of sight. In fact, her straightforward speech and unaffected attitude are refreshing to him, as someone who is constantly exposed to rapacious women who are blatantly eager to hook up with him, as a very wealthy man. On a whim, when it is obvious to him that lovely Leah has no idea who he is and has assumed he is merely an employee like her and not her boss, Gio decides to, just for today, be no one in particular, merely an ordinary man, with this intriguing woman he has just met, who is only briefly passing through his busy life. As a further, spur-of-the-moment impulse, Gio invites Leah to share dinner with him, which he cooks for her himself. He continues to be delighted with Leah’s company, and when he invites her to stay the night, he is elated when she agrees.<br /><br />Though 22-year-old Leah is more attracted to Gio than any man ever before, including Oliver, up until this moment she has been determined to not surrender her virginity until she is in a committed relationship. But all of a sudden, Leah decides to throw caution to the wind. She informs Gio of her complete lack of serious intentions right up front. This will be nothing more than a one-night stand. As a freewheeling divorced man who has no intentions of marrying ever again, this is music to Gio’s ears. Unfortunately for both of their footloose intentions, however, during their wildly passionate sexual interlude, the condom breaks, and Leah is not on the pill. Nor does she consider the option of taking a morning-after pill (something no HP heroine would ever do, which would eliminate the ubiquitous HP accidental-pregnancy and secret-baby plots). When, the following morning, Gio offers his business card to Leah to enable her to contact him in case she becomes pregnant, she discovers, to her dismay, that her temporary lover is not some nice guy on her own socioeconomic level, but the gazillionaire himself! Due to the fact that her previous relationship ended because of a horrendous deception on the part of awful Oliver, Leah massively overreacts to Gio’s comparatively minor deception, for which he had no malign intent. She throws a huge fit, rather redundantly declares she never wants anything to do with her one-and-done fling, Gio, ever again, and stomps out the door. Though Gio is greatly attracted to Leah, strongly desiring to have far more of a connection to her than one night of unbridled ecstasy, he is just as prideful as she is, and he makes no effort to pursue her and try to change her mind. In fact, if Leah did not end up getting pregnant (as LG heroines virtually always do), it seems clear from their mutual pig-headedness, that neither one of them would have ever reached out to each other again.<br /><br />This novel is the second in a trilogy called, The Stefanos Legacy. Each book stars a Stefanos sibling. In book 1, Promoted to the Greek's Wife, Ari Stefanos discovers, after his father’s death, that he has three half siblings from his father’s longtime, covert, extra-marital affair. Ari is determined to locate each of his siblings. In the process, he learns that one of them, a young man of 22, is a recently deceased addict, who had a child with another addict, who is also dead. In that story, Ari adopts his baby niece. In this novel, Ari tracks down Leah, informs her of the fate of her twin and introduces her to his wife and their mutual niece.<br /><br />This novel is unusual for HP in general, and LG in specific, in that it is the heroine, not the hero, who treats her romantic counterpart as a disposable fling. In addition, as a bit of interesting LG trivia, Leah is one of the very few LG heroines who has brown hair, rather than blonde or red hair. Gio is also the tallest hero LG has ever offered. Her heroes are never less than 6’1”, and usually always 6’3” or 6’4”, but Gio is a gigantic 6’5”. Almost all of LG’s heroines are around 5’, so Leah is a bit taller than the LG average, at 5’5”. The one thing that is consistent, though, in virtually every LG novel (and almost all HP novels in general) is that Leah is a virgin who gets pregnant the very first time she has sex with the hero. And, as a large percentage of LG heroines are, Leah is pregnant with twins. One other consistent theme in LG novels, that I personally enjoy, is that her heroines almost always have a rescue dog (sometimes more than one), and they are almost always a terrier blend. In the case of Leah’s dog, he is a tiny, ancient, three-legged, toothless, Yorkshire terrier.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solidly entertaining, LG, contemporary, billionaire romance. It is an interesting switch-up that the heroine is the one who takes the lead in this “fling to forever” plot but, personally, I’m not a fan of that popular romance-genre trope, whether the hero or the heroine instigates the meaningless sex that kicks off their relationship. I do enjoy the theme of newly discovered half-siblings that this series offers, which is an intriguing type of series that LG has successfully written multiple times over the years. One thing that wasn’t ideal for my particular taste in this novel is the fact that Leah and Gio spend a great deal of the book apart due to the fact that, as Leah only admits to herself toward the very end of the book, she spends all her time with Gio shutting him down and cutting him out of her life, because she refuses to ever give him the benefit of the doubt. For that reason, most of the story exists as an extended Dark Period, in which all seems lost between them. Making up for all the separation and angst between the unlucky lovers, however, is an excellent, extended epilogue, set seven years in the future, which convincingly portrays an HEA for this beleaguered couple.<br /><br />I rate this novel as follows:<br />Heroine: 3.5 stars<br />Hero: 3.5 stars<br />Romance Plot: 3 stars<br />Writing: 4 stars<br />Overall: 3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars",4.0,1,2022

A touching novel but with mixed moral messages,"Naigle has given readers a touching story of two people finding their way to being open to love. It is sort of an adult coming of age story. Both Adam and Merry Anna must work through many obstacles to consider the possibility of romance. While all of the characters are written well, my favorite was Zan. What a sweet girl. The plot is typical for romance, a budding relationship progressing with misunderstandings and hurt. The ending seems a bit rushed and is somewhat inconclusive. Perhaps we are to be expecting a sequel.<br /><br />My frustration with the book is in the mixed messages it contains about sexual morality among Christians. Merry Anna divorced her husband mainly because he had an affair. She appeared to have definite convictions about sexual fidelity in marriage. When she learns Adam has had many sexual encounters outside of marriage, it seems to be of no concern to her. Adam's attitude toward his sexual sin is disappointing. While he admits he has had his share of women, he claims he has always done the “right” thing, I suppose meaning using condoms. (2464/4158) He never owns up to his sin nor is he ever repentant, even though he is depicted as a Christian. Adam's character is certainly not what I expected nor am pleased about.<br /><br />This is a romance for younger readers who are of the opinion that causal sex outside of marriage is fine and not against God's will as long as one wears appropriate protection. For older Christians who still believe sex outside of marriage is sin and needs to be addressed as such, this novel will be a very frustrating one to read.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",3.0,0,2022
Exceptional writing & reflection for anyone who is willing to discover a life of cooperation & unity,"How To Be Loving is a gorgeous layout of what's ahead for us as human beings in this Aquarian Age. Many can feel a change in the air with where we are headed as a humanity -- from stiff competition and gnarly gains to cooperation and community driven all inclusive love. Danielle LaPorte is an incredibly gifted orator and author who delivers her point of view across the pages of this beautiful book with magnetic flair, helping us come home to our Hearts. The virtues, compassion, resilience, divine love -- all of this and more are presented in her most poetic ways, and really do help soften our rigidity around our personal, little selves. To develop a more inclusive view is to heal. Danielle shows us the way. As she says, this is not a map, this is a call to connect deeply with our Inner Nature so that we realize our own divinity, and in doing so, can resonate with the divinity in others, thus leading us to lives filled with graceful abundance for us all. To love something/someone is to include it into our Hearts. To discard something/someone is to create more polarity and pain and subsequent dis-ease and painful states for ourselves. What a brilliant gift and yes, a definite balm for us all, especially those starved for truth and expansive ways. This book is a must read for all willing to discover a more fluid way of living and breathing life into all our relationships with ourselves and our loved ones. To love deeply is to have lived fully. I hope other readers discover this gem and encourage others to look at the new earth through this purified lens. Thank you Danielle. This is the New Way!! Love.",5.0,1,2022

The first part of the book sets up the story about a family who goes through an unimaginable trauma and how they try to adjust to their new life. Much of it is very depressing, although the information about the Witness Protection program and how it wasn't suited for this innocent family is interesting.<br /><br />The second part of the book becomes too complicated and over-the-top with an average dad taking on organized crime and political conspiracies almost single-handedly. The things that occur get harder and harder to believe as the story progresses. I like the way things turned out in the end, but didn't enjoy the whole journey it took to get there. I remain a fan of Scottoline, but prefer other books she has written to this one.<br /><br />I received this ebook from NetGalley through the courtesy of Putnam/Penguin books. An advance copy was provided to me at no cost, but my review is voluntary and unbiased.",3.0,0,2022
Julias Kitchen Wisdom,"I purchased the kindle version AND the spiral book version.  In my opinion, if you're love Julia Childs, or are looking for a good introduction to her classic recipes - this IS the one to purchase first.  Love it.  I haven't received the spiral book yet, but I have already used the kindle version.  I try to purchase spiral backs because they stay open easily as you use them and while online/kindle versions are nice, there is nothing like holding an actual cookbook you can write on the pages your personal notes, see the pics, etc.",5.0,1,2022

DREADFUL,"I love Chris Bohjalian's books that I have read but found this one too terrible to finish.  I read all of the positive reviews before I ordered the book and can't believe that I read the same book as many of the other reviewers.  Nonetheless, I found the book too violent, too tedious, too confusing because of the number of characters and the constant switching back and forth from past to present.  The characters were poorly developed and I honestly didn't care what happened to any of them.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money.  Read some of Bohjalian's earlier books.",1.0,0,2022
Challenging read - worth it!,"Elizabeth George is one of my favorite authors and this was a fine addition to the Inspector Lynley series. NOTE: this review sort of assumes you have followed this series and know some of the continuing characters.  If you haven't you've got 20 books to read that should precede this.  The focus in Something to Hide is female genital mutilation (FGM) a practice outlawed most places but still carried out in parts of Nigeria and Somalia (and other countries), often in a brutal manner and always traumatizing. It is done to ""cleanse"" a girl and make her more desirable in marriage. George heartbreakingly tells a story of a Nigerian family in Whitechapel headed by a controlling and physically abusive man, Abeo Bankole and his wife, Monifa, who is caught up in her cultural obligation to be totally loyal to her husband -- often to extremes. At the center of the terrible tension in the home are Abeo and Monifa's two children, 18 year old Tani and eight year old Simi. Tani is fiercely protective of his younger sister and he has a secret: He's dating, which alone goes against all family expectations, and his girlfriend is very English and modern in her behavior, i.e., totally inappropriate. When Tani figures out that his parents are about to do something that might harm Simi, he begins to plan how to protect her, with his girlfriend's support. Because his father is out of control and furious with his son's failure to obey him in all things, this makes for a dangerous situation. Meanwhile, Deborah St. James, just off completion of a successful photo book is engaged to take photos of girls and women who have been subjected to FGM or who left home to escape FGM. She connects with an organization founded to protect these girls and both gets involved and must deal with strong resistance to her interference with a community she cannot understand because of her race and wealth.<br /><br />A too small police unit, tasked with trying to address FGM through community education and criminal enforcement; a doctor who does reconstructive surgery to relieve pain and reduce infections due to FGM and possibly to restore sexual sensation; a mysterious woman who runs a clinic that performs medicalized FGM under anesthesia and with safer procedures; and a Nigerian born Detective Sergeant's murder bring other angles to the nature of the problem. Along the way, various characters struggle with personal and cultural/social problems. The book deals with issues of racism, raising a severely disabled child at home, cultural clashes, economic clashes, infidelity, several types of relationship problems between coworkers, friends, spouses, parents and children, and lovers… and Nigerian cooking - no really.<br /><br />My favorite thing outside the main story, which was emotionally powerful and hard and well-told, was that we learned more about Winston Nkata and his family. I loved the Barbara Havers part of this story that included the usual interference with her life from her friend Dee who means well and drives her crazy, but also another friend trying to ""help"" her and blowing it. I swear I would read these novels just to know what her t-shirts-- that she wears to work despite a lot of blowback-- will say. There are a number of cats and a dog who play fun roles in the book. What did not work for me is Lynley's relationship with Daidre and their conversations about where things are going. This fell flat. Daidre's character is not as beautifully developed and drawn as other characters. She feels two-dimensional. We only know her through Thomas. What motivates her? I'm rooting for them, but right now, they are annoying more than interesting or sad. There were also some issues near the end of the book where some character's behavior was not believable when it was meant to be. It lacked George's usual finesse. Still, most of the characters, including new ones, are richly developed and the emotional connection to the reader is deep. George gives us plenty of twists in the plot so that we're just not sure what anyone believes. In reading this book, George educates us about so much and yet it's always part of a fascinating story and so you read hundreds of pages in two days and then try to do her justice in a review. Highly recommend!",4.0,1,2022
Good read!,"This was a really good story - a little confusing to me at first but, as I read further, it all shook out.  The one thing I was unhappy about was WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PIT BULLS!

classic fare for a romance novel,"The strengths of the story were the descriptive words and the effort taken to promote passion in the characters. I'm also grateful it wasn't a bodice ripper. It is clean historical romance.<br />The distractions were in the lack of editing. Brother-in-law became “bother-in-law.” Althea became “Aletha.” Spacing issues between words and in paragraphs were awkward, and interfered with enjoyment of the story. The writer knows her way around a story. It just needs some fine tuning.",4.0,1,2022
Not one of my favorite books and then it got worse,"I know this book as lots of favorable reviews, but I just can't give it a good rating. I have read other books by this author and they were fine and readable. I just did not like this story. I just couldn't like the characters much. Xander I did like ok, but all the others were almost stereotypical. You had the womanizer best buddy/business partner, the sweet bartender who is also the best friend and mentor, and the nasty Dad who was a bad professor in Xander's past. I didn't buy into/connect to any of them except Xander. The confident Evie turned into some sort of whiny, dithering woman who is so close to her Dad she can't seriously date a man unless Daddy approves? At 28? Really? As another review said, ""the author's writing style is all over the place. Sometimes she uses contractions; sometimes she doesn't. It's not consistent. Who speaks like that, anyway, especially if they're supposed to be from San Diego? It is not fun to read things in that manner. It's better to try to keep it as real as possible. I don't know - I just found it distracting."" I agree totally. Alot of the dialog didn't sound real. I almost didn't bother to finish, but figured in for a penny (or $0), in for a pound. And then, it got worse. The cliffhanger. Now I feel alot of the book was just words to get to a novel length. And there was no end. So now I would either need to pay for Book 2 or not finish the story. I'm going with not finishing this tale.",1.0,0,2022
3.5 Vivi better not get a HEA Mateo stars rounded up,"I have conflicting emotions when it comes to this book. So I'm just gonna list what I loved/hated.<br /><br />Loved<br /><br />How hard Foster fought to get Talia back. When you learn what happened to force his hand 7 years ago you realize he really was in a lose/lose situation.<br /><br />Talia- I loved her character in general and how she didn't grant forgiveness to Foster or Vivi right away. That when Foster and Vivi friendship would turn borderline inappropriate she called him out on it.<br /><br />That Foster put up boundaries with Vivi and I actually believe he'll keep them .<br /><br />That Foster was celibate for the 7 years. He never slept with or kissed Vivi. They were just roommates and co-parents.<br /><br />That even at the end Talia wasn't friends with Vivi. She just had an amicable relationship with her when it involved Kandace. That rang true for me<br /><br />That we got to see that Foster and Talia are going to have a baby.<br /><br />Hated<br /><br />Vivi. Plain and simple, she's a witch.  While Foster had no choice 7 years ago, she totally did. She had other options but chose to betray and break her best friends heart. Her reasonings were not good enough IMO and I don't think she's redeemed.<br /><br />Foster and Vivi close friendship. It took forever for him to set up boundaries. I mean he's moving to another state to win back the love of his life...yet he thinks he can still talk about intimate things and be best friends with his ex wife. After their betrayal to Talia I really didn't like that. Plus it took Talia pointing it out for him to be like Your right, it's habit that has to change.<br /><br />Foster was blackmailed into marrying Vivi by her dad. To then ask him to throw a fight because her fiancé made a bad bet straight up pi$$ed me off. Foster offered her the money, yet she didn't want to hurt Dex's pride by taking it so she asked Foster to lose. WTF was that?! How selfish can she really be? The only good side to this plot is Foster and Vivi's friendship is irrevocably damaged IMO.<br /><br />Lyla she's a witch and a bad sister. On the day Talia is blindsided with the fact Foster has a child, she has the nerve to say it's good he's he here because he's breaking her our of her emotional shell. WTF was that?!  Instead of comforting her obviously heartbroken sister she insults her. AND SHE  NEVER APOLOGIZES! Talia is a private person and doesn't like to broadcast her struggles, I didn't see this as a bad thing.<br /><br />So all in all I enjoyed the book but also felt like something was missing.

Micha and Sofie,"Claiming Starlight is the latest release from Isoellen and unfortunately it was a miss for me. I didn't like this book at all. I don't know what it is about this author, because I love her 12 Sectors series but everything else that I have read falls flat to me. There is absolutely no connection between Micha and Sofie. She barely speaks to him for the entire book, most of her dialogue occurs in her head. The two times they were intimate also did nothing for me.

Before I waste money, I'd like to know if the sexual orientation the characters is a huge part of the story. Let everyone like what they like but let's not be sly & covert about it when the plot of a story is heavy with one world view agenda. Additionally, it seemed like there was more time spent talking about the woke agenda than there was filling in the several holes in the story. Things are suddenly resolved with very little detail. it felt like there were paragraphs, if not pages, missing. I loved the metal magic but never really felt like the necromancer really did anything much at all with his talents. Not sure why it was  supposed to be interesting for the father to be getting it on with another guy IN THE LIVINGROOM -(you opened the door to the house there they were in the ""all together"").

The Rendition We've Always Needed,"Ooh this was so good. SO good!!!! Just like Ms. Stradling, I despise the original Grimm version of King Thrushbeard. The original tale is chock full of problems, and yet has many captivating aspects and intriguing concepts one desires to see retold! As a result, I have been an avid aficionado of King Thrushbeard retellings for decades. I've read countless versions of the tale, and while I love and adore many of them, I had yet to find a version where the heroine/princess/main female protagonist is, well,...good. Very much NOT in the wrong for anything that happens to her, and not a girl who is  spoiled/cruel/selfish/some other negative trait. That is of course, I had not come across a retelling with such a character  l until I picked up Ms. Stradling's The Maid and the Minstrel. Rosalind is so incredibly and refreshingly pure-hearted, and the story recognizes this and elevates her to a character that we readers need and want to see succeed, right from the very beginning. Philip, too, is also a breath of fresh air: he is just as full of integrity and love and compassion, and the combination of these two dynamic (and again, good!) characters makes it all but impossible to put the book down, a sort of intensity taking over as we readers desperately and fervently need to see them receive a happily ever after. I was charmed, moved, and completely invested in this story from the first moment, and it now lives among the shining ranks of my favorite King Thrushbeard retellings. It fixes all the issues with the original tale and puts in place a beautifully woven story filled with surprisingly relatable emotions and desires.  What a fantastic novella, and what a deeply wonderful experience it was reading. Bravo Ms. Stradling, this reader cannot wait to see what you write next!",5.0,1,2022
Just generated a hero that I couldn't like,"This tale was clearly set up with the orphan kid who stumbles on great power.  We're supposed to feel some sympathy for him because he's a orphan in a city that hates him, and that clearly is supposed to fix the fact that he's just not a good character.<br /><br />But that's just it.  The hero here proved easy to hold in disdain, but not easy to like.  I didn't want to read about him.  I wanted to pay attention to his learning skills even less.  Mostly because he was so selfish about it that I couldn't support him.<br /><br />And with a character I disliked, the rest of the story was hard to get through.  Its not terrible, but I couldn't call this a true cultivation novel.  Honestly, this is a low 3 star.",3.0,0,2022
Another good book from the line up,"The Conflict Thesaurus: A Writer's Guide to Obstacles, Adversaries, and Inner Struggles is not my first book from this series; I use them to help me develop characters and plot ideas. So far I’ve found the series to be very helpful. I prefer to spend time sitting and reading the book, getting ideas, but more confirming or deepening my understanding of behaviors. One way I develop ideas is to watch films I like (and usually know well) picking apart characters in order to figure out their layers (need, want, background, familiar interaction, character traits, strengths and weaknesses), but then pull out one of the Thesaurus versions to help fill in the blanks. For me the help comes up front when planning, or during, to confirm a detail or elements of behavior and action that pertain to something. So when I decided to get this The Conflict Thesaurus: A Writer's Guide to Obstacles, Adversaries, and Inner Struggles I knew what I was in for and was happy with another addition to my resource collection. So far this conflict version has given me more ideas or deeper knowledge of a topic.<br /><br />In this case, it is the first of the series I got in a Kindle Version. The jury is still out on how much I like it or not. Part of that issue for me is my Kindle is a Paperwhite and I’m not as happy with this set up and design of the Kindle as I have been on regular versions - it is not as user friendly in my opinion and that carries over into how it works with various types of books. In this case, the The Conflict Thesaurus: A Writer's Guide to Obstacles, Adversaries, and Inner Struggles is a bit more difficult to work my way through or quickly jump to something for a reference. I THINK I’m going to mark pages for things that catch my eye and HOPE I can jump to that page quicker. So in this case, the method of use is more hindrance than help. I find because of it that I really prefer the old school book version of the series. SO much easier to jump around.<br /><br />But the same set up is here: giving the topic: EXAMPLE: Causing a Workplace Hazard), then Examples, Minor Complications, Potentially Disastrous Results, Resulting Emotions, Possible Internal Struggles, Negative Traits that may worsen the situation, and so forth. This allows you to look up a topic and really dig into the components that make the person deeper and more enriched for your character development.<br /><br />I’ve always liked the books, like this one, just not the delivery method - which MAY be better if and when I get into a better Kindle version - and overall will use it often. Yes, I like this The Conflict Thesaurus: A Writer's Guide to Obstacles, Adversaries, and Inner Struggles and will always look at other options in the series.",5.0,1,2022

This fit the bill.<br />I also must honestly add that what was constantly off-putting was the poor attention to grammar and sentence structure. The author clearly needs an editor. Major historical events like wars are capitalized, i.e. the Civil War. Sentence structure is predictable. Author needs to vary her sentence structure and style. Improvement is greatly needed in these areas. Writing classes and professional editing are highly recommended.",3.0,0,2022

Worth the wait,"I first interviewed Fr. Sirico for my radio show almost eight years ago.

Well, I did have to wait but was it ever worth it. This book is fantastic.<br /><br />Father clearly calls on his mastery of homiletics and provides the reader with deep background and insights about the baker's dozen parables he chose to include in this volume. As if that were not enough, he adds a final chapter, the longest in the book, on some of his broader thoughts on economics and the new testament. Note this use of ""and"" the NT not, ""in"" the NT. Fr. Sirico is not deriving economic theory from the parables, but rather as he puts it, ""to detect the universal economic assumptions at play within the stories themselves, while at the same time acknowledging that these assumptions are not themselves the core intent, moral, or goal of the parable, and that, from time to time, Jesus turns such assumptions on their head to make his point.""<br /><br />Indeed, he has done this masterfully.<br /><br />If you are an entrepreneur, buy this book for yourself.

I think I'm done,"After this last book I'm left trying to decide if I want to continue this series, I am surprised I gave it this long to begin with. The first book started out so strongly. However it started to decline with the second book but I still felt it had hope since the author's description says Alex never had a meaningful relationship in his last life so he was going to give him one in this life.<br />  I wasnt a fan of the multiple relationships and felt it took alway from the main story but again I was given hope with the authors words for the third book claiming that after it the focus would be less on the harem and more on the plot. That didnt happen instead we have had an ever growing harem of flat characters.<br /> To me it seems that the author either has no real plan for this series or he was just flat out lying to his fans in order to get them to continue to read these books.<br /> It's gotten to the point that short of killing off some of the npc girlfriends and using it as some form of motivation or dark character building for the mc I dont see a way forward for this series. All the characters are too flat and repetive. None of them are memorable except for their political positions in the world or their race which just feels wrong.<br />Instead of the mc having meaningful relationships his entire dating life is just used as a joke.",1.0,0,2022
"Of thousands (literally), this may be my most highlighted Kindle book.","It's bittersweet reading the words of such a great American thinker and knowing that they were among his last. I have always admired Codevilla's writing. Once I discovered him, I tried to read everything he had written. I believe this book identifies when and where America's promise began diverging radically from the visions of the founders, leading to today, when we live in a country our founders would not recognize. I converted to Kindle early on because I am an inveterate highlighter and Post-It flagger, to the point that my library began to look comical. Kindle enabled me to engage in this practice without the disorder, and with searchable results. Kindle was born for me. That said, this last work of Angelo Codevilla will turn out to be my MOST highlighted and annotated book, among thousands. Reading Codevilla's work always makes one hungry for more. Alas, there will be no more, but what a legacy! If you've wondered how we got from ""there"" to ""here"", how a grand vision was perverted by Prog Lilliputians, it's all here.

well-written account of gripping scientific journey,"There's a bit of memoiristic background about Mersini-Houghton's growing up in Albania, but it doesn't take her long to get rolling on the gripping story of why and how she came to challenge both Penrose's ""our universe is highly improbable"" view and the anthropic principle. Along the way she does an excellent job of filling in the history of physics (Boltzmann, Maxwell, Einstein, Bohr, Planck, Heisenberg, Schroedinger, de Broglie, Wheeler, et al.) that came before. Once she gets into how she came to apply quantum mechanics to develop a way multiple possible universes could've arisen across the ""landscape"" of string theory, I was so excited, I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I very much admire how Mersini-Houghton  recruited other scientists to collaborate with, how she took detours into other branches of physics to shore up her knowledge, how she stepped back from her work at a few points to pursue alternative hypotheses even when she thought they'd probably be dead ends, how after formulating her theory she immediately went about looking for empirical proof—just WOW.<br /><br />If you love reading about science, you'll love this book!",5.0,1,2022
"Lots of swearing, otherwise, what a romp","The name is Flynn, James Flynn. What a romp. James, a patient at a mental hospital, thinks he's the next James Bond, agent of His Majesty. Escaping his confines, he manages to get into all kinds of adventures, many deadly situations he manages (by accident) to survive, including a mobster's grand plan. Exciting car chases. Amazing escapes. Heroic actions. Humor. This novel has it all.<br /><br />Flynn is a character. Orphaned young, bullied, he grew up on James Bond movies and the like.

Flynn says of himself and his sidekicks, “The fate of the world is in our hands.” (2948/5474)<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about this novel was the language. There is more swearing and gross comments in this novel than I never want to read. They are appropriate to the characters, however.

Nothing happens. Entire book is filler.,"This is supposed to be a slice of life Isekai story, I get it. But literally nothing happens. The party goes out into the woods and kills a boar.

Witness Protection Can Be Hazardous,"Have you ever considered what it would be like for your family to be shuttled into the Federal Witness Protection Program with no warning?  Unfortunately for them, the Bennetts found out after a botched carjacking involving powerful gangsters.  Two people lost their lives, and the crooks blamed the Bennetts for the death of the head mobster's son.  This book is a fascinating story of both loyalty and betrayal on so many levels.  The pacing of the book is somewhat uneven.  After starting with a bang (actually two bangs), the next chapters slogged along as the Bennetts (minus one) tried to adjust to life with no contact with family or friends.  Their sudden disappearance was so uncharacteristic that rumors spread that Mr. Bennett had killed his entire family and committed other crimes of arson. In ""What Happened to the Bennetts?"", author Lisa Scottoline provides many characters to root for and against.  My favorite characters were Mr. Bennett and Dom, an FBI agent assigned to protect the family.  The pace of the book picked up rapidly and sped to a satisfying conclusion once Mr. Bennett decided that WITSEC was not for him and went AWOL. Surprising alliances developed. Overall, I considered this a really good read.",4.0,1,2022
Flimsy Like Toilet Paper,"Not sure what I expected.  Hoping for insight into the contradictions seen in religion.<br />The author is a former evangelical preacher of 20 years.  He has rejected this approach due to its ""White, racist and homophobic interpretation of scriptures.<br />It is written as a series of mini-sermons.  They follow a uniform pattern:  ""You won't hear this in church.""  None specific platitudes, and closes with ""Grace is brave.  Be brave.""  But there is no explanation of the underpinnings of the ideas or what that it all means in action. (He even reference Ted Lasso.)<br /><br />While the author observes the flaws in aspects of evangelical Christianity, he offers little else of substance.<br /><br />He believes in a ""grace"" theology that is probably borrowed from Augustine and many Protestant theologians, he does not explain what led him to that interpretation.<br /><br />He notes the problems with interpretation of the writings of the New Testament Bible, as it was in Greek and the precise meanings of words is often unknown.  He mentions his believe that the word translated to condemn homosexuality is a mistranslation of the word for pedophilia.  But he provides no details.  If one recognizes what the precise meaning of a multi-translated text, written 30-150 years after the main character lived, may be hard to decipher,  one needs a set of guides by which to mine the true portions.<br /><br />He rejects the righteous, condemning deity and highlights the deity of love but again does not account for why the righteous deity seems to predominate the writings of Christianity.  He offers no explanation for the suffering of humanity other than the right wing Evangelicals.  He applies his ideas to nowhere but Western, particularly US, experience.<br /><br />Perhaps it is due to the chosen small length of these sermons, but it is hard to follow let alone analyze the value of the ideas.

"Meh. It’s alright. (FYI, it’s a, “romantic suspense” book, sans suspense.)","4 Stars is generous … and that’s just because I finished the story, so that must mean something. ??<br />*I* also got the genre wrong, so that’s on me. More on that below.<br />Plus, it takes place on the sea. 1/2 Star just for that.<br />And - this is my SECOND try after only making it through 50% the 1st time & giving up due to the hum-drums.<br />So what makes it a slow ship to Dullsville?<br />As other reviewers have noted - the traumatic backstories of Every. Single. Character. …… doesn’t help.<br />It’s not just their similarities of having past trauma that’s so much the issue, however. It’d be ok if mentioned, or briefly reviewed. But, it’s not. It’s discussed, or thought about - actively - in each character’s scenes. Repetitively.<br />I’d even go as far as to say that for some characters, there’s perhaps even MORE repeated past (over & over ….) than anything “fresh.”<br />Just the same old, “when I was 8 & kidnapped…” or “every time my grandmama drank a bottle of tequila in the swamps & started wrestlin’ them gators…” &, “I’m the worst mother in the world….”<br />Urgh. I have these people’s “lines” memorized after reading this book.<br />Lastly, it just sort of … plods along, in pacing. Don’t have to worry about reading late into the night with this book, or any of that heady anticipation! Nope.<br />Just chugs along at a slow pace, to add to the painful repetitive inner thoughts of the characters.<br />Although, to be fair, I did just read the bio of the author and have a clearer understanding of her writing style. As well as my (unfounded) expectations.<br />I am a decade-long, diehard, 3-5 book/week, reader of the apocalypse genre. Plus military, war, science, medicine, murder mystery, sci-fi, ….. basically very super-charged, action packed, adrenaline fueled, often chock-full of facts & research, reading.<br />And never does a romance, nor a “happily ever after” book intentionally land in my lap.<br />Had I known this was a, “romantic suspense” (errr… sans the suspense?) story, I never would have begun. Twice. Lol<br />But at least now I understand why it reads the way it does.<br />I DO have to commend the author for all of her use of “swear words” (i.e., REAL TALK) which would occur between adults in such situations. Nothing is as aggravating as when adult books are written in, “aw jolly gee my foot just got blown off!” language. It pulls you right out of the story with the absolute unbelievably of it.<br />And her use of emotional language is perfectly on point. You know EXACTLY what every one of these passengers are going through on all levels; physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, etc…<br />The author’s world building is pretty solid. I can really “see” it all in rich detail. Even in the pitch blackness. The only issue, again, is quite a bit of unneeded repetition. I only need to be shown that the upper jogging track has been utterly ripped out, & what is left behind - oh, maybe just once or THREE TIMES TOPS! lol<br />I AM going to start Book 2. Just because the characters are still on the sea.<br />But if we leave the sea …. &/or the storyline is just a long continuation of regurgitating “the traumas of the past,” I’m out.<br />I’m ALREADY bored, just thinking about it ….<br />Just SOME action … please….<br />Fingers crossed!

Needs to focus more on the romance,"Characters: Ricki and Mike<br />Spice rating: 0 out of 5 (this is a clean romance, there were no intimate scenes)<br /><br />Okay I was intrigued with this book because I saw it got a ton of hate, so I decided to check it out for myself and see what the fuss was about.<br /><br />This isn’t usually the type of books I read (I hate politics in romances) and this one I knew would trigger Trump haters especially.<br /><br />I would say that this book had people who were stuck in their political beliefs and they pre-judged the other side. I’m more middle of the road, so I’ve seen both sides get really nasty with each other, etc. To me no matter what political party you side with, there will always be bad apples in the group who try to corrupt everyone around them.<br /><br />Ricki is a far left feminist who believes in her views, and she decides to go to a Trump rally to basically prove that Trump and his supporters are racists, but she comes to find out that what she believes in is wrong. A Trump supporter saves her from anti-fascist’s and the rest starts from there.<br /><br />I ultimately gave this book a 3 star because I felt that Ricki changed her politics WAY too quickly, usually the people who have been “red pilled” it takes them time to come to terms with their beliefs being different. Politics are very similar to religion, when you start to question things it takes time to change your way of thinking to what you have been taught for years into believing was true. She went from a far left leaning feminist, to a conservative female basically overnight.<br /><br />I liked Mike, but there were things that annoyed me with his character, he thought women were delicate (dude we ain’t 😂), I liked his protective instincts with her, but something I ended up telling my boyfriend when we first met is to stop treating me like I’m made of glass. Women are different than men of course, but we won’t break if a stiff wind hits us. I mean we are made to carry and give birth to babies, so we are stronger than some men think.<br />Also I know that his religious and family beliefs were more old school, but saying women with tattoos is gross was something he should have kept to himself. God gives you free will, so if you want to decorate your body then it’s up to you.<br /><br />As for the romance, there really wasn’t much in here for me to even call it a romance, it was more politically driven than romantically. Also I felt like they “fell in love” way too quickly.",3.0,0,2022
Seriously???,"***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />I’m so freaking annoyed by this book. The first one was great, there was a puzzle to figure out and we learned about the world. I loved the two mains and their push/pull relationship.<br /><br />This book is not that. The two characters spend most of it apart. Rowan finds out who her parents were and that she’s destined to kill the king. She literally trains a year in the underworld so she’s strong enough to fight Orion and win the crown.<br /><br />I’m at 91% and I’m not finishing. Why? Because after all that, she loses because she needed to fly somewhere to have a huge spectacle to kill the king. Push him off the balcony! Kill him mid-flight! She has him down, seriously rip his heart out! But no, everything done in this book is wasted as Orion swoops in and does what she should have in half a second. What was even the point of this book? Honestly you could read the last 5 chapters of this after book one and miss absolutely nothing! It was pointless. No relationship building, no character growth, just a huge waste of time (for the characters and for me). I stopped reading when she’s right back where both books started, with her moping about in the human world.

The story has poor flow, is mostly written in choppy short sentences, and the characters acted in ways no real human would, which took away from the plot believability and my enjoyment.

Strange and broken man becomes a professor,"I liked this story enough to consider it a low 4 star tale.  The main character is broken enough to be interesting while not being so broken that it turned me off.  We get hints that he's an extremely skilled wizard, but that he also struggles with having enough power to do anything, and only a lifetime of intense study has made him into the master archmage he is today.<br /><br />and there are many hints that he's far more powerful, but that something in his past left him with permanent regrets.<br /><br />Into this world his friends force him to start teaching a small group of difficult students in the local mage academy.  And this tale is the development of his relations to his students while forces unseen cause trouble and plot some great betrayal.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit uneven, and I think the author was a bit too enamored with his secrets about the main character and the events that destroyed his confidence.  But I still got into the tale and wanted to know what was going to happen next.  This was a worthy first book in a series.",4.0,1,2022
Not worth the slog,"This is a very low 3 star book.  I won't punish it by giving it less as I think some people might be impressed by the long lists of equipment and the brisk pace of the overall plot.  James Haddock is not a bad writer and his prose is relatively easy to read.<br /><br />** Warning my review will spoil the book, but I feel its necessary to explain my rating **<br /><br />Where I had issues with this book was the complete lack of character development.  This story is about a young man who was out salvaging a battlefield with his father when his father is murdered.  He organizes a group to go back and salvage the battlefield, but is betrayed.  He sneaks away with some of the equipment and starts a 3rd salvaging group, but they are wiped out while he's recovering from surgery.  So he starts a 4th group, but then leaves them for ""reasons"".<br /><br />If you can't tell, this tale doesn't take the time to develop any characters.  The main character is the only constant and he's largely a passive cypher who the plot swirls around.  Yes, there is some great conspiracy that keeps trying to take him out, even though he isn't actively trying to hinder it.  Yes, he does gain allies, but they just use him and force him to constantly move on.<br /><br />For me this was a hard slog of a read.  I didn't care for the main character, and I disliked just about everyone he encountered due to them being redshirts rather than fully fleshed out characters who mattered.  It also led to a tale that lacked any guidance as to where it wanted to go.  The main character seemed to be at a battlefield salvaging, or in a town hiring and preparing for his next journey to a battlefield.<br /><br />So, I don't really recommend this one, but again, it's not terrible.  Just had too much about all the equipment while forgetting a story needs to be about characters interacting with the world around them in interesting ways.  Here there weren't really much in the way of characters and their interactions were boring at best.",3.0,0,2022

There were serious moments of cringe between the laughs.  I don't know that that's your typical book review, but it seems appropriate in this case since the book is the author inviting you into her life and sharing her thoughts and experiences.  I didn't like her. I never found her endearing, thought I hoped I would, especially toward the end, but I just never got there.

Mixed Feelings on This One,"I love historical fiction.  I love reading about the Civil War era as well as the WWII era.  I love good writing.  So I have to point out that the writing quality in this book is not.quite.there.  Perhaps it’s inferior editing, perhaps it’s a lack of research.  Whatever the reason, I found it distracting.  The dialect of the Negro slaves was very inconsistent. We could go from “dis an dat” to “these and those” in the same sentence.  And there were places where language was simply misused, as when Robert introduced his “buddy from college.”  I could be wrong, but I don’t think “buddy” was a term used in the 1860s. Then we had the clothing of the wealthy antebellum daughter of the plantation.  Remember, these were the days of tightly laced corsets and hoop skirts.  And yet Miss Carrie left for a Tournament and Ball at a neighboring plantation, withOUT her personal slave, because she could dress and undress herself.  Sorry, couldn’t be done.  I also can’t imagine how Carrie managed to ride her horse (side saddle no less, since ladies of the era did not ride astride) in a hoop skirt, but evidently she did.  All this is very disappointing, because the story is interesting, the characters are likable (the ones we are supposed to like).  So if details like that don’t bother you, go for it!

American needs an edititor/proof reader in the worst possible way! Off the top, there are organizational issues. Often, there are no transitions between scenes and events leaving the reader (me) floundering. There are many mispellings (giger counter, anyone?). Character names: Who is Ashley? I finally figured out that Ashley is ""Little Bit's"" given name but that is never explained. At one point, Janet is called ""Janice."" There are other instances of characters' names getting messed up. I did NOT like how the  book ended--AT ALL! Fred is in childbirth, and one baby is born but we don't know the fate of the second baby because the book abruptly ends. We are teased about a new DOD mission in Morgan's back yard but again the book just ends. The book ends in mid-paragraph, absolutely no closure, and I don't like that. I just hate cliff-hangers! So why did I give this book five stars? The answer is, mostly because the book is so readable with good well-fleshed characters and a good plot. The issues I mentioned above are annoying and they do take away from the reading experience, no question and the cliff hanger was NOT artful in any sense of the word. But it WAS a good read, hence the number of stars.",5.0,1,2022
This is a wild ride of a book. Possible spoilers,"I received this book for free for review.<br /><br />If you've ever wondered what it was like to have your psyche yanked from place to place without any real rhyme or reason, this book answers that question. While that may sound distinctly unfun, the whole point of this book is a fun examination of some really crazy stuff. It will give you whiplash.<br /><br />If sci-fi is your wheelhouse, then you need to read this book.<br />If you like solving mysteries, this is a great book to read.<br />If you enjoy diving into really messed up reality--this is a must read.<br /><br />I enjoyed everything about this book, got caught up in it, and read into the wee hours.",5.0,1,2022
A Disappointment,"I've read two of Hannah's books--the Nightengale and Four Winds--and can't believe this dumb book is by the same author. It's just full of cliches, melodrama, implausible events. Lots of hand-wringing and soul-searching and tears. A bore! Read ""Four Winds"" instead.",1.0,0,2022
Bored,"I was utterly bored by this books about eons of obsession by the two main characters and the author failed to make me care about them or their story. I honestly don’t know what book the other reviewers read/listened to, to garner those stars. There was no romantic spark between Alexander and Zani, no grand passion that I felt. I was told about it but was never pulled into the story by it. Singh has written about how angels had fallen in love in the past, so I know she can actually pull it off. In this book she had two angels that don’t really interact but love each other. The book started with young Alexander and seemed good, but then sank a few chapters in. I think Singh is mentally done with the series as I don’t see the spark in her writing, or the passion for her characters. Both Zani and Alexander despite being thousands of years old were petulant children. Not even Justine Eyre’s fabulous narration could pull this book out of the dumpster fire. I have never been so disappointed in a book or an author.  Singh had been a pre-order author for a long time, but I won’t be fooled again. I wish I could say the book was mediocre, but in reality it is just bad.",1.0,0,2022
Great Danes.  Proceed with caution.,"Great Danes.  Proceed with caution.  You may experience sheer happiness and extreme love.  You could develop Dane Brain as well which will cause your life to revolve around Danes.  There is no cure. ~ Author Unknown<br /><br />Well, after all, she told him to practice:  Fitzwilliam Darcy cleared his throat and regarded his reflection in the mirror. Lifting his chin, his posture exuding supreme confidence (but which had maddeningly failed to mollify his nerves since his arrival at Rosings), he practiced once again. “I trust your family is in good health?”<br /><br />And practice he does.  He believes he is ready to approach the object of his affection.  He is at the parsonage when disaster strikes in the person of a Great Dane puppy.<br /><br />Any man who hates babies and dogs can’t be all bad. ~ Leo Rosten<br /><br />How about a man who hates baby dogs?  Elizabeth Bennet certainly believes he is all — or mostly — bad.  She has no knowledge of his Great Dane experience.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  Darcy seethed, “He tore into my… flesh.” He observed the grin creeping up Richard’s face and knew he had swallowed his cousin’s bait. Blast the infernal man.<br />“And you still have the scar, I presume, to prove it!” Richard guffawed like a ninnyhammer. “Pray do not show me, I beg you.”<br />As if Darcy would.<br />“Perhaps I shall mention the incident at dinner. See how Mr. Collins pontificates on the merits of turning the other cheek.”<br /><br />Things that upset a Terrier may pass virtually unnoticed by a Great Dane. ~ Smiley Blanton<br /><br />The proposal does not happen but Darcy is forced to rescue the naughty pup.  The things that man will do for the woman he loves!<br /><br />I always enjoy a peek at the relationship between a gentleman and his gentleman’s gentleman.  Chalmers is up for a few good chortles:  Chalmers leaned in — loyal eavesdropping spy that he was.<br /><br />Some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses. ~ Elizabeth Taylor<br /><br />I loved this light-hearted, charming story.  I recommend it, even if you don’t like dogs.<br /><br />The author gave me an early copy of this book with no promise of a review.<br /><br />Great Danes:  too big to take offense and too noble to give it. ~ Author Unknown",5.0,1,2022
Engaging story and characters,"This is an interesting police procedural set in Mumbai, India.  It is well-written with believable characters. The editing was professional, without distracting misuse of words and punctuation. Overall, the Indian words were described well enough to grasp their meaning and gave the book flavor.

Dr. Ham and his staff work on improvements and together they come up with the perfect food.  What is it?<br /><br />I loved this book!  Scout is so adorable.

"Same great series, characters and a few shortcomings","I love this series, have read every one and may continue to do so. The characters in this book are eccentric and developed, the location fun, and the backdrop puts you in the historical setting! I even loved that Wallis Simpson come to bat for Georgie several times and Belinda is really maturing!<br /><br />I don’t care what characters show up or the location-that’s Bowen’s choice. What is getting old is that as soon as they got married, no more sizzle or time together. Very frustrating as this is a big piece of this series. Also Georgie’s lack of good clothing considering all her rich friends and Mummy who make offers. It’s not cute anymore. Please show that married couples can continue a series. Others have successfully done it and Darcey is so developed it’s a shame to not see this side/more of him.",4.0,1,2022
Not what I was expecting,"I read this based on the author’s preview on booktok, and I’ve realized how rarely that works out. Here I was expecting an alpha male tattooed boss being seduced by a younger flirty girl. Instead, it was a deadbeat 31 year old who is constantly facing eviction for a crap business model (“we need money but should tell every potential client it’s on the house or to get out of the tattoo parlor altogether”) being seduced by a brat who wants to be treated as an adult while constantly acting immature (“oh yes, I’m an adult, watch me kick the partition in the cop car” or “don’t treat me as a child as I purposely try to wreck a motorcycle with both of us on it”). Both of these two come from bad backgrounds, but it didn’t give me enough to root for either one. Honestly, regardless of the ending, I don’t see a happier ever after for these two.<br /><br />That was enough to make it a DNF for me, but add on top that the author found it really impactful to repeat the same sentence three times in a row over and over again. “It’s me. It’s me. It’s me” literally just like that. I don’t know if it was supposed to be artistic or what, but it was obnoxious and immediately knocked me out of the story. 2 stars only because it seemed well edited.",2.0,0,2022
Books need a rating system,"1.  I did not even remember how I received this book last night when I realized I would not be finishing it and promptly deleted it from my e-reader. I thought maybe it was a Kindle First Reads book that I had forgotten about--I had just finished a really good book and was not ready to turn out the light, so I went into my Cloud to see what was there and thought, ""oh!  I love the ocean and stories where travel happens, etc""... This morning I vaguely remembered some kind of ""huzzah! You have received a free book because you made a Kindle first reads purchase"" message recently. Ok...surely it is a book that I might actually choose, then...but nope.<br />2.  Spoiler alert-- I did not sign up for a book about a lesbian affair.  To the author's defense, I am sure that it is well-written and that the meaning behind it is much more than just a physical relationship between 2 women---but that is most definitely what slaps you in the face at some point in the book, and if you are unprepared and did not choose that theme, it is going to be surprising, if not jarring. IT could have just as easily gone to a storyline in which the women become friends, though perhaps unrealistic--many books are.  It's called escapism (but I wanted to escape from the book itself).<br /><br />Here's the deal:  Setting aside anyone's preferences or beliefs, this could be a polarizing theme.  This type of book is not something that should just be ""gifted"" to consumers without some kind of rating system or preface that clues them in BEFORE they accept it.  If you want to sell books, if you want good ratings, you need to be sure that your books go in the hands of the consumers who will appreciate them.  In the case of marketing books, an author is no longer just the writer, but someone who is going to need to be a part of the marketing process, I am sorry to say, or the result is like this---the lower star reviews on here are from people who would not have chosen this book had they been more well-informed...and it is going to lower the ratings and affect the author. But guess what? That is a part of the author's job in this digital world, which is why this review is still relevant.<br />Wouldn't mind having those minutes of sleep back instead, but that's my bad.  What ISN'T my bad, was opening a book that was free-to-me based on being a consistent consumer, assuming it would be a book that I might choose, even based on the description (because like I said, it could have gone various ways), only to find a theme I would not have been interested in reading.<br /><br />Safe to say that I will probably not read another of this author's books based on this introductory experience, and that I will not be trusting when Amazon ""offers"" me books anymore.",1.0,0,2022
Very Slow Ex Navy Seal Romance,Adam is an ex-navy seal who owns a security company and pins for the one who got away. Maila (who is also named Emmy (which is weird) gets taken and Adam comes to rescue her.

"Happy I read it for book club, but not enough to highly recommend","Just read this for my book club. It had some touching parts and I enjoyed reading and learning about Korean food and some cultural aspects. In fact it inspired me to get a new (better quality) rice cooker. But, overall, it wasn't a real ""page turner"" and I just didn't feel there was enough of a unique story line to justify a memoir at this point in the author's life. I think we will have some interesting points to discuss, but I am not recommending it to friends as a general read.",3.0,0,2022
"continued hilarity, just love this series","I am up to date with the story, and really enjoyed everything I read. I dont rehash what I read (not a book report here), but just my overall impression. Fun thing about reading, what we choose and enjoy is highly subjective. Something you love, I may fine stupid. Something I love you may not be able to handle. Whatever. Give something a try and move on.<br /><br />The Levelling Up series was not something I expected to like. I had learned of this book on a random FB sponsored ad. I dont recall what drew me to it, but let me tell you none of this is my typical genre to read from. I think it was the appeal of reading of a character in her 40s. I'm in my 40s. Nice to see the main star to be someone outside the typical 20 something. Figured I'd give it a go, and if I didnt like it I have the option to stop, yes?<br /><br />The first chapter was meh. Though, I tend to be a little snarfy when I first begin a new book. Takes a little to get into it. But then once it started rolling, I was so very much hooked. I think once I realized that the writer can write, can flesh out detail, can give life to not only main characters, but give a lot to side characters, and I can imagine the surroundings so well yet am not spoon fed all everything. I was impressed, and hoked. I cant get enough, I could read from this world forever more. Love the characters, all the fun quirky details, and the lovely boost to my imagination.<br /><br />If you aren't reading KF Breene, you should. Very funny, lots of wonderful side characters, and the main story has some meat. But I could read all about the Levelling Up world without any story line. I just LOVE hanging out with all the characters. Funny stuff, hot stuff, some feels. Not overlly dramatic. And not at all scary despite some freaky stuff going on.<br /><br />And yes, there are ridiculously hot guys in this, with cringey names (I suspect it is an intentional nod toward the lame romantic tripe of so called romance books). Stop clutching your pearls long enough to just enjoy this. It's a slow burn, and please feel free to enjoy it. OR dont pick up a fantasy (on many levels) book.<br /><br />If the details in this book freak you out, then you wont be able to handle the intense spice of some of her other work. Ruin of Roses, comes to mind. That is another incredible story with loads of detail, awesome side characters, but the heat is turned way way way up. Wowza. Well done.. mm hhmmm",5.0,1,2022
Average,"The book has two parts. The first part focuses on the science of the brain and what motivates it. The second part is the practical/applied part.<br />I enjoyed and learned a lot from the first part of the book. I got a little from the second part. There were some excellent points, but fewer than in the first part. I decided to read this book because it had a very high review on Amazon. However, it has only a 3.54 score on goodreads, which is more realistic.<br /><br />My rating system is as follows:<br />1 - I did not like the book at all.<br />3 - I learned something. But it did not significantly impact me, and I will not read it the second time.<br />5 - Huge impact on my life, view, and thinking. I could not stop thinking about this book. I will reread this book.<br /><br />I'm going to give this book three stars.",3.0,0,2022
Seph sure never expected to run into a dead body during her getaway,"NOTE: I read this when it had the previous cover design, but it doesn't look like any of the people who owned it switched over to the newer version. And none of the previous reviews came with it either, so here's mine again.<br /><br />I really enjoyed meeting Persephone or Seph as she goes by and her daughter Callie. Even though Callie was only heard from via phone or video calls, she seemed like a pretty awesome daughter. Poor Seph sure stepped into a nest of weirdos when she came to Zephyr, Maine when she was really seeking peace and quiet. The only normal creature there was Bella, the cat, lol. Neighbor Candace seemed ok though and way more normal than her always-angry father she lived with. I did also like Theresa from the farmer's stand and thought if Seph did stay around town, she'd make a good sidekick for solving murders with her.<br /><br />I had a feeling eventually about whodunit but it wasn't a whole lot sooner than when Seph figured it out, but by then it was too late. She really needed to use her head and stay alive. Bella ended up proving to be a handy weapon eventually. All was explained, then Seph was off to her next adventure at home or wherever life took her. I'm interested in borrowing the next on KU to see what kind of mystery she gets into next time. I'm sure Bella kitty might be happy to provided some more killer protection.",5.0,1,2022
Fun culinary cozy - much improved over last couple of installments in this series,"I have been reading this series from the beginning and it's hard to believe this is Book 28! Even though I enjoy this series so much, I have to admit being disappointed in the last couple of books.This book is much better than the last few books have been. The conversations, even between close friends and family, are still overly formal and stilted in places, but the annoying inner dialogue of Hannah's that took over the prior book is thankfully missing from this book. <br /><br />There is more substance to the book, as well. The mystery itself which is about an obnoxious fishing show host being murdered was interesting provided many suspects for Hannah to question. The resolution of the case made sense, but Mike's behavior during the investigation was off. There is an unexpected development at the very end, and I assume that cliffhanger will be addressed in the next book. No progress in the Hannah/Norman relationship in this book, but maybe next time? It's time for Hannah to move on from Ross and recognize the great guy that has always been there for her! <br /><br />For those who enjoy the culinary aspect of this series, there are plenty of recipes in this book ranging from breakfast dishes to desserts to appetizers. The earlier books of this series are still my favorites, but I enjoyed this book much more than the last several so I hope the series continues to be this entertaining. <br /><br />I received this ebook from NetGalley through the courtesy of Kensington Books. An advance copy was provided to me at no cost, but my review is voluntary and unbiased.",4.0,1,2022

Gregg Braden books are amazing!,What can I say? Gregg is a unique writer and has a natural innate ability to tap the surfaces of the unseen world. Gregg Braden is above all my absolute favorite writer. He will open your eyes to see incredible realities that our current societies are generally not aware of.<br />Fractal Time is my favorite book of Gregg’s. Quite interesting and very intriguing as well. I own several of his books. They are all very precious to me. Gregg has a deep soulful uniqueness and scholarly approach to his writings. In my opinion Gregg Braden is one of the most important writers of our time. If you haven’t read anything by Gregg Braden thus far… I recommend you get started.,5.0,1,2022

"some great elements, some problematic ones","Rating: 3.5🌈<br /><br />The Boy in the Locked Room is a good example of second book syndrome.  The first story sets the characters and world building. The second story needs to continue that momentum going, while further developing the storylines (if that’s the format the author’s chosen) as well as allowing for character growth.<br /><br />It definitely shouldn’t raise more issues than it does contribute towards a bettering a relationship with the characters and the series arc the author’s laying out.<br /><br />Which is my problem with The Boy in the Locked Room . See full list at the bottom.<br /><br />At the end of The Ghost in the Hall , a book I loved btw, the MC the medium, Edward Campion, had become paralyzed from the waist down, due to a battle with a evil spirit.<br /><br />Avery’s descriptions of Ward dealing with his long recovery, his disability and it’s very real impact on every aspect of his life is raw, filled with tears, darkness, and is absolutely believable.<br /><br />Ward isn’t thinking about the boy who needs saving. And still visits him nightly, albeit rarely  in the beginning of the book. Ward is rightfully concerned with his own personal issues.  His business, which is taking a hit because of his recovery.  He’s depressed and feeling too dependent on others, like his orc Professor boyfriend, Mason .  They’ve moved in together but even that’s feeling out of sync.  The adjustment isn’t going smoothly.<br /><br />This is where I’m conflicted because Avery does an incredible job with Ward in this situation , once having made the decision to injure Ward so severely in the story.  However, it now becomes so much a part of the current story that any other subjects or threads are relegated to a lesser narrative status.<br /><br />Including the boy in the locked room.<br /><br />What comes next in the  high percentage of scenes after the turmoil of Ward adjusting to his disability and new reality is his sex life. Or rather his and Mason’s.  This does dovetail into how both parties are relating to each other physically and emotionally after Ward’s trauma.<br /><br />But, there’s so many that just as we start with a scene or storyline that’s connected to Rayn, the tormented boy that’s dream walking, and crying out for help, it’s stopped.  And we’re back to yet  another sex scene.<br /><br />The entire subject of the book’s title is given very little space until the story is halfway finished which is a shame because the horror and mystery is a excellent idea, but truly not given the depth or details it needs.<br /><br />So where did the space go to?  Chapter 19.  A chapter the author themselves states, in a Dear Readers note within the book , can be skipped over because it includes,“an attempted sexual assault in Chapter 19. Readers who have survived similar experiences may be more comfortable skipping ahead to Chapter 20.”  Avery has written a raw, graphic scene that’s hard to read, where a vulnerable person is being sexually assaulted.  This includes a suspenseful build up as well as the scene itself.  It’s the entire chapter.<br /><br />This also includes a trip to the hospital, rape kit scene, and police investigation.  Raw and brutal, as it would be.<br /><br />There’s one impactful magical element that’s of note. It could be referenced or brought into this story another way outside of this chapter.<br /><br /> So my issue and question is, if a full chapter and entire major aspect of a plot and character storyline be skipped over, is it really necessary to begin with? Especially one that’s so traumatic, carries with it triggers, and deep emotional pain ?<br /><br />Was it just needed to bring that one magical development to light?<br /><br />That’s a chapter that could have been used to further the complicated history and horror that’s Rayn.  Or any of the other ghosts or families asking Ward and Mason for assistance.  Some including Sylvia are fantastic.<br /><br />And let’s not forget the fantastic elf Detective Hart.  His role here was enlarged, remarkable, and again makes me want a series just for him.<br /><br />So for me?  The Boy in the Locked Room (Beyond the Veil #2) by K.M. Avery suffered from :<br />- [x] too many sex scenes, which leads to<br />- [x] a lack of concentration on the actual title subject matter,<br />- [x] the fact it contains an entire chapter devoted to a brutal attempted sexual assault that the author said could be skipped . So is it really necessary?<br /><br />Final question.  If a book has wonderful characters, great ideas, and moments where it seems to come together but just didn’t because of every reason I just stated, would you be recommending it?<br /><br />I’ll leave you to decide the final answer.<br /><br />Beyond The Veil series:<br />- [x] The Ghost in the Hall #1<br />- [x] The Boy in the Locked Room #2<br />- [ ] The Skeleton Under the Stairs #3",3.0,0,2022
Good story about trees.,"This is a rhyming story about trees and why we need them. At the end was a list (with pictures) of 12 types of trees in the book that challenges the reader to find them in the story. This always annoys me. Why not give this challenge at the BEGINNING of the book so the reader can search while going through the book? Seems obvious to me, but apparently it isn't for everyone else. Anyway, the illustrations are great, and the information is presented in a fun way that children will appreciate.",4.0,1,2022
an excellent story…,"…in what’s now a terribly over-worked genre. What surprised me most about the book is Gregg’s choice to make the MC one of the professors, rather than a student. This allowed him to avoid all the usual pitfalls: there are no Mary Sues, no teenaged MCs with miraculous gifts adrift in a sea of hormones, no love triangles or reverse harems—in fact, so far there are no love interests at all (a huge relief as I’d begun thinking that difficult romance was always going to be central to these stories). So refreshing! Also it’s very well written, I liked the plot a great deal and now I really want to hear more about this Adventurers’ Guild and its exploits. On to book 2. . .",5.0,1,2022
ugh,"Grammar errors, mediocre writing. Although the cover stylistically seems similar to what readers see on books by the extremely talented, infamous, and prolific Stephen King, (author of The Stand, Carrie, It, and many other outstanding stories), don’t be fooled into thinking this is the same author! Not even close. A complete waste of money. Characters and story are not well developed—feels simplistic, lacking dimension.

"Definitely not a novel, almost a documentary.","This book is in my opinion impossible to categorize. It is a novel, almost. It is also a documentary, almost.<br />While it is also a story that is surprisingly beautiful. The story also brought tears to my eyes several times.<br />The ending of the story wasn’t rushed, however it seemed to me that everything before the ending was a prologue to the actual story that wasn’t told, if that somehow makes sense.<br />In other words there was so much more to the story that should have been told. It’s like you got just a taste of your favorite dessert before it was taken away forever.<br />Anyway I give very few 4* reviews but decided that this docustory deserved at least that and hope that you the next reader agrees with me.<br />And I’m repeating the “Epigrath” here -<br />(There will come a time when you believe everything is finished.

Hallmark Movie ... But make it black,"I like Tay as an author, but this book didn't have the edge that I have become accustomed to or that I love from her. While Grayson and Nova's love story was cute and sweet like a Hallmark movie, I wasn't blown away by them as characters. And while Sierra, who was the definition of a mature and uproblematic ""baby momma"" / ex constantly described Grayson as a great father, the fact that he missed or was late to almost everything his son did because of his photography seemed like his priorities were off.  Also, this book was unnecessarily long with no real action. Nova was so insecure it was irksome and became very juvenile. And if Tay wrote ""she tucked a piece of hair behind her ear"" one my freaking time, I was gonna grow my tablet. Shesh, get the girl a scrunchy or hair clip of something. I did love the family dynamics, all of them. And Monroe and My lab were hilarious. I also liked the update from Gave and Aisha. Overall, this could have been cut down to a Novella.",3.0,0,2022

2.5 stars - unfortunately disappointing,"I hate to rate a KA book so low, because she’s a favorite, but I’ve got to be honest here—The Girl in the Mist was disappointing.<br /><br />Before going into this, I’d imagined it would be more like the ‘Burg series. I really liked the ‘Burg series. Unfortunately, The Girl in the Mist was not like the ‘Burg series. Or if it was, it was closest to being like For You which is one of my absolute least favorite KA books so that’s not helping anything.<br /><br />Really I think my biggest issues with this book can be boiled down to a few things:<br /><br />- there was barely any real attention on the romance. I appreciated the maturity both Bohannan and Delphine approached their relationship with. But I also feel like their relationship was so lackluster on the page. They took time to progress, but we didn’t get to see a lot of it. We were just told they’d cuddled and talked for many nights while sleeping in separate rooms. And as they made steps forward in the relationship, it almost felt jarring because we hadn’t gotten to SEE them grow together all that much. Especially in the beginning, when their relationship first started. One day they didn’t know each other, and then the next Delphine was making dinner for his family and turning into a stand-in mother for Celeste.<br /><br />- there was A LOT of time spent on the drama of the town. Which made sense, considering how the story and mystery pans out. But the thing is that it made the story feel so slooooow. And it was disappointing to have more happy heart feelings about Ray and Shelly’s relationship that about Delphine and Bohannan’s. And everything was told in a clunky, info-dump way. Which I know is par for the course with KA and usually I’m entertained, but like I said—this time it felt slow and quite honestly bored me.<br /><br />- we got told a lot about the characters, but we didn’t really get to KNOW them. This surprised me because if there’s one thing KA excels at it’s bringing her characters to life. But in this one, I know Bohannan is a badass profiler and loves his kids and had a rocky upbringing. And I know Delphine had a neglectful mother and two marriages that went up in flames and has two daughters and was in a show once and now writes books. But as I read the book, I didn’t get a great feel for their personalities at all. Again, it was a lot of tell and not much show. One of them would say something, and then I’d need Delphine’s inner monologue to figure out the tone. I think this is wild considering KA has heroes that can just say “babe” and I know exactly what they mean. And don’t get me started on the next to zero time we got to know both of their children.<br /><br />So yeah, that sums up my biggest issues with The Girl in the Mist. That said, why 2.5 stars? Well, here’s the few things I did like:<br /><br />- Delphine’s mothering relationship with Celeste. It was sweet, and while it progressed out of nowhere (just like the romance) I liked it nonetheless.<br />- Bohannan’s sons. I really liked them. I wish we’d gotten to really know them better (and all the children, really! There’s no reason why we should not have considering After the Climb exists), but from what we got in this book they seem great.<br />- the maturity and stability in the romance. I wish we’d gotten more of the nitty gritty, but what we did get I did like. They were two people who knew what they wanted and committed to it without drama or hesitation. I love that.<br />- that Bohannan was nervous. It was cute.<br />- Delphine’s friendships with Megan and Kimmy.<br />- the atmosphere of the story. It FELT dark. The misty setting obviously helped, but the vibes of each chapter were really tense. Definitely fitting of the thriller feel KA was going for.<br />- the fact that even though the story felt slow, I did want to read all the way through. And the mystery solved was interesting. It took a loooooong time to get there, but when I got to it I didn’t skim a single word.<br /><br />And that’s all I’ve got to say for now. The Girl in the Mist was not great, in my opinion. It delivered on the thriller feel, but was told with a rather slow pace and not enough attention given to the romance.",2.0,0,2022
"A formulaic Fiona Grace mystery novel, a fluffy fun read","This is he first in a series of novels about Sicily and is almost an exact copy of the Tuscany Vineyard series first novel.  There is a ditzy female who is unhappy and mistreated in her job in the US who is really very smart and talented with little self esteem and decides on a moments notice to quit her job, leave her family and friends (such as they are) and move to Italy for a new life. She has no preparation and doesn't speak the language but apparently plans to succeed. As in the Tuscan Vineyard series, she meets helpful people who speak English and take her under their wing, but almost immediately upon arriving she discovers a murder and the police suspect her, confiscate her passport and confine her to town. She decides she has to solve the murder and almost magically finds a very tangential clue that identifies the previously completely undescribed murderer character. The murderer confesses to her and is going to kill her, but the police arrive in time, arrest him, and she is exonerated. She learns that the tiny crumbling house that she bought is connected to another house that is opulent, has a view, and she is now happy and fulfilled. If this were the first Fiona Grace novel that I had read, I would think it fluffy and unrealistic, but a fun novel with good action. The lack of novelty in setting up the characters and plot greatly detract from the experience. If you have not read previous novels by Grace, you will enjoy this book. It was too repetitive for me. I rate this 6 of 10.",3.0,0,2022
Telltale Heart of Dark Hound of the Baskervilles,"Do not read this book alone, especially in a wilderness cabin in a jungle. I was expecting a Hawaii-style mystery with flora, fauna, myth, and legend, but not the horror and intensity of this thriller. With the creepiness of Poe and Conrad and the suspense of Sherlock Holmes, its tale sucks in the reader as surely as the creatures who attack their prey on the fictional (Maui) island. Grady is a naive narrator, a likable, blue collar handyman who, like Marlow, leaves his Maine home behind to venture thousands of miles away to our 50th state. But it's pre-vaccine, COVID times, a restrictive environment which lends a ghostly pall of shuttered resorts and walking-dead homeless beach dwellers. His trans-Pacific move was made possible by the offer of a caretaker's job for an eccentric billionaire, Wes Minton, who lords it over his secluded fiefdom far from the madding tourists. Grady's easy-breezy duties are further lightened by Wes's lengthy absences to his even-more-remote compound near the ocean, virtually inaccessible due to lava fields en route, and treacherous coral reefs beneath the wild waves. Under the auspices of running an environmental sanctuary for endangered species, complete with an indoor aviary larger than most homes and dozens of aquariums, Wes is free to pursue his passions, untouched by the interference from law enforcement or wildlife protection agencies. Grady is befriended by Dalita, a sometimes employee of Wes, and her wife, Lorelei (symbolism?), a wedding photographer; but they are quick to tell Grady to mind his own business when his questions about previous caretakers, as well as numerous missing people on the island, are broached. Meanwhile, Grady develops an obsession about finding Jessica, a young woman who had shared the same trans-Pacific flight with him. Her girlfriend Raina initially thinks she wandered off after a night of bar-hopping, strictly forbidden under Covid protocols, and that she might be in police custody. Furthermore, Raina is what we would call an unreliable narrator: unkempt, drugged up, skinny as an addict, and foggy brained. But she has an innocence that is remindful of Rima, the jungle girl from Green Mansions, and her transformation when she cleans up her act is as undeniable as the metamorphoses of the wildlife of the island who have endured and thrived for tens of thousands of years. As an employee of The Aquarium (like Maui's at Ma'alea Harbor), her knowledge of all creatures great and small proves invaluable to Grady as he determines to find Jessica and learn more about his strange employer; most of all, if the two are linked, and perhaps to the other missing people. Meanwhile, his frequent slamming of sixpacks of PBR, or pibbah in Maine slang, often results in nightmarish hallucinations in which Hawaiian ghosts from traditional lore, such as the Kaupe or the Lost Dog of Hana (google them) appear before him. But they, too, seem to deliver mixed messages like everyone else: are they warning him? guiding him? planning to boot him from the island? kill him? These scenes are truly as terrifying as anything in The Exorcist, and unexpected in a book that had seemed to promise, ""My Summer Vacation, Hawaiian-style."" My own suspicions arose first at the 30% mark, but I changed my mind about the characters and plot several times, almost until the end. In this way, the story proves to be engaging and riveting. Although Grady isn't the brightest light in the chandelier, and the three young women seem sketchy, at best, I found myself cheering them on, hoping for a victorious conclusion to their  quest, and answers to the many layers of mystery. Without revealing the ending, I will simply say, as if I were teaching this book to my high school or college students, the greatest threat to our survival--planet, wilderness, humanity--is not an eccentric billionaire (Jeff Bezos and Larry Ellison, notwithstanding), or poisonous sea urchins or giant predatory birds, but instead, a global pandemic in which too many people refuse to get vaccinated, flaunt arrogant resistance to Covid protocols, and party on, never realizing how extinct they could become, like the dinosaurs. Only then will the islands truly revert to the spirits of the ancestors, who were right in their midst all along. Aloha and mahalo nui loa for reading my humble remarks.",4.0,1,2022

"Slow start, but it redeemed itself","I almost called it quits on this book. The action and suspense didn't really start until about 25% into the book. Until then, it was a lot of new-Mom anxious navel gazing. I appreciate that the author wanted to tackle postpartum mental issues, but it just wasn't very entertaining. But then, things got interesting, and introducing a second character's point of view added more variety. I ultimately enjoyed the character development and complexity of characters, as well as the suspenseful revelation of the truth.",4.0,1,2022
Excellent Reference!,"I have a pretty large collection of books detailing herbal remedies. This is one that I know I will return to again and again.<br /><br />The book is sorted into 3 parts:<br />Understanding Herbal Medicine: This is a beginner's guide to herbs and how they can be used.<br />Herbs for Healing: A succinct overview of 90 herbs and what to do with them. This is probably aimed more at someone starting out with herbs, but is also a good guide to these plants even for more experienced herbalists.<br />Remedies for Health and Wellness: To my mind this is where the real value of the book lies. It contains 300 recipes for a host of ailments. It's broken down into remedies for physical wellness, mental health and skin / beauty remedies. Consider it a dictionary of herbal combinations for a multitude of needs.<br /><br />Throughout the book emphasis is laid on how very simple it is for anyone to use these methods. Most of the items needed to create the remedies in the book are probably already in your kitchen. There's no need to spend large sums of money on buying specialist equipment.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly. For the last 25 years I've found myself using James Duke's Green Pharmacy as my go-to for herbal remedies, but now I believe I have a replacement. And a better one at that!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided with an advance copy by the publisher.",5.0,1,2022

Cute Christmas romance,"Cute, Hallmark-esque story. Loved the set up/meet-cute. It was a fun way for them to be introduced. Joseph was so grumpy and rude but who can blame him really. It was almost shocking to find out soon thereafter what a good guy he really is.<br />I will confess that I'm not generally a fan of billionaire books. Usually I wonder what the point is in making the person so rich. A lot I've read just needed enough money to hop on a plane or something. Being a billionaire was just too much. But this story is different. Being so rich set them up for the conflict of the book that wouldn't have happened unless the author had made him a movie star or something. So I had no problem with him being so rich in this one. It was a useful component of the plot.<br />The ending felt slightly abrupt to me since the HEA was implied but in no way assured. I think I'd have liked what was written as the epilogue to be another regular chapter in the book and then the epilogue could show them further down the road in their relationship. But that is just me. I like to see the HEA.<br />Clean, enjoyable Christmas story. The stuff Christmas movies are made of...<br /><br />No sex, language or violence",5.0,1,2022
disappointing,"I understand that Maverick has trust issues, that he has had to be cruel to survive. But when you read how he thinks she owes him sex bc he protected her, how he is disgusted by her if she won’t sleep with him, how he thinks she deserves scraps from him because she is worthless unless he can sleep with her… then he treats her with disgust and actually is willing to let her die and be raped by the bad guys and tortured simply because she showed human compassion… he’s pretty disgusting and a huge turn off. The main character, Arwen, started out as fiery and strong. Then she married him and became stupid and spineless. Apologizing, giving him sex just because she’s lonely, begging him to keep her then thanking him for not allowing her to be raped and murdered even though he wants to. It’s pathetic and I lost all respect for both characters. How the heck did this book get so many stars? I’ll never understand.",1.0,0,2022
2 Big Plot Holes,"Once I run into a big plot hole I find it difficult to keep following any book or series.  In this book, within the first few chapters…2 glaring plot holes hit me.  Spoilers, I suppose.  The first is, a young woman wants to leave the security of her town because she’s bored, etc.  She can’t survive without the medicine the town’s labs and technicians provide.  Knowing this, she gathers all the ingredients for the medicine and thinks she’s going to what…produce it in the wild without labs and equipment…produce it before leaving and “hope” it lasts a lifetime…and doesn’t spoil???  It makes no sense.  The second is a young man is marooned in the desert with an older man.  The older man is a scientist that has been working on “the cure” for decades.  They are the only 2 humans left…so they think.  To make a long story short, the young man “releases the only 2 living experiments” after decades of work because he suddenly has a moral experience and now has to chase down the two subhumans because they are the “key” to humanity.  The doc was literally in the next room…you couldn’t wake him up and ask him what’s going on???…you just release the latest, greatest experiments into the wild.  With both of these plot holes I just can’t take this book seriously.  Good idea at first.  It had some potential but the author didn’t bother to think about common sense.",2.0,0,2022
Too Many Long Quotes,"First, I must confess that I bought and read this book because I thought it was written by Erik Larson, an author I love.  That led to much confusion on my part as this book lapses between third person recounting of history and first person narrative of personal experiences.  That really confused me because the first person narrative was of a merchant mariner with decades of experience sailing in the late 20th century.  Erik Larson (the author I thought I was reading) was never a merchant mariner.  But that is my fault, not Eric Larsson's (the actual author of this book).<br /><br />Having finally corrected my misimpression, I have to say this is a poorly written book.  A very large percentage of the text is just long, unedited quotes of 19th century newspaper articles, letters and poems.  Nor did I find the switching back and forth between narrations of the 19th century shipwreck and 20th century experiences of the author useful in telling the story.<br /><br />I will have to say that the wreck of the Atlantic in 1846, which is the central point of the book, was an interesting story to learn.  And the author's writing style, when he was actually narrating (as opposed to filling pages with unedited newspaper articles and poems) is a good style.  Thus my two stars.  On whole, though, I do not recommend this book.",2.0,0,2022
Truth is Stranger Than Fiction,"This is the true life story of Bob Lazar, an MIT-educated PhD scientist and contractor who worked at Area 51 and S4.  In his very first few days of on-site work in the highly secretive Area 51, Bob sees the 9 alien spacecrafts the US has in hangars and is made aware of the little aliens that the US has been communicating with.  He gets to go INTO one of the craft and study its strange propulsion system and perform experiments on it.  Pretty mind-blowing revelations right at the get-go.<br /><br />But it is an honest autobiography, and many of Bob’s faults and failings come through.  If I were to critique him, he is a nerdy science brain, and lacking in good human interaction skills.  He was very young and naive, and unfortunately, that dictated how he responded to these unusual experiences.  After swearing to top secrecy and awaiting government top security clearances, he runs and tells all his friends all the details and says, hey come out to the desert and I’ll show you all the top secret test flights, because, uh, that’ll keep me safe, right?  It leads him into very, very deep paranoia which consumes him and screws up not just his career, reputation and personal life, but also screwed up the public’s ability to getting any more details about this incredible, life-shattering information.<br /><br />I feel if he had been less naive, he could have stayed there longer, learned so much more, and then later disclosed it in a less harmful way without all the paranoid drama that really destroyed him.  It is a little sad about what has happened to this guy’s life as a result, and missed opportunity.<br /><br />As far as new alien info is concerned, it is all revealed in the first two chapters, nothing new after that.  A good, interesting story, with moments of humor but not a whole lot of new alien info.  Has many typos, but they are minor.  A decent read.",4.0,1,2022

There are no words...,"...at least from me, that can adequately describe the humor and poignancy in this short story.  Ms. Atwood's writing stunned me on page one, and every one thereafter.  There were fascinating analogies and descriptions, as Ms. Atwood is an expert in creating thrilling strings of words.  She takes a ""What if?"" exercise to amazing heights of imagination.  Plus, being a story about conflict and gratitude, Ms. Atwood gives us tear inducing feelings of the narrator, whose name we never learn.  Couched in fantasy, this is a story about Everywoman and her relationship with her mother, or the relationship she may have needed.  This story is simply another reason why Ms. Atwood should have a Nobel prize for literature, an acknowledgement of a consistent life-long body of work.  When???",5.0,1,2022
Not very magical.,"I struggled to get through this book, TBH. I try to force myself to finish all books I've paid for so I pushed through 'til the end. It was definitely not an addicting read. It almost felt like work to get through it towards the middle. The author obviously put a lot of work into his writing style to make the story sound old-fashioned. This means long-winded sentences and unusual words that no one uses (literally had to use google dictionary on about 20 ridiculous words that I've never heard before.) So I was torn between appreciating the writing style for thrusting you back to the 1840s/Medieval Fae realm...and feeling bogged down by overly flowery language.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-I liked the MCs (didn't love them) but there were definitely some lovely and sexy moments I enjoyed.<br />-The fae realm and the fae folk were wonderful.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-flowery language<br />-the secondary storyline set in London. I could have cared less.<br />-too long, probably because of the huge amount of subplot going on in London with the supporting cast of characters.<br />-the MCs fall in love super fast and then Shrike just constantly drops everything to help Wren with his mortal realm problems.

As member of the LGBTQ community,  as a former addict and as a poverty stricken individual this book was written just as much for me as it was anyone else.

A Flawed Treatment Of Ecclesiastes,"This treatise on Ecclesiastes contains hits and misses, and if you are truly short on time the bottom line is that I cannot recommend it. However, I hope that the few minutes it will take you to peruse this review will point you in the right direction before choosing a book you will spend your upcoming days or even weeks reading. (Skip straight to the last paragraph if your clock is really ticking.)<br /><br />The writer, Douglas Wilson, does get out of the starting blocks well by ascribing Solomon as the author, with which I am in full agreement. Solomonic authorship is also the simplest and most straightforward, adhering to an “Ockham’s razor” approach to exegesis that the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one. Wilson also successfully latches on to the one point I believe is absolutely key to understanding this entire book: “. . . the phrase under the sun . . . occurs numerous times and is extremely significant. ‘Under the sun’ is the realm where vanity reigns and should be understood as this world...” So far, so good.<br /><br />From there, the author proceeds onto shaky ground with occasionally solid, but at other times very questionable, exegesis of this admittedly most difficult book of the Bible. Probably the biggest misinterpretation, which permeates the entire rest of this work, is his position that “. . . God alone gives the power to enjoy vanity.” Not enjoying or enduring life DESPITE the vanity of it, but actually ENJOYING VANITY ITSELF. Firstly, the word translated “vanity” is “hebel,” which literally means vapor or smoke. That makes Wilson’s interpretation somewhat nonsensical, but even if you accept “vanity” or “meaningless” as the best translation it simply does not make sense to actually enjoy it. Part of the issue may lie with the author’s unfortunate use of the Authorized Version, rather than a more literal or word-for-word translation like the NASB. This is the first time I’ve seen this “enjoy the vanity” approach taken with Ecclesiastes, and by the end of the book I was still completely baffled in trying to understand it.<br /><br />The author also treats Solomon unfairly as he introduces the book. Describing Solomon’s acknowledged foray into folly, he states “He then turned and experimented with everything he could eat, drink, smoke, or sleep with . . .” which is simply unbiblical and unsupported by any external evidence. In particular smoking infers drug experimentation of which there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever, and “everything he could . . . sleep with” implies far more than even Solomon’s infamous seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines suggests. Especially considering that Solomon embarked on his experimental journey with “my mind still guiding me with wisdom,” what I think may be an attempt at hyperbole falls flat and is at best simply untrue.<br /><br />Ecclesiastes 3 (“A time to be born and a time to die . . .”) often presents a challenge to expositors of this book. But here Wilson tries to ascribe ALL these contrasting statements to God. Shoehorning God into this framework simply does not work, and the exegetical contortions required for the attempt become rather ridiculous. A couple of examples:<br />“Sometimes we cast stones, and other times we gather them. God gives the time of demolition; He gives the time of construction.”<br />And: “Prosperity is His gift, and so are stock-market crashes . . .”<br />Stock market crashes are a gift of God??<br /><br />And in this same chapter arises another hermeneutical “device” I have seen at least one other author apply to Ecclesiastes. He states what he thinks the passage means, and then quotes from another book of the Bible that says the same thing — but that doesn’t AT ALL support that is what the specific passage IN ECCLESIASTES means. For ""A time to be silent and a time to speak"":<br />“God enables a man to say nothing, keeping his silence. God gives him words to speak (v. 7). ‘The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord’ (Prov. 16:1).”<br />I agree with Proverbs, but simply quoting it does not make those words the correct interpretation for an unrelated verse in Ecclesiastes. (The author who uses this approach profusely is Jeffrey Meyers in “Ecclesiastes Through New Eyes: A Table in the Mist.” I do recommend that book — with some caveats — but definitely NOT as a first read into Ecclesiastes.)<br /><br />In Ecclesiastes 4 the author makes a flat-out reading error that raised warning bells and caused me to scrutinize the rest of the book with a much more cynical eye than even before: “Men who are already dead are better off than the men still alive, or the men not yet born.” Even the Authorized Version is clear here:<br />“Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.”<br />Clearly (in multiple translations that I double-checked) Ecclesiastes states that the unborn are better off than the dead, which the author reverses. A plain-reading mistake like this one certainly casts doubts on ALL the interpretive work of the author, especially where complex exegesis is required, although I will say that while I disagreed with the author in many places I did not find any other outright errors like this one.<br /><br />One final note as I conclude my review is that the author provides a full book summary at the end of every chapter. This was somewhat helpful in keeping the “big picture” of the entire book (both Ecclesiastes and the author’s) in view, but it was rephrased slightly differently every time which became confusing and sometimes felt contradictory. In particular the author kept labeling the last entire quarter of Ecclesiastes as:<br />“Fourth division (8:16–12:14): The last section of the book is a miscellany, removing various obstacles and addressing practical concerns.”<br />Or: “The last section clears up remaining problems.”<br />This felt like the author didn’t have a good grasp of Ecclesiastes, or didn’t spend enough time thinking about how to clearly organize their book.<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot recommend this book. For the layperson or church teacher I continue to point to Executable Outlines for a solid and very straightforward introduction to Ecclesiastes. For pastors and those with some formal Bible education, I also recommend the “Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs NIV Application Commentary” by Iain Provan — though I will warn you that while the Ecclesiastes treatment is quite sound I found his interpretation of Song of Songs (the second half of the book) to be quite unbiblical. In that review I also provide some classroom teaching suggestions for Ecclesiastes.",2.0,0,2022

Knight from the Ashes - Not bothering with rest of series; terrible book,"Right away this book was just plain silly. When the motivating reason for marrying a particular person is to outrank another person, it tells you how immature and petty the person is.  There were so many totally inane conversations, thoughts, actions, I was rolling my eyes. (as these characters did over and over when they weren't smirking or snorting or talking in their sleep). In one scene a female character heads north on a forest trail for days to deliver a note in a low cut, jeweled riding outfit, alone, and at one point she thinks, ""I should have brought a map."" The writing made no sense: ""she clings to the weapon like a squirrel."" ""like a stubborn squirrel."" (they get to eat squirrels too!) They meet people along the trail and  she immediately says, ""I think we can take them."" No thoughts, just blindly make assumptions and fight first and think about it later. Clover was headstrong, stubborn, and unlikeable. The end of this book was terrible and a cliffhanger. I read the summary of the next book (2) and thought, ""NO WAY!"" If author's husband brought most of this to the story to the table, I'm done reading them. I may be done with Shari as well after the end of the Riven Kingdoms, a series which started well and fell apart. I don't read just to read. I enjoy the ride, the journey, the story.

Wow! Three books in one! A must have!,"I have read each one of these books separately but when I saw the box set on sale I had to snap it up. I loved how Ms Knorr brings this story to life.

This fae, Laec, shows up in her most recent book A Blossom at Midnight which is another must read. I cannot recommend this box set highly enough. You will never go wrong with any book from this author.",5.0,1,2022
Mixed Emotions,"I have mixed emotions about this book.  It was an interesting story, a good attempt but not my cup of tea.  I liked the last 3 chapters the best.  I wish the story has explained more about the spying aspect.  I loved Colin and his family.  I didn’t think too much of Maddie even taking her “history” in to account.  Did not like the back and forth, back and forth in time; 2019 back to 1940, back to 2019.  Two story lines to follow with an already rather confusing story.  At 70% I gave up and read the remaining chapters in chronological order – 1940 to 1941 and then to 2019.  I couldn’t take the whiplash anymore.  The story was way too convoluted and unbelievable.  Maddie and Precious were distant relatives and Arabella just happens to be related to her.  Really?  The book was way too long.  I wanted to get it over with.  The book didn’t really have that much history about WWII in London, just a little about the Blitz.  It was mostly Alex taking Eva out to dinner to fancy clubs and restaurants.  The book didn’t really have that much about fashion; not that much description of the clothes.  Yes, they were both models but where was the fashion?<br />SPOILER ALERT:  I don’t think any reputable surgeon would perform a double mastectomy on an 18 year old young woman.  That part of the story was too far-fetched and inaccurate.  And, genetic testing for breast cancer genes is NOT to be confused with DNA testing for genealogy.  Two totally different things.  So, bottom line, kind of 50/50.  Didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, don’t regret reading it.  I’m glad others enjoyed it.",3.0,0,2022

Heartfelt,"I couldn't stop reading because I just had to know what was coming next. I also felt a kinship because I had several German Shepherds as well as Pit Bulls, Rottweiler and Doberman.

Perfect for animal lovers,"Say Goodbye for Now was the first Catherine Ryan Hyde novels I read, and I’ve since read nearly ten others. This story made a great impression on me, and I was taken in by her simple yet meaningful writing style. I’ve since learned that this style isn’t limited to this one novel, and that in every book, the characters vacillate between being unable to stop talking and speaking in short, choppy words, like “Oh. Right. Well.” In all her novels, children and vulnerable adults suffer from deep insecurities and act surprised and unsure when they come across real kindness. They often worry that their incessant talking will cause the listener to fly into a rage, or that if they ask for too much or wear out their welcome, they’ll get yelled at or beaten. It’s very sad, and you do come across such characters in real life who have been severely abused. If these types of characters and dialogue really speak to you, you’ll love her books.<br /><br />There are two plotlines in this story: one involves a boy’s loyalty to a wounded dog, and the other is an interracial relationship in the Deep South during the late 1950s. I was far more interested in the dog, which takes precedence in the first half of the film. I loved the opening chapters, and I was immediately sucked in by how the boy came across the wounded dog on the outskirts of the freeway, and how he coaxed him to trust that he was going to help him. He dragged the dog in a wagon for miles until he found a veterinarian who would treat the case, and the relationship between the boy and the stray was very touching. The veterinarian, a no-nonsense, independent woman came across as cold at times, but she just had more experience with animals than people.<br /><br />One of my favorite Hyde books, I’d recommend it if you have a soft spot for animals, or if you can imagine helping a wounded dog. I was the perfect reader for this book, since I’ve been known to carry around a plastic bag of cat food when I go walking in case I run into a homeless stray.",4.0,1,2022
Fun read but avoid copper sick,"10mg copper/day felt good for a couple weeks. Then the benefits faded away and then liver started feeling sore with 5mg dose. I stopped copper supplement but there is 1mg in my multivitamin, and even that caused a little sickness. The author doesn't talk much about balancing the copper intake with zinc or other minerals, only how minerals displaced copper and cause deficiency.<br />If my liver is protesting 10mg/day I'm certainly not going to rub 50mg into my skin. But the author is smart and witty and the topic is covered well. My hair mineral test was a little low in copper, I bet it's not anymore!",5.0,1,2022

It was just too much for me and Selena is a favorite of mine, I’ve read all her books. I also didn’t enjoy the twins turning on each other.

Heaps full of MEH 1.5  ⭐,"This book started out interesting, but  sadly did not stay that way.<br />The plot was simple enough, but seemed bland as it went on.<br />I had a hard time believing this lady was a wolf biologist because there was never really an surety backed by science in her motives or thoughts. Her whole ""job"" was to be a ""nanny"" to ""wild"" wolf pups in a house. It never struck her as odd that they weren't in some nature preserve, or that everyone spoke about trauma and PTSD as if they were human.<br />-we're supposed to believe that wolves have a fantastic smell but Holden only smelled more than human to the PUPS?!<br />-we FINALLY get some adult time at 87%, they kiss, remove shirts, turn the page.. She's  exhausted after that good loving. WHAT?!<br />-the dialog was TERRIBLE, like a game of telephone.  Character thinks something,  tells 2nd character (verbatim), 2nd character tells 3rd character VERBATIM!!<br />-what's the difference between lycanthropy and werewolves.. we know WHY they're different (parentage) but HOW?!

feelings are complicated,I don’t think I’ve ever read a book with so many complicated feelings and relationships. This is one of those dark romances that leave you wanting. Wanting something more definitive. Wanting more passion. Stories about angels and demons always tend to feel a little heavy in the side of morality and this one is as well. I can never decide if I enjoy it or if it makes me think to much. I love how Lucifer is the funniest character it always cracks me up when writes do that. The pace was a little murky.<br />And I’m not really feeling Neriah and Mark. I don’t know I enjoyed this but it’s one of those ones where I need more. That’s what it is.

Needs an editor,Interesting ideas but rambling. The author does not do a good job developing his arguments. He jumps time periods a lot. I’m not a historian but I asked one that I know to read the first two chapters of this book because they were contrary to so many ideas that I had read before. For example I believe that Rome got it’s grain primarily from Egypt and North Africa. On enormous grain barges -corbita. But this author states that the grain came from what is now known as Ukraine via Greek ships. No mention of Egypt. The historian I consulted agrees that Egypt was most important. So it does make me question the information in this book.<br />I was most interested in the information about the special quality of the soil in Ukraine and how that allowed for abundant crops. I worry how the poor survive if a quarter of the worlds grain production remains stuck in Ukraine because of the war.<br />I am going to continue reading about grain but recommend to others read elsewhere.,2.0,0,2022
"Another great thriller; well done, Ms. Rose!!","Stirring up memories of her sister being abducted 35 years ago and only recently showing up alive, Eva Rae is assigned to a 14-year-old-case of Clarissa Smalls, who was kidnapped from a maternity ward and mysteriously shows up in a swamp, pregnant, and unwilling to talk with anyone about her ordeal.  Eva Rae feels that she is the only one who can get through to the girl and help solve the case.  At the same time, another newborn girl is kidnapped from the same maternity ward.  This baby needs heart surgery, so the pressure is on to find her quickly.  Eva Rae, as always, is passionately involved in the cases, and keeps digging, to the point that she becomes a target as the perp tries to foil the search.  Ms. Rose is a master at creating twists and turns, red herrings and surprises into a thrilling story that keeps me on the set of my chair, losing sleep, not wanting to put the book down until the case is solved. This is a great series, with strong characters and multiple story lines woven together skillfully to keep the reader’s interest.

The German Wife seems too real to be fiction!,"Oh! What can I say? There's more than enough blame to go around! There's only one innocent in this story. Must when I could glimpse the good in someone, they'd turn full circle & I'd hate 'em again! The German Wife herself is not blameless, but those were hard days.  I can see how she wasn't aware of the atrocities! The German people were being lied to by their own government, but could they believe the Allies? I'm sure they thought not!  I've been to Dachau's Memorial & Museum. It is chilling to be there. I couldn't help but remember that it was the ""good"" camp, Hitler's Showcase. It was where the Red Cross & other humanitarian groups were taken to show how good the prisoners were being treated! HOW did they manage that? How did they hide the stick people they had worked & starved to the brink of death? That's something I will never understand. That said, this book is as close to a ""true story"" as it gets, without being actually true! I don't want to be a spoiler, so just read it yourself! It's worth the time.

Great story BUT....,"The story itself is great. Full of adventure and it moves along at a nice pace with good balance between adventure and quiet moments, HOWEVER....this book could have been published as two or even three books and it desperately needs an editor/proofreeding.  I was able to follow the story line but there were  soooo many instances of a cogmitive break because of either formatting, punctuation and choices of words.  It seemed to me that this was written in another language originally and then translated with Google translate and a thesaurus and using the most obscure words when every day language would have been a better choice for fluidity. I cannot count the number of times I would just stop and have to sort out what was possibly intended because of a word choice or a typing error that made understanding a scene much more difficult than it needed to be.<br /><br />That being said the story is worth the read. I sincerely hope Elena finds a writing partner or editor/proofreader who can help with making it more native english speaker friendly.",4.0,1,2022

A widower and his childen are overrun with a menagerie and houseguests when Miss Truelove sends unwanted presents.

Even the ones you thoroughly disliked in the beginning.<br /><br />It made me want to wander off and live in a cabin in the woods, sorrounded by the natural beauty of the wild. The authors descriptions of the graphic scenery and the settings the books take place in, is amazing, and very much comes to life on the pages.<br /><br />The way she approaches death, breast cancer,drug addiction, and depression, is loaded with the compassion and understanding we need more of in this world.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a ""feel good read, with a happily ever after ending.""",4.0,1,2022
some good secondary characters and promising ideas,"Rating: 2.75<br /><br />“I considered the Arcana, wondering if it had some healing properties. Decided to not try or suggest such a thing. I didn’t know what was inside me, what it could do. Just because it whispered things at me, we weren’t joined at the hip.”<br /><br />— Night Tricks (Midnight Magic Book 1) by Richard Amos<br /><br />If reading that made your brain hurt, you’re not alone.  That’s Clayton or Clay as he prefers to be called, warlock and the POV of the novel and series.<br /><br />This novel has some promising elements to its plot, and overall series arc.  It has some interesting secondary characters like the button-eyed demon. But to get to those and others, the reader must have an either a love for certain clichés story elements, a character that’s so unbelievably dimwitted, that he repeatedly does the wrong thing , leaps into sex, hides who he is but doesn’t really know who he is, does amazing things NO One can do but has basically a meh , that’s sorta neat, attitude.<br /><br />Anyway see below:<br /><br />Cliché:<br />🔹Rift in universe caused by magical war. Literally called The Rift.  Soo many books with exact element down to that name.  Please find another name, someone.<br /><br />🔹Billionaire Vampire with black rose tattoos, because dark beauty with thorns. Yep.  Complete with alabaster glowy body.<br /><br />MC is hard to read as the book is from his POV and he often comes across as someone with the emotional maturity of a tweenage valley girl.  There’s a lot of EEKs everywhere! In that exact manner.<br /><br />As in “I mean…EEK!”<br /><br />At the end of the first quarter of the book,  I was seriously thinking of not finishing.<br /><br />Tae Frost and Clayton Christmas’s relationship  is along the lines of I want you, let’s have sex.  Oh, no, it’s you, not me.  Let’s have sex.  More woe is me.  More, sex. Oh , no. Look what we did.  More woe.  Rinse , repeat.  Add lies, weepy history, lies.<br /><br />You get ready at one point to say to any villain “have at them”.<br /><br />By the end, the author has telegraphed who or where the villain of the plot  is.  And they are on the run with the hero still lying his brains out.<br /><br />If I continue on, it will be only to flip through the pages to the end to see if I’m right.<br /><br />No more EEK for me.<br /><br />For fans of this author, I’m sure you’ll already have found this book and series.<br /><br />For other lovers of magic and Urban Fantasy Romance fiction, I’ll leave it up to you.",3.0,0,2022

Interesting,"I found the start of the book to be a bit long. I wondered who the book would actually be about. It was an ok book. What I found disturbing was when the author had a character speaking about how God clothed Adam and Eve with the skin of a spotless, unblemished lamb. We all know this was the 1st sacrifice but no where in the Bible does it say what kind of animal it was. The character went on further to explain from then on sacrifices were to be made, and the reason Cain's sacrifice was not accepted by God was because he didn't sacrifice a spotless lamb, I believe the words went something along the lines of he couldn't bother to ask his brother for a lamb. But that was also the attitude of the character. The Bible doesn't say it needed to be a lamb and it was the way and attitude of Cain that displeased the Lord. Unless I'm reading the Bible totally wrong and the commentaries I read were wrong as well. I love reading Biblical fiction, and good Biblical fiction should lead you to read the Bible, however, writing incorrect information from the Bible isn't ok, if someone new to the faith read this, what if they took it for fact and didn't double check the Bible? People more familiar with the Bible know that people in Genesis did offer sacrifices but it was not God's law until Exodus!  I hope Rachel Duncan reads this and in future books will proceed with more caution, especially if people newer to the faith read this and takes it as what the Bible means, it would not be good, it could also lead to people turning to the Bible, its a thin line but I'd rather see truth printed in Biblical fiction.",3.0,0,2022

I loved this series,"I really loved this series. Author does a great job. Lots of twists and turns, surprise conclusions, character development etc to keep me interested. I finished the entire series in 12 days, some of the books were longer than others.<br />Like a lot of authors lately that I've read you can tell they have to get their causes thrown into their stories to try and educate people and that part drives me nuts, Especially when it's repeated in each book in the series. It gets old fast. Also a lot of food descriptions which took up a lot of fill type writing and easily could have been left out. They really didn't add to the storyline at all.<br />There was a whole lot of descriptive reactions that were constant throughout the books and easily could have been left out. It got old fast. A LOT of typos that should have been caught in editing.<br />Trying to ""write"" accents into a book is difficult and never really done well at all. They really shouldn't be used because it seriously slowed down the reading just trying to interpret what the character was supposed to be saying.<br />I loved the flame pet but the snark though funny was too overdone and much of it could have easily been left out.<br />The most annoying thing though was the overdone shifter prejudice. That unfortunately is carrying over to an even far greater degree in the next series Pet Psychic. It's obvious a huge cause in real life for the author. Books and shows for entertainment really shouldn't be used as an educational thing for causes because it doesn't have the wanted effect for the writer. It tends to annoy and turn people off to their cause even for those that already feel the same way. People read and watch shows for entertainment not for education.<br />However having said all of that I still loved the storylines and mysteries. I couldn't wait to get to the end not because I was over it but to see what happens. I look forward to reading the next series of her books which is Pet psychic mysteries.",5.0,1,2022
cute story with a few issues,"Rating: 3.25🌈<br /><br />Where There’s a Witch There’s a Way  dives right into a instant mate situation, albeit between two people who’ve known each other for a while.<br /><br />One is Titus Compton, of the town’s Witches Council. The other is one of the many werewolf Stone brothers,  Kean Stone, brother to the Alpha/Mayor Adhan.<br /><br />There’s little background, Broom assumes you’ve read the first book in the series, The Crazy Bookshop, where everyone and everything was established.<br /><br />You really do require that history there because all the drama and mystery coming into play here stems from the events there.  You’re going to be pretty much lost without it.<br /><br />All the characters, the warm-hearted relationships are back! The mystery, the villain and yes, the sex are all on the soft, PG-13 side.  The group works together to learn magic, become a found family, and confront what looks to be a deepening series arc piece of villainy.<br /><br />It’s fun, mostly light hearted, and not really scary.<br /><br />I did have several issues here.  At the end , when the group goes off to discover what and where all the dark magic is coming from, they split up.  The reader gets one group’s side of the action.  The other more fabulous tale? With waaay more interesting things that occurred?  It’s as told to.<br /><br />I was absolutely dumbfounded.  If I’d had the author there, this is how it would have gone.<br /><br />Me:  so there’s was zombies, an apocalypse, flames, ghouls, everything underground.  Magical fighting galore?<br /><br />Author: yup<br /><br />Me: you gave us two , maybe 3 sentences.<br /><br />Author:  yup<br /><br />Me: *blink blink*<br /><br />Walks to door, door closes.<br /><br />Author:  you’re coming back, right?<br /><br />Hmmmm.<br /><br />So utterly disappointing.  Really?<br /><br />It also introduces a couple of new characters but we get nothing?<br /><br />So either that going to be a whole new book to describe those happenings or we in the dark but either way, it’s a majorly flawed component here.<br /><br />And it reduces the impact of that whole event.  As does the way the author leaves many of the new and secondary characters.<br /><br />So for me, Where There’s a Witch There’s a Way keeps adding new characters and new bits to the overall arc but I’m not sure it’s made the series any better.  It’s lost some of the original charm, some of the whimsy and goofiness that I enjoyed so.<br /><br />I’m sure I’ll be continuing on if only to see if it can recapture some of the joy that brought me into it.<br /><br />If you’re a fan of this author, or of light fantasy, I’ll leave that decision up to you as well.<br /><br />Cadenbury Town series:<br />🔹The Crazy Bookshop 1<br />🔹Where There’s a Witch There’s a Way 2",3.0,0,2022
"Three Not So Little Words…. Ridiculous, Grueling, Exasperating","Well, you probably have already figured out that I did not enjoy this story. I am an avid reader of every romance genre out there. Fortunately, I have discovered many gifted authors that produced quality, entertaining reads that offer a much needed escape from the real world. This book transported me into a world that I continuously wanted to be rescued from!!! God knows I tried. I so wanted to bail when I got a third of the way through but I persevered hoping against hope that Ms. Quinn would redeem herself. But alas….. that never happened, and these are some of the reasons why:<br />• After discovering that she’s pregnant, Penny’s brother Pasey insists that the father, Eli Hornsby,<br />his best friend, must live platonically with Penny in her one bedroom apartment to take care of her every needs. See a problem there?<br />• Yes, she’s going through some changes as a result of the pregnancy but how many times can you attribute your obnoxious behavior on being “hormonal.” Answer: Too many to count<br />• Nausea happens, but deal with it in a mature manner. Not possible for Penny.<br />• The visits to the Obstetrician were quite disturbing. Totally unprofessional and out of line. No humor there. Her sex drive in the second and third trimester was over the top and frankly quite annoying.<br />• Eli so needed a reality check. How he had feelings for Penny is beyond reason. Their relationship development made my head spin… and not in a good way!<br />• This book is WAY too long.<br /><br />This is my second read by this author. I read “See Me After Class” and did not enjoy the storyline but I thought, after so many 4 and 5 star reviews, I may have just picked up a less than stellar story. Regrettably, this book was worse than the other. I paired this book with the Audible Companion and even listening to the story with dual narration didn’t help. I ended up feeling like they were owed an apology for being  given such a weak script.<br /><br />Just for the record, I’m not usually a disgruntled reader. Thankfully, I’ve had many good and great reading experiences, enough to know good  storytelling when I see it. Every reader has their own preferences, but I really don’t understand the positive reviews. To each his own, I guess.",1.0,0,2022

Fairly Enjoyable Read,"I have read a fair amount of alien romance and I always enjoy the stories…as long as the aliens are humanoid. If they look like lizards then I’m really not into it. Anyways, thankfully the aliens in this book look very human.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story, I didn’t hate it, but I didn’t love it either. The MMC’s cruelty in the beginning and his constant insistence that FMC was a spy really put me off the book. In this alien culture females are revered and treated with care. FMC was promised, over and over again, that she would be treated well when they forced her to choose a husband. It’s against the law to hurt females in any way. Yet they relinquished her to MMC’s control without giving her any recourse if she was being hurt or abused. I didn’t like it.<br /><br />I wanted a sweet alien romance. The main characters in this story didn’t actually get together until like 75% into the book. Before that point Theo was really mean to her. I don’t care if she eventually liked his brutish ways. I don’t care. I didn’t want to read a bully romance.<br /><br />Adding to that, Theo never treated FMC like his cherished mate. He treated her like his possession. He was angry when another male tried to come close to her…so what does he do? Grabs her and hurts her while forcibly dragging her away, while simultaneously telling her he’s going to lock her up forever. That was at almost the end of the story. So romantic ☹️<br /><br />- M/F fantasy “romance”<br />- alien/human relationship<br />- fated mates<br />- triggers: bullying, kidnapping, attempted SA<br />- pregnancy",3.0,0,2022
Would not recommend to ANYONE,I read one of Colleen Hoover's other books and really liked it. So I downloaded this one. It was really one of the most unpleasantly disturbing books I have ever read AND I agree with some of the other reviews. The plot was ludicrous. The only reason I finished reading it was the fact that I was stuck without power after the hurricane and it was the only book I had downloaded on my iPad.,1.0,0,2022

Great concept but…,"I loved the story. I loved the idea behind it. It was a fresh concept that I thoroughly enjoyed. I actually enjoyed Viv as she developed through out the book. What did I hate? The absolute lack of editing. I almost couldn’t read the book. The grammatical errors were rough and got worse as the book went on. If the book had been better edited, I would have given it five stars, more if such a thing existed. It’s a shame that it’s so poorly edited.",4.0,1,2022
Well written,"This is the first book I have read from this author. I gave 4 stars because this is a seasoned writer and she's got a lot of other books in the series, and that alone deserves 4-stars because writing a series is hard work. This style of mystery isn't my cup of teas, but there's nothing negative to say about the book. The things I point out, are things I personally don't like, but you may, and should read the book. The premise of the book is good; however, it never really took off. The story held my interest for the most part, but the characters in my opinion fall flat. The dialog was mundane. No harsh language, but I prefer when characters use choice words when need be. I personally didn't feel connected to the characters in this book or any book when each chapter is in first person point of view. Flipping point of views, took me out of the story. There was a lot of telling of the story, instead of showing, and it was simple and not difficult to figure out what was going on. I wish all the chapters were as gripping as the first chapter. Overall, it was an easy read and if you are more of a Cozy mystery reader, this might be for you. I like more suspenseful mysteries and grittier,",4.0,1,2022
"Almost 5*s, but not quite!","So, I'm torn with this book. I really wanted to give this story 5*s, but the FMC just irked me. She has moments where she lets her walls down and enjoys Nic's company, but then her walls reappear and she chooses to pull away again. The girl is like a yo-yo. An emotional roller coaster ride that no one wants to ride. Nic is a saint for putting up with her, though he too has some issuses of his own. Nic is a man who doesn't 'do' love, or humans for that matter. However, he needs Leia to secure his future as ruler. Now, he just has to convince her to give hersle fto him, but he also9 fights against his true desires, refusing to believe or trust that his feelings for her go beyond her power to help with his ascension. There were a few times when I thought, ""Yes, Finally!"", but... nope... shut down again. These two infuriate me.<br />The story itself is good. The plot and characters, for the most part, are interesting and intriguing, but there was just something lacking. I'm still gonna read book 2, mostly so I can see if Nic's gets her back, but I also hope book two is a bit better. I hope Leia will finally see Nic's actions for what they are, even if he isn't sure of them himself. These two just need to be locked in a room together until they both come to terms with the truth that is right in front of them.<br />I guess we will have to wait and see.",4.0,1,2022

When they are delayed because of the damaged bridges, Elizabeth takes a walk through the woods, leading her to an act of heroism and eventually, a forced marriage due to time spent alone with Darcy.<br /><br />One does evil enough when one does nothing good. ~ German proverb<br /><br />Darcy has obligations and cannot remain with his new wife.

I love Randy Rainbow,"From a sometimes sad childhood to his triumph as an artist and a mensch, Randy gives us the inside scoop to his unexpected life.  With his usual humor but with incredible insight, he takes us on his unlikely journey.  It's a peek behind the curtain of a man who has found himself.  In lifting our spirits during these hard pandemic times he has gifted us with his enormous strength, his incredulity at his own success, and his passion to be a Broadway star.<br /><br />We have tickets to see his stage show (which sadly has been postponed twice) but this has made me want to see him all the more.

Just a bunch of arguing.,The synopsis made this book look like it was going to be very interesting. But it was not. It was just<br />a bunch of arguing between Nash and Knox as well as Naomi and Knox. It got boring really quick and was obvious it was going nowhere. All they do is fight. This book could have been really good but it fell short. There was no chemistry between the characters like there could have been. You know when you are rooting for them to get together for the whole book. They're just wasn't that I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the characters except for Waylay.

This Grandmother is Definitely Up To No Good,"In this charming novel by Sara Goodman Confino there is no doubt that the titular character is an octogenarian grandmother named Evelyn. The action changes time from the present, in which Evelyn is determined to help Jenna, her depressed adult granddaughter, get over a marital breakup, and the 1950s, when Evelyn was a Jewish teenager who defied her family to date a Portuguese man named Tony. In both timeframes, the defiant and norm defying Evelyn can be described as being ""up to no good."" In the present day, she has no driver's license and is not supposed to drive, but she does, She is not supposed to smoke or drink for health reasons, but she indulges whenever she pleases. Despite her rule-breaking behavior, she has a heart of gold and coaxes her granddaughter to accompany her on a trip to the New England coast, where the extended family went for vacations for decades. Of course, Evelyn has a hidden agenda, which is to introduce Evelyn to a man named Joe. On the long trip, Evelyn tells a surprised Jenna about her scandalous fling with Tony, who was not Jewish.  Though they had hoped to get married, her father forbids her to see him.  Much of the novel is devoted to the ill-fated romance and its long-lasting effects on the families.  Jenna is horrified to discover that her grandmother has arranged for Joe to show her around town. To add to her surprise, it turns out that Joe is the great nephew of Evelyn's first great love Tony.  Both ladies have quite a week, with Evelyn constantly revealing more bombshells from the past.  There is no guarantee what will happen, so I wouldn't want to spoil each reader's joy of following both women through the end of their consequential vacation. This book is a fun frolic full of humor and love.",5.0,1,2022
"This novel progresses like an autobiography,","and since the writer is, to our good fortune, still living, the story has a great deal of trouble finding an ending. It lacks the grace, polish, and form of good fiction. And yes, there are direct parallels to McEwan's life, particularly the story of his brother.  The plot meanders, sways, dips, and rises. The protagonist loves, loses, and mourns characters he loves and knows intimately, but we do not know them at all well and so the fuss leaves the reader a bit confused and, at times, is within shouting distance of the maudlin.<br /><br />But this is McEwan, and he is a brilliant intellect and a great writer. There is something very interesting going on in the parallel not only between the protagonist and his brother Robert but bewteen the former and his wife Alissa, a kind of doppelganger dynamic concerning what turns out to be and what might have been, not unlike what Henry James treats in The Jolly Corner. McEwan's protagonist is a precocious and brilliantly talented artist who accomplishes nothing, while his wife, who is less obviously talented at first, becomes a great and famous artist. To do so she trades in her life. He retains his, such as it is.<br /><br />I think McEwan is one of the very best writers writing in English today, but there is something amiss here. It's almost as though he felt he had to write this book. It isn't up to his high standard.",3.0,0,2022

Insufferable,"*********some spoilers contained below************<br />Hmm, I really liked Boyfriend Material and was excited for this book, but honestly I found the twins insufferable and found it a bit aphobic. I wanted to like it; was so excited for it. But between Bonny being kind of a manic pixie dream boy and Valentine being abused by every single character from the start to the finish (with the exception of his mother) including himself it left me feeling really uncomfortable. The disdain and outright hatred (Bella literally wants to murder Valentine) for our main character was never earned by the story. If you want us to dislike Valentine so much that we'll stand for him being abused and shot and his love interest not actually caring, you really gotta show us he deserves that right. No, instead we see him as a quiet, awkward person whose only crime appears to be that he's human and not exactly like the Tarleton twins? Maybe I missed something, but I can't remember the last time I read a book and hated almost every single character in some fashion. I found myself wishing someone... anyone would tell Valentine that he deserved love and that he was worthy of love. Anyway... yeah, if you're a fan of two-sided romance, stay away from this one.",1.0,0,2022
An Amazing Book - Juliet and Christopher Revealed,"I loved reading this book. I have been reading the series and always wondered about Juliet. Why was she the eldest and had resigned herself to spinsterhood and spend all her time as a companion to her grandmother Edie. I always wondered why she was so quiet and withdrawn. Well, this book explains it all. Her heartbreak when the dearest best friend of her life Christopher left five years ago. He left without a word or goodbye. Now he has returned and feelings resurfaced for both of them. Each had to fight their way through their fear, doubt, rejection and secrets. And let me tell you the secrets were major. I was totally blindsided by some of them. One especially was why Christopher always felt unloved and unwanted by his parents. Shocking and painful. However, when Juliet and Christopher were able to speak the truth and be open about things that is when the magic of their romance truly began. I had a smile on my face most of the time because of the verbal back and forth between Juliet and Christopher. But especially delightful was the way they danced around the truth they felt for each other.This is a must read. I highly recommend it<br /><br />Reasons I enjoyed this book:<br />Easy-to-read<br />Happily Ever After<br />Page-turner<br />Romantic<br />Realistic<br />Unpredictable<br />Wonderful characters",5.0,1,2022
Snapped ca 1900 Has it Come to This? by Kimberly Tilley,"I had to think a lot about this book, for some reason it really reminded me of a Snapped episode on tv, ca. 1900.  It is an unsolved mystery for sure, but my mind wandered to the reality of the times.  Women couldn't vote, mostly could not get divorced and/or away from any sort of abuse in a marriage and the fact that a woman was tried by 12 men, well you get the injustice of the days!<br /><br />Similar to a Snapped episode, I was rooting for the woman, women or gun for hire that knocked off this drunk, philandering husband.  Sad, but I'm glad someone knocked him off.  I don't know that I should feel that way, he made a mistake and there is forgiveness, but I was putting myself in the wife's shoes.  Here's a man prone to drink, never home, having had an affair with a 17 year old girl who is extorting him.  Even if she could forgive him, why?  Thank goodness she had the support of her in-laws or her trial could have gone a very different way.<br /><br />I'm completely confused why the mistress was never tried it does seem that there was a misdeed in the handling of the case.  As always, Kimberly does in depth research, xevelopment and wrote a brilliant acknowledgment.  Thanks Kimberly!",5.0,1,2022
"Love the Series, Shaw James is a terrific character","Rating: 3.5🌈<br /><br />The Fix Is In is the fourth book in Mary Calmes’ Torus Investigations series and it’s probably my least favorite of the group to date.<br /><br />Surprisingly because this one sort of breaks a number of patterns set out in all the previous novels and it includes a circle of friends and support characters that I really got into.<br /><br />Shaw James, seventh son of a seventh Scottish son and Torus fixer, has been handed a new case from his boss’ idea of helping people who can’t normally afford their expensive services by doing pro bono work on a selective basis.<br /><br />His new assignment involves rainy Oregon, and a paranormal investigator that someone seems to feel might be in danger.<br /><br />The character of Shaw James is splendid . He’s not what I term a typical Calmes golden boy but I do love the character traits she gave him and the personality as well as family history that makes Shaw so interesting and attractive. He’s terrific and incredibly likable immediately.<br /><br />The small town he arrives at feels realistically sodden and uncomfortable (I’d leave).  And the towns citizens are what I’d expect of some of the Pacific Northwest small townships…quirky, interesting, a patchwork of humanity.  Calmes really does a excellent job here in getting a feel for life as in this area and it’s people.<br /><br />Even the investigations into the potential “ghostly scares” that the other main character, Benjamin Grace and tiny crew, are inquiring about, are done with equal amounts of respect, seriousness, and a smidge of humor.<br /><br />So my issue? Sigh.  It’s that for the majority of the story, I felt that Benjamin Grace is or was an absolute dunderhead.  A twit of the biggest proportions! Honestly, there were so many times I just wanted to smack him myself.  The man was as clueless as can be.  A kindergartner would have glommed onto the facts around him, seen the lightbulb going off over his head, and not been a total nit about things!<br /><br />He withholds important information from everyone all the time!<br /><br /> Outside of Monty Python, when did idiocy become so attractive?<br /><br />Good thing everyone and everything is so good that I worked overtime to ignore Benny there.  He’s not even one of the typical “golden boys” but a cousin. Many, many …… many times removed.<br /><br />Trust me, Benjamin is a character I feel just didn’t work.<br /><br />Calmes does break a pattern here with her formula for the series which makes me think she’s setting up her next novel in the series and it’s couple.<br /><br />Needed to get them out and away.<br /><br />I look forward to that one.<br /><br />I’ve enjoyed this series and if you’re a Mary Calmes fan, I know you have too.  I’ve listed the series below in case you’ve missed any.

Most energetic setup tale I've run into,"Daniel Schinhofen likes to say that he writes stories that are a ""slice of life"".  He noted this a while back after I commented about how slow his tales develop.  Much will happen.  Many conversations will be held.  And yet the actual plot progresses just a little.  There is a lot of setup for the occasional conflicts, but payoffs are never guaranteed in any one book.<br /><br />And Luck's Holdings is definitely a book without a major conflict or climax.  It does move the story as Doc Holyday and his wives leave Deep Gulch and travel to Furden to start expanding his reach.  Once there he finds new men of evil to try to thwart and new honorable me who can become allies in his quest to save the world from the forces of Darkness.  The rest of the tale hinges on him establishing himself in town and starting to uncover the secrets and evils currently oppressing the people.<br /><br />In the end there is no big fight, like there was at the end of Luck's Voice 4.  This book sets the stage for what is to come.  And it does that extremely well.  Doc is very busy, as are his wives, as they work their way into Furden society and begin to change it.  We do see Doc working hard to avoid direct conflict and instead to raise the profile of Luck by helping those who need it.  Honestly, as I write this I realize that he is more of a Messiah than I might expect and would usually dislike, but Daniel writes him as such a likeable Gary Stu that I have a hard time marking the series down.<br /><br />I've said before that I really like most of Daniel's work.  I don't think this series rises to the level of Aether's Rebirth, but I'd be willing to say that thanks to the streamlined harem this series has moved ahead of Binding Words in my opinion. (Doc has just 6 wives, Sean in Binding Words has 13+)<br /><br />Like I do with any of Daniel's series, I do affirm that you need to start at book 1 to understand all the characters, but I highly recommend this series.  Its good fun, has engaging characters, and while the plot does meander quite a bit there is a solid foundation for it, and its clear that Daniel has a deep understanding of his world and the central conflict driving it forward, which keeps the plot moving and avoids many of the pitfalls that this kind of tale can fall into.<br /><br />Try this series.",4.0,1,2022
The Most Dragony Dragons,"I have to say these have to be the most dragon-y dragons I have read in a shifter book. They are territorial, more than a little aggressive, and they collect and horde random stuff. Oh and they like shiny stuff. I really liked that about this book, that it was very much the traditional dragon archetype.<br />Ava is our heroine and I like her a lot. She sassy, especially with Baz, but she also has some insecurities. She isn’t someone who really cares about money, but rather making a way for herself on her own. She doesn’t want to be a possession, she wants to be a partner and be able to stand on her own. I also really thought that she handled the rapidly changing scenario really well, even in moments of panic. Especially given that she had a creepy stalker who is out to take her for his own.<br />Baz as a dragon was likable for me. I thought it was interesting that they went the route of having a shortage of women, and Baz already has a teenage girl dragon to take care of and now he has Ava to protect as well. He takes his job seriously when it comes to being king of the dragons. I also really liked how in this books dragons don’t really have fated mates like the other shifters, so basically his feelings he is experiencing with Ava is completely unexpected, throws him off his game, and leaves him really second guessing himself internally. And can I also say we never get to a point where Baz pushes Ava away because he doesn’t like the idea of mates, I’m glad that he is kind of an alpha hole, but not Ava.<br />I like the suspense in the book, and the stalker storyline. I thought it carried the book well and kept the pacing really nice. I liked the way the story wrapped up and I thought the author wrote the ending really well as well. Definitely an enjoyable read for me.",4.0,1,2022

one of the best,"This is one of the best short history books I've read. I liked the way it was structured, how it flowed and the subject areas covered. Having said that I confess I ""lightly"" read the sections on the various kings and royalty but spent a lot of time reading the sections on the common things of the era. The sections on clothes, food and careers of the different social groups fascinated me.<br /><br />Most of us remember from watching the Errol Fylnn movie Robin Hood what happens when you shoot the ""King's deer"" but I had not really thought through the idea that almost every forest and piece of land belonged to the upper classes so the average person couldn't really hunt anywhere in the country. So while the royal class eat meat daily, the common folks lived on bread and whatever vegetables there were. That also gives more insight as to why famines had such devastating impact on people. A side note to that is not only do droughts cause crop failure but so does too much rain as we have seen at times in the SE states. Not necessarily flooding but just so much rain the crops rot in the fields. That people didn't drink mostly water was interesting with ale and beers being consumed on a regular basis.<br /><br />There is a lot more in this book I found interesting and if I wanted a primer for the time period, this would be it! Well worth the read for anyone interested.",5.0,1,2022

The book is primarily about a murder trial of a girl who had many dark secrets. The mother of her boyfriend is the other point of view who was a woman who was physically and emotionally traumatized by her ex husband. She is also a beekeeper.

Loved This,"I really loved this book. It has a bit of everything from true crime, spirituality, brotherhood and manhood. I think it's very inspiring for young folks who may come from similar backgrounds. Raekwon is very open in this book and doesn't sugarcoat much. He seems to be a dope person and real stand up dude which is probably why he has attracted the right people in his life at the right times.<br /><br />I recently watched the Wu Tang Saga and decided to read more into them. I almost chose another member's book but then this one popped up and I was immediately sold on it. I'm glad I chose this one to read first. I appreciate that although some relationships are no longer what they were, he gives credit to those people for the things they've done that deserve recognition.  He also reflects on and is honest about some things that he could have done differently.  I think he respectfully shares group issues which is a skill when folks have played with your money.  I respect that despite having a successful solo career Raekwon did participate in some of the group projects that he didn't necessarily believe in to help out those that may not have had as much success.<br /><br />This was definitely worth the read.

Really not up to par,"Compared to the other books in this series, this one just was not good at all.  The beginning was awkward, having absolutely nothing to do with anything that's come before in the series, nor anything following the events at the opening of the story.  There were a number of typos, and the story just did not flow well at all, ending in the sorriest excuse for a cliffhanger I've ever seen in print.  It is, at its core, a collection of scenes, each of which might have made an interesting book in the series, but which were basically just jammed together with a price slapped on.  Sadly, it is extremely obvious that the author has become bored of her own characters and series has run its course.  :(",2.0,0,2022

Very Strong 4 and 1/2 Stars ⭐!,"I've had this series setting in my Unlimited for awhile now and have actually reread the description a few times, and really wanted to start it. I'm so sorry I waited this long to jump in. I haven't been able to put it down since. Go figure!<br /><br />I 've been looking for a decent book for the last few weeks. I read A LOT, and I'm getting burnt out on every single book in my preferred genre, doing 3-20+ book series lately. Everyone seems to be in that churn and burn mode lately. I even jumped around to a few different genres to see if it would help-it didn't. Lol<br /><br />I originally hoped I didn't end up regretting my decision in starting what is already showing up as a 10+ book series. I have a strong hunch that won't happen! Especially with the way this one not only wrapped up pretty much all the loose ends, but really built up for the next few books to carry along.<br /><br />So far though it's an excellent set-up for the premise, characters, and scenery. Very well written and slowly brings you into the why's, what's, and wherefore's necessary to build a successful series on.<br /><br />Although the book does take awhile to ramp up-not necessarily a bad thing-when it hits Chapter 7 ""Sisters, Sisters,"" the drama explodes on the pages and you're pulled even deeper into this storyline. And oh my-what a way for a storyline to unfold and blast off!! And it just kept getting better!<br /><br />The only issues I've had is there appears to be either a glut of British-based books being introduced into Unlimited lately, or the titles Unlimited is choosing to show me keeps flooding my ""interests preferences.""<br />Either way, I'm not familiar with a lot of the British slang, or even enough of the geography when mentioned. I'm having to constantly stop and search terms and locations to not lose the thread of the book at times. I enjoy total immersion into the entirety of the written word with what I'm reading, and the constant breaks disrupt that from happening.<br />To then add in military terms and acronyms commonly used there has caused even more complications then I typically would prefer to deal with.  It wasn't enough to turn me away from the series though.<br /><br />Highly recommend!",4.0,1,2022

Very Disappointed,"I’ve been following this saga through 17 books now, and sadly I’ve had enough.  Back in the first two books we had a 20-going-on-15-year-old Main Character who was reacting to people and events as best she can.  Now at book 17 we have a 20-going-on-15-year-old Main Character who IS STILL reacting to people and events as best she can.  Where is the character growth?  There is no evolving of anything, other than picking up more friends to stay at her Unlimited Room magic house.  (She picks up even more tenants in this book)<br /><br />I realize the author doesn’t want to write love scenes, but when there are Adults with at least two serious love interests, Adult things happen.

There were a lot of laughs to be had, which I appreciated. A lot going on with all the characters, and overall not to cliche. Not too weak; glad to see fully formed adults making decisions. Stong females. Good amount of spicy detail, and got good and dirty. The only aspect that was a real turn off--which really should be classification/trigger for books of this nature-- is pregnancy. Some people love reading about virgins, some people love pregnancy themes, some people need romance, etc.  Nice that it frames up to be a happily ever after, but ffs.. it isnt a theme I want to read about, at all. That part is cliched.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed it. Not too dramatic, not too stressful. I laughed out loud. I had good fodder for my imagination. I followed the author and will consider more books by them.",5.0,1,2022
Person writing this doesn't understand military culture/policies,"Wow.<br /><br />The idea seemed interesting.  There have been a number of amazing tales of a slightly disgraced officer exiled to a bad ship and then turning things around both on the ship and for his nation.  Its definitely a bit of a cliche, but written well these are compelling tales.<br /><br />The original write-up made this seem like it might be that, but sadly, the story was clearly written by someone who dislikes the military and lacks a real understanding of how militaries work.  There was so much in here that was just not logical on so many levels.<br /><br />The sad thing is that overall the story was solid.  The conflict was well-written and the characters were sufficiently detailed to be easy to dislike.  (I couldn't even like the main character, but he was easy to pity and hold in mild disdain.)<br /><br />Yet, the bad military elements just rubbed me the wrong way.  Add in the fact that a huge part of this story required people to be still loyal to a man who led a cult of personality and attempted coup only to be killed more than 15 years before this story.  I know some people believe that such a cult could stick around that long, but it stretched my ability to suspend my disbelief beyond any breaking point.<br /><br />Just not what I wanted.  its good enough for three stars, but that's it.",3.0,0,2022
Great book once you get past the obnoxious insults,"I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by Bill McCurry's ""Death's Collector"".  After reading a couple heavy non-fiction books, I was looking for some fun and easy reading.  I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started, but ""Death's Collector"" fit the bill on both counts.<br /><br />I initially wasn't a fan of the vulgar talk and juvenile banter present through much of the book.  Yes, I know that's the point, but there were a few spot where it was so over-the-top that it sort of pulled me out of the story, if you will.<br /><br />But the characters won me over, as did Bill's sardonic writing style.  The anti-hero of the book became more and more likable the more the story goes on, and I found myself rooting for him and his band of misfits.<br /><br />I've read too many books where they story was great until the last chapter.  Ending a book right is hard to do, but I'm happy to report that McCurry nails it.  What a great ending to a great story.  Throw in a few unexpected twists along the way, and you have an excellent way to spend the weekend.<br /><br />---------------<br />I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between the two sites.<br /><br />5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only two or three dozen in a lifetime.<br />4 - Very good.<br />3 - Worth your time but has issues.<br />2 - Not very good.<br />1 - Atrocious. (less)",4.0,1,2022
Horrible Tragedy and Rising from the Ashes,"This is a deeply moving and emotional book about a top French model who is horribly disfigured by a terrorist’s bomb. It is more than the story of her tragedy because it is also the story of hope and living again after the unthinkable happens. Veronique is a character in a story but she is also the human part of all of us who want to believe that we can once again find goodness in a cruel and angry world. The plot was moderately paced and just right for the story that was being told. The characters were all credible and likable, especially Dr. Dennis, one of Veronique’s physicians, and Veronique herself. I enjoyed how resilient and plucky she was, able to overcome the tragedy and to reach out to others. The research about HALO and innocent children being injured by land minds was gut-wrenchingly realistic and added an unexpected deep layer to the story.<br />I checked out a copy of this book from my local library using the Libby App. All opinions expressed are my own.",4.0,1,2022
Loved everything about this one!,"I read The One Night prequel recently and absolutely loved Nora and Cooper’s story but really wished for more. Well, I got it in The Reunion, plus more. I was a little nervous about reading this one as this book is told in 6 POV’s. Three couples but also relationships between 3 siblings. I wasn’t totally a fan of the multiple POV’s at first because I can’t read a book all in one sitting, so trying to keep the stories straight after having to put it down for a bit was a little hard for me, however, Meghan Quinn really made it work and I should’ve never doubted that she could. I decided that I needed to read this one as much as I could, so I didn’t forget what was going on with each sibling and I totally enjoyed it.<br /><br />Martin and Peggy Chance had three children, Ford, Cooper & Palmer. The Chance’s brought their children up with so much respect and love in the family, hoping their children will eventually end up like they have…. Still in love and ready to celebrate their 50th Anniversary. So the Chance siblings were brought back together to Marina Island to plan a party for their anniversary. Well, all would be good if the siblings still got along. Somewhere along the line, they all grew apart. Ford is always focused on work (he’s head of their family owned camping store) and trying to figure out how to rebrand the store. Cooper looks after his parents, as his dad is slowly deteriorating, so he helps around the house despite having to take the ferry across the water from his own house. And Palmer was off gallivanting around the world making IG posts about food, trying to prove she can make it on her own. Well, the Chance siblings aren’t as put together as they want the other family members to believe and it all comes out when trying to plan their parents anniversary party.<br /><br />Along with the Chance’s POV’s, there is also Beau, the doctor in Marina Island and someone Palmer has crushed on for years; Larken, Ford’s assistant and Beau’s sister and Nora, the town baker and Cooper’s ex-wife’s best friend. Meghan created this story in a way that keeps you turning the pages wanting more. I loved the plot and all the twist and turns she added in this one. She had me laughing hard too. Palmer has a sassy mouth and watch out when she gets ahold of some wine. I loved how the relationships came to be between the characters and I couldn’t wait to find out why the Chance siblings no longer got along well. I’m so glad I took the chance and read this book. It kept me very entertained and I absolutely loved the ending! It definitely gave me that “complete” feeling where I don’t feel like I need to have more, although I would’ve pass up reading something later on as an update on their lives. LOL",5.0,1,2022

A fun read,"I enjoyed A Limited Run so much. Lately there have been so many reunion shows and look back podcasts for old shows. This book takes that idea and goes even further by having the original cast, twenty years older, live in character (including now-adults pretending to be teens) in a recreation of their show’s setting for ten days. They are given limited directions each day, but have no idea what their castmates have been told to do. The characters are well developed and I found that I really cared what happened to them and even felt outrage at the unfairness and gaslighting one went through. I suspected some things before they were revealed, but totally missed others. One character had me totally puzzled by her actions and wanting to know what her motivation was and where her knowledge came from is largely what made the book hard to put down. I very highly recommend this book to people who enjoy those reunions shows and podcasts. It’s a very fun read!",5.0,1,2022
Clean. Fun. But Characters Seemed Flat.,"Overall, I liked the story. I loved that it was clean without profanity and sexual content. There was a bit of romance, but it developed oddly...still clean. What I found most distressing was the interaction of the characters. The way they made decisions seemed unrealistic and interactions between characters seemed...forced.<br /><br />One of the main characters is suspicious of an ally but for reasons I couldn't quite understand. He too was keeping secrets and he begrudged the other character for keeping secrets. Baffling. This theme seemed to exist between many of the characters.<br /><br />The book has no real resolution. It is meant to continue on to the next book, which is okay if you know that going into it. The title of the book led me to believe they would at least find the ""Bow of Destiny,"" but no, they instead went after a book which they retrieved relatively easily and the book seemed to have no bearing on the story. The good guys were worried about the bad guys having it, but the bad guys didn't seem to care and allowed it to be regained. The good guys then never used the book, but risked their lives for it. Quite confusing, but perhaps it was all meant to be resolved in the next book.<br /><br />It was well written with some missed editing here and there. But because I couldn't really care about the characters, I doubt I'll read the next book in the series. I simply couldn't relate. I would have never made many of the decisions they did based on the information they had or reacted in the manner in which they did based on the circumstances...so I never became invested in the characters.<br /><br />But again, it was well written enough for me to read to the end, so I do think people who can relate to the characters might enjoy it. Three stars.",3.0,0,2022
Mostly dull,"The first 80% plodded along with very little to entice the reader to continue.  But, because I am a member of the ‘clean plate club’ when it comes to reading, I carried on.  By their nature, romance novels have a foregone conclusion, so things like characterization, pacing, and plot development are essential to enjoying the journey to the inevitable HEA.  My biggest complaint of the first 80% is that the characterization felt forced and flat. There wasn’t anything about the two protagonists that enticed me to care about them enough to be concerned about their relationship.  Basically, this novel was a study in mutual lust.<br /><br />So, what about the last 20%?  By this point, both characters had satisfied their lust and began to relate to one another on a different and somewhat more interesting level.  Does this improvement make up for the somewhat dull first 80%? It does not.  So, what you’re left with is just an ‘so-so’ book.  The most original aspect of the novel was Diana’s and her sisters’ solution to making their own way after their parents’ scandalous behavior. Given the time period, I’m not sure it’s totally believable, but it was clever.",3.0,0,2022
Against All Gods,"This book was a real slog-fest. It took me literally halfway thru the book before I really felt engaged. Several times, I was very close to abandoning this.<br /><br />The gods in the book are all petulant toddlers whose entire vocabulary consists of nothing but profanity. There appears to be some foreshadowing about the gods, so I will certainly pick up the next volume when it gets released, if I remember.<br /><br />Several seemingly disconnected characters are introduced in sequential chapters but in such a way that it felt disjointed. By the time my interest developed in one character, a new one was introduced, and the prior characters weren't tied together until much later in the book. By which time, I had forgotten who was who.<br /><br />Pronoun usage was awkward and ambiguous. More than once I had to scan back and see which ""he"" was being referred. And then the random use of titles or other epithets like ""the old man"" was further confounding.<br /><br />When everyone finally meshed together was when it started to grab my attention.",3.0,0,2022
i’ve been gobbling these and,"I am sorry to have to wait for the next one. There’s lots to like about the stories. Interesting characters, especially Jason; intricate engaging plot; non-stop action, and so forth. Despite those pluses, I gave the books 4 stars for one big (imo) reason—every single time an ability gets used Shirtaloon explains the whole thing . . . This becomes incredibly infuriating over the course of 6 books. Do we really need a written definition of Every Ability Every Single Time? How about putting them all in a glossary at the back of the book instead? Especially as in general, scenes are written so the ability is clear anyway. A secondary weakness that bothers me somewhat less are the opening chapters. They tend to be clunky, though as soon as Shirtaloon gets into the groove of telling the story his writing smooths out and loses the awkwardness. Looking forward to the last book in the series, though I do wish it was coming out sooner than September.",4.0,1,2022

My favorite series by Daniel Schinhofen for a reason,"I can imagine that some people reading this book will be a bit disappointed.  Greg spends a large part of this tale away from all of his regular partners.  This book is all about his initiate year of training.  Instead of being in the Academy like in books 1 through 4 or at the Buldoun tournament like book 5, now he's stationed in a small camp a few hours march from a small town.  There the rest of the cast only contains two characters from earlier books as former sergeant Willof from the Academy is his training captain and the librarian Rafiq is there to record his growth over this book and at least the next one.<br /><br />He does get to visit with Mindie, Jenn and Yuki occasionally when his training allows him to travel to the city where he gets leave every nine weeks or so.  Those scenes are solid and keep the character growth going.<br /><br />I really have to dig to find issues with this tale.  Probably my biggest was the occasional scenes where some of his future brides get to appear in his dreams with Yuki, Mindie and Jenn.  Each of his future brides gets to describe what they discovered about themselves when they found their aether resonance.  And while these were somewhat fun, I find that Daniel allowed his need to bring in kinky sex to intrude here.  Its not excessive, but its just not something I like or really care to read about.  He's been getting a lot stronger in his writing by going away from writing out too much in the sex scenes, and to have the desires be what they were was just not necessary.<br /><br />But that's a small quibble.  The rest of the book was excellent.  We get to see Greg grow not just as a magi, but as a leader of men.  He's discovering that he's not just his powers and abilities.  And the triumphs he achieves here bode well for future books.<br /><br />I just wish we didn't now have to wait for 3 or 4 other books to come out before Daniel will return to this series.",5.0,1,2022
Endearing detective,"Before we meet one-time cop turned private investigator, Jackson Brodie, we're introduced to the cold cases that absorb him in this book: the disappearance of Olivia Land, 3, who vanished in the night while camping out in the backyard with her older sister; the murder of Laura Wyre, a beloved daughter murdered mid-day in her father's law office; and the whereabouts of Tanya Fletcher, whose mother allegedly split her father's head open with an axe because he woke up baby Tanya. The aunt who was supposed to care for her let her go into the foster case system.<br /><br />Jackson himself has a case history that author Kate Atkinson reveals throughout the book: the death of his mother when he was a child; the older sister Niamh who was assaulted and murdered; the older brother Francis who committed suicide because he should have met Niamh in the car at the bus stop that rainy day and didn't.<br /><br />Atkinson has a gift for showing how the past lives in our daily lives. Jackson is a man with a good heart and a tough life with a beloved daughter he feels protective of and an ex-wife whose priority is her own wants and needs.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable book in which seemingly impossible cold cases are solved by a detective who is a delight to spend time with.",4.0,1,2022

Rudiments of Logic,"This is an interesting book of a kind. It’s a discussion about personal philosophical foundations between two college freshmen, a conservative and a leftist, with a college senior philosophy major as a referee. It isn’t a book about who’s right. It’s about why each thinks he’s right.<br /><br />The conservative believes he is capable of making most of his decisions based on his own empirical knowledge. The leftist believes he, and his conservative friend, need to rely on the knowledge of experts, I.e. their professors. Forget what your parents taught you, the leftist says, the profs know the truth.<br /><br />My sympathies lie with the conservative. Having spent enough time in college to secure bachelor and master degrees, thus with great distrust of the non-reality based ideas that float around academia, my advice is to fortify one’s self with reality-based facts, and be one’s own expert.",5.0,1,2022
A Relaxing Bit of Fluff,"Pun intended.  I found this book more entertaining Han I expected -- and I'm not a cat lover.  I am American-Irish, though, and I picked up this book out of curiosity about the role of cats in Irish folklore.  Alas, that was only a wee part of the book.  It spent more time talking about real felines and their devoted servants and even includes a chapter on immigrating to Ireland with your feline family.  For sheer enjoyment, I would have given this book a solid four.  Unfortunately, for lack of editing, which made me stumble in a lot of places, it gets a three.  I planned to round up to a four until I read that the author is also an editor.  An editor should know the value of having at least one fresh set of professional eyes find what the author missed, possibly through familiarity with what it's supposed to say.",3.0,0,2022
I highly recommend this poetic historical fantasy about the importation of steppe ponies to Iceland,"Poet/medievalist Tolmie weaves the tale of an Icelandic trader who travels from the arctic north thru Central Asia searching for hardy horses to bring home in this charming historical novella adorned with ghosts, magic, & tribal warfare. In the 9th century, Eyvind the Viking, abandoned by his ship in Rus when he refuses baptism, joins with a fellow trader, the Jewish merchant David, hoping to get rich through horse trading. This ambition takes them along the Danube, then thru Khazaria to the grassy steppes of Mongolia, where the men meet a chieftain willing to trade some of his Mongolian ponies if Eyvind, whom the chieftain believes is a magician, will dispel the ghost of his wife Bortë, who's haunting his tribe and terrorizing his herd. With the help of Bortë's mother, Eyvind calms the ghost, who then takes the form of a beautiful white mare that no one in the tribe can see. Rewarded with 25 horses, including this mystical mare, Eyvind makes the dangerous trek back, along the way facing scavenging soldiers, bandits, & toll collectors.

Not what I thought,I was disappointed~after reading all the 5 star reviews I expected an exceptional book.  It was not.  First of all I dislike that the book was mostly about humans and very little about the octopus.  From the description It seemed the octopus was suppose to be the lead character~ he was not!  It was very simplistically written and very predictable.  I wouldn’t recommend paying more than $2.99 for this book~certainly not worth $14.99.  I feel very cheated!,2.0,0,2022
From a psychologist who worked in San Francisco - Shellenberger has nailed it!,"As a clinical psychologist who ran programs for vets for many years at the San Francisco VA Med Center (including homeless vets), I read San Fransicko with great interest.  One of Shellenberger’s primary points, with which I fervently agree, is that the very term “homeless” was coined as clever marketing to mislead the public – the people we see living on the street are mostly mentally ill and drug addicted individuals who lack (and have largely eschewed) housing due to their obvious psychopathology.  Thus, providing them “Housing First” is a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />In addition to providing an excellent history of the Bay Area politicization of homelessness, Shellenberger focuses on the ideology of the Housing First advocates who have helped perpetuate and worsen the problem in the name of compassion.  Coming from the Left, Shellenberger has a unique understanding of this ideology, which he compares to a modern religion.<br /><br />In decades of working in San Francisco,  I became very familiar with this monomaniacal ideology, in which any problem is subordinated to, and seen in the context of, a kind of Marxist conflict of oppressors versus victims. I quickly learned that this leftwing religion is based on split-off hatred and contempt for civilization itself.  When I attended substance abuse conferences in San Francisco run by community leaders, it became clear to me that these leaders had no understanding of mental health disorders like addiction – they regarded “homeless” addicts as heroes of some kind.  Thus, each drug addict defecating on the streets in the Tenderloin was a massive middle finger to some imagined white male with a briefcase.  The premise of Shellenberger’s solutions, which make so much sense, assumes that adherents to the now reigning ideology want things solved.  They do not.  They want people inconvenienced by addicts – the homeless have become symbolic sacred cows who roam society to remind the bourgeoise of the sins of capitalism.<br /><br />I recommend this book to the non-ideologically possessed who want to understand why our “Progressive” bastions seem unable to solve obvious problems calling for practical solutions like the Cal Psych proposal that Shellenberger outlines.  This is a groundbreaking work.",5.0,1,2022

Join the Fun on Poppy's and Alex's Annual Summer Trips,"Talk about a slow burn!  Emily Henry gives her readers a delight with Poppy and Alex, two friends who meet in college and discover they are from the same hometown, although they went to different high schools.  After student orientation, they don't see each other that much, but decide to ride home together during a college break.  They have trouble finding things to talk about, except that they are interested in traveling.  Poppy is the organizer who sets up a fun (but strictly  platonic) trip for them. The Summer Trip becomes an annual thing for Poppy and Alex.  They have little in common otherwise, date other people, and after one serious misunderstanding on a summer trip, stop communicating for two years.  Poppy cautiously breaks the silence via text message and is shocked when Alex replies.  Poppy is a professional traveler and social influencer living the big city life  who gets free trips for reviews. Alex has returned to Ohio where he is an English teacher living the small town life.  After the two begin to text, soon enough, another Summer Trip is planned.  Poppy strictly avoids addressing Alex  about the incident which led to them falling out of touch. This book reminds me a little of a movie I saw once starring Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn, ""Same Time Next Year.""  Throughout this book, readers will wonder, ""Will they, or won't they?""  It definitely didn't turn out the way I thought. It's a fun read, even if I did think Alex was way too sensitive, but I will discourage any readers who can't tolerate casual use of the F word or graphic descriptions of lovemaking.",4.0,1,2022
A entertaining read with a satisfying ending,"Rating: 4 🌈<br /><br />With The Kite, N.R. Walker dips her hand into the ever popular trope of the warring/competing top assassins who, for whatever reason, have to work together in order to survive.<br /><br />Their relationship goes from enemies who admire each other’s skills to friendship then love as they fight for survival.  It’s a great trope.  And it works for so many reasons.  Whether it’s in the movies, being streamed through a series, or through the various novels I’ve read recently.<br /><br />There’s action, suspense, two hot highly skilled people at the height of their careers , in this case men.  Gorgeous, of course. Each damaged by their pasts, albeit in different ways.<br /><br />It’s how each author takes this trope and puts their spin on it that interests me.<br /><br />Walker’s assassin are hit men for the government, instead of being private contractors. Well, one is. Taking on assignments that eliminates the “bad guy”.  He thinks he’s being the good guy.<br /><br />Tim “Harry” Harrigan, a truly giant of a man, works for the Australian government.  Not that he’s been home for a while.  For years he’s been the sniper called on to take out high level targets.  Make a hit, move on.<br /><br />But now he’s getting tired, not slow, but the lifestyle is wearing on him.  Harry’s weary frame of mind coupled with setting up a hit gives the reader a good idea of his personality at the moment.<br /><br />Especially when it looks that Harry is now the hunted instead of the hunter.<br /><br />The assassin to come to Harry’s aid is Asher Garin.  Asher is a hitman for hire, top in his field.  The reason he’s there is because they are both targets on everyone’s list now.<br /><br />The exciting way they are brought together, the high action and swift acknowledgment of each other under extraordinary circumstances is so much fun to read.<br /><br />Their personalities are less defined, very much the Grumpy/Sweet tag that’s employed.  The layers come later as the men flee from one destination to another, trusting each other, and the real reason behind their names on a kill list gets revealed.  It’s betrayal, greed, and , double crosses.<br /><br />The story moves rapidly.  The sex is of the angry/hot type, and the dynamics between Harry and Asher go from slow to incendiary, dislike to love.<br /><br />There’s more to this, including another main-ish character that’s an enigma for most of the story.  Totally charming, however.  We could have done with more of him in his “Charlie” voice stage.<br /><br />Overall, I found this entertaining and a quick romance/adventure read. Walker’s characters never actually came across as heartless professional assassins.  So making Henry a ex-soldier who believes he’s acting for the benefit of his government helps in her character creation. Same goes for Asher.  It’s never laid out exactly what he does and who he kills for. Just he has a talent for languages and a very damaged childhood.  So he too doesn’t feel like a hitman for hire.  Are they killing people? Yes, but those are the bad guys.  That’s expected.<br /><br />I believed in the men, if not exactly their professed careers as it were.<br /><br />One other odd element.  Walker throws in a reoccurring dream (twice) from Asher, a weirdness who’s reappearance at the end is just so out of the type of story this was supposed to be that’s it’s immediately noticeable. It almost had a narrative whiplash effect.  A spiritual woowoo, yes, we were always supposed to be together thing. What? In a killers find love action story? This paranormal aspect doesn’t happen anytime except this once so why do it at all?<br /><br />It’s like Walker couldn’t help herself, was writing a whole other book. That was a SMH moment here. Took me right out of the story.<br /><br />So, elements like those aside.  The Kite has a satisfying ending for the criminal and a heartwarming HEA for the couple.<br /><br />If anyone could make them disappear, Four could.<br /><br />And if Walker wanted to make them all reappear for a sequel, well , that works too.<br /><br />If you’re a fan of this author and a lover of this type of storylines, here’s a book for you.",4.0,1,2022
"enjoyed some elements, had issues with missing foundation","Rating: 3.25🌈<br /><br />Mother Parker , a new contemporary suspense romance novel and first in a new series by Rhys Everly, gave me several aspects I liked about the story and several I thought about that made me think potentially  this was not going to be a series for me.<br /><br />The aspects I liked about it was the multiculturalism.  Hwan and his Halmeoni, grandmother in Korean,  are the the more interesting and layered characters here.  Every part of their interactions and relationship is flavored with the depth of their culture by way of the wonderful Korean foods and teas. They meet for lunch and Halmeoni is drinking her cup of boricha.<br /><br />And it will gently be explained that it contains a sweet nuttiness of roasted barley.  Bibimbap, kimchi , and other dishes make scattered appearances. It’s a delight as is Hwan’s shop, Bubble Bubble: Bubble Tea and Beverage Shop.<br /><br />Bubble tea is explained in detail too for those unfamiliar with the beverage.  It’s Hwan’s passion as is making his business successful.<br /><br />His other companions are the crows that adopted him and his grandmother that are named after the Golden Girls.  A fun element.<br /><br />It’s with the other main character that drags the story. Parker Hawkins, ex SEAL, restarting his life after a divorce.  That and the whole island element.<br /><br />First Parker.<br /><br />His almost endless litany of “woe is me, what an unlovable idiot I am” of inflicted wounds is not only tiresome but off putting. Add to that a combative, non communicative nature and a inability initially to see anyone else’s perspective, and I can say the description Officer Grumpypants wouldn’t be the first things I’d think of calling him. Although it’s the nicest, least accurate.<br /><br />As one of the two narrators, I found him almost impossible to connect with,  especially as he yelled, stomped, insulted, argued his way into and across his way and people who got him a fresh start in life.<br /><br />The author’s intent is that we’re supposed to find Parker Hawkins attractive and think fondly of “Officer Grumpypants”?  Because, at least in my case,  the answer is no.<br /><br />Even his “redemption “ rests in the author’s placing a sort of blame on Parker’s ex’s who in the author’s storylines withstood the same appalling behavior, had a house sold out from under one, and no communication. Only to have Hwan say in a scene obviously they didn’t love Parker enough.<br /><br />That’s very misogynistic. Especially as Parker’s figured out he’s gay.  I always appreciate it when a author doesn’t blame the ex, but takes another route with respect towards new sexuality and self determination.<br />Wish that had happened here.<br /><br />Then there’s a lack of background or history about the town’s criminal elements, the background the ex SEAL s have with cleaning up the small town, and potential corrupt police force.  None of that is explained here. So zero background info on The Outpost owned by former SEAL CO Wyatt Goodman, staffed by Maddox Shepherd and Asher Ford, a new couple and ex SEALs, dog Biscuit and Parker’s sister, Autumn.<br /><br />Apparently one of the new couple was straight but Shep “ turned” him gay.  Or comments to that effect. Several borderline offensive issues here.<br /><br />- [ ] Then there’s a instant love factor that negates, narratively speaking, a strong character trait of Hwan’s.  He’s almost obsessed with his shop and it’s success.  Yet when things like , idk, clearly criminal activity happens to his shop , he acts as though it’s nothing.

*Meh*,"If you can take the never ending, unimaginative writing template of actual 20th & 21st century battles, sprinkled with ancient ones, that are molded into a screenplay using “Star Wars” faerie dust, you might enjoy the latest “Remains (Galaxy’s Edge 14)” in the ‘Galaxy Edge Reboot of Reboots Franchise Factory.’<br /><br />Not terribly bad, not very good - mediocre. Per the GE business model, this ‘episode’ takes place on a Vietnam-type jungle world (as opposed to the other routine stage - a sandbox one), with tiger-stripe camo, telepathic war dogs, and lots of fun blow ‘em & shoot ‘em up.<br /><br />The writing nuts & bolts continue to devolve, but it’s to be expected as screenwriters rarely make good book writers.<br /><br />Read via Kindle Unlimited with some Notes & Highlights On Goodreads.",2.0,0,2022
Page turner,"Eve is a mentally insecure, deranged woman who is set on making the married man, Peter, with whom her friend Leanne had an affair and his family pay for what they did that led to Leanne taking her life. Eve was in love with Leanne and though the feelings weren't reciprocated, when Leanne commits suicide because Pater opts to remain with his wife Karen and their boys, Eve using various aliases sets about her criminal intent. It matters not to her that innocent people will be hurt. She views them as collateral damage. Somewhat simplistic but nonetheless an easy and engrossing read. 4 stars.",4.0,1,2022
Lightweight,"A quick read but somewhat silly about a couple Steph and Grant and their two children Charlie and Amelia who move into a new home. While renovating they discover a message underneath the wallpaper. The first owners of the home also show up unannounced and ask if they might look around the home they vacated many years earlier. It transpires that their son William went missing from the home and was never found.<br />The estate agent who concluded the recent sale of the house, Rose, fancies Grant and his idiotic behaviour from over-drinking to commencing an affair with Rose isn't that surprising. Steph is somewhat paranoid and determined to discover what happened to William as she suspects the first owners when a hidden wall is found during the renovation process with alarming messages written thereon.<br />The story fell flat however when common sense dictates that kocking down the offending wall would have been quicker, cheaper and easier with no chance of the messages ever being found  instead of building a second wall in front of it.

well-written and controversial story,"The truth has never been more important. This is a time when our foundations of truth are being challenged. So many lies have shaken us to the core, no matter which side of the political spectrum you fall on. Is Thiaoouba Prophecy truth, as it claims? It certainly is controversial, on many levels. It is also a well-written and well-told story. Had me riveted for a few days. I know I don’t have all the answers, so, I like to keep an open mind. But some of the “facts” presented in the book directly contradict hard-earned knowledge I have gained. Zero evidence is presented in the book, yet claims to have the TRUTH and to enhance KNOWING. In my opinion, knowing cannot be enhanced without proof!! I choose to believe in my own personal experience and don’t blindly believe any suggested “facts” that are contrary to my own experience and knowledge, without convincing proof. This book stretched my mind and challenged my beliefs, which is always good. I was provided with an advance review copy for the purpose of providing an honest review.",5.0,1,2022

Horror in the Past Affects the Present,"There are so many twists in this book that I hardly know where to begin. Nora and her family move to NYC after Keith accepts a new job there. Throughout the book, I knew that Nora was hiding something from her past and I guessed what it was, but I guessed incorrectly. The red herrings totally fooled me, making this a deliciously intriguing domestic drama. With secrets everywhere and no idea who can be trusted, this book was absolutely a must-read for fans of domestic thrillers. The characters were well fleshed out, even though they had so many secrets that I never felt as though I really knew them completely until the end. Fast-paced action, a lot of melodrama and a good supporting cast of characters, too. I checked out this book from my local library using the Libby App. All opinions in this review are my own.",5.0,1,2022
"A two-thousand mile, modern-day flatboat river historical reenactment and more","I purchased and downloaded the book entitled: “Life on the Mississippi: An Epic American Adventure” by Rinker Buck while searching for a David McCullough follow up book or one similar to his 2019 book entitled: “The Pioneers” related to settling the US east of the Alleghany mountains by way of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Unfortunately, David McCullough died in 2022.<br /> This book by Rinker Buck has several threads. One of which is the history of settlement along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers by using flatboats. One story is building and sailing an actual flatboat from Pittsburgh to New Orleans to understand some of the challenges of sailing a flatboat along this course. Another story line is the challenge of recruiting and sailing with several different crews with diverse personalities, skill sets and different political persuasions to live on a flatboat together for various segments of time. Usually, the author doesn’t divulge his political leanings but sometimes he does, perhaps in the spirit and sharing that a crew has to work together to achieve a common goal even when they disagree politically.<br /> Illustrative of the style and substance of the author, Buck writes: “I DIDN’T SPEND A YEAR building a wooden flatboat and then sailing it two thousand miles down the Mississippi to New Orleans simply because I was suffering from a Huck Finn complex, although that certainly played a part… Mostly, though, I was entranced by history.”<br /> Buck writes: “The inland rivers—not the wagon ruts crossing from Missouri to Oregon—were America’s first western frontier… During the first five decades of the 19th century, more than three million migrants ventured down the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys.. to the swelling southwestern frontier. In the 1840s and 1850s, a comparative trickle—fewer than 500,000 travelers—crossed the plains west of the Missouri River by overland routes, primarily the Oregon and California trails… the western rivers in America became a floating supply chain that fueled national growth… Prior to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Mississippi acted as America’s western border, preventing expansion into the colonial empires of Spain and France.”<br /> Buck writes: “No one pursued the policy of Native American cleansing longer and more zealously than Andrew Jackson, whose presidency began with the Indian Removal Act of 1830, during which more than 125,000 members of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and several other tribes were force-marched across the Mississippi into the arid barrens of eastern Oklahoma. At least four thousand Cherokees alone died during their 1,200-mile trek west, one of the darkest chapters of American history now known as the Trail of Tears. Simultaneously, in another brutal chapter still unknown to most Americans, almost a million African American slaves were marched by foot one thousand miles over the Appalachians from the depleted tobacco plantations of Maryland and Virginia to the next source of American wealth, the sweltering cotton and sugarcane fields of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.”<br />Buck writes: “The modern Ohio and Mississippi rivers are jointly managed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers… Now I was proposing to myself that my first trip as a boat captain would be to negotiate two thousand miles of some of America’s most notoriously dangerous waters. Two of my brothers, Coast Guard veterans, laughed hysterically when I told them about my plans…. “Rinker, you don’t know knots, and you won’t be able to tie up in time,” Nick said. “You’re going to die.” That quickly became the dirge, the theme song written in advance, for my trip. I was going to die.”<br /> Buck writes: “Swelled by immigration, especially after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe in 1815 and the Irish potato famine in the 1840s, the U.S. population would boom eightfold, from 4 million after the Revolution to 32 million by 1861…. the French and Indian War in the 1760s had introduced Americans to the rich possibilities of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. A quarter century later, the success of the Revolution liberated Americans from the patronizing and politically inept British crown, and by 1790 the compass had shifted in a perpendicular direction… even as late as 1815, “heavy wagons drawn along common roads or turnpikes by four-and-six-horse teams provided the only means of moving bulk goods over appreciable distances by land. It is hard to realize how prohibitively expensive was such transportation.””<br /> Buck writes: “After 1788, when the federal government issued the first land warrants in the West for Revolutionary War veterans, more than five thousand veterans from Virginia alone, including Abraham Lincoln’s grandfather, headed over the mountains with their families on these floating farms, plying the Indiana and Kentucky banks of the Ohio and its tributaries in search of likely homesites to clear… The Kentucky arks helped promote the idea of salvageability. Taking the boat apart after the river trip and selling the wooden decks and framing timbers as construction lumber became a welcome means of recovering the largest cost that Indiana or Kentucky settlers incurred on the trip—the price of their boat.”<br /> Buck writes: “Gloria … seemed to suffer from a syndrome that causes uninformed people to confidently sound off on subjects they know nothing about.<br />for example, that Taylor Swift “couldn’t sing,” and [views on political figures]… I would have to ignore a lot to get to New Orleans with the menagerie of personalities aboard the Patience… Their personality clash went way beyond the parking lot near miss. Their DNA derived from distant planets… Incompatible doesn’t begin to describe their feverish animus for each other—they were Sophia Loren on a blind date with Billy Graham. When they first clashed, I thought to myself: Oh, what a fun trip we are going to have here. Rinker, as a human resources manager, you are first class… The many and evident eccentricities of my crew prompted me to return to a subject I had reflected upon almost from the day I decided to build a flatboat and sail to New Orleans. How would… I lead, especially captaining a boat? I had always defaulted toward a laissez-faire approach to leadership, favoring a style that mostly stressed enabling people to make decisions on their own according to their strengths, and not issuing a lot of explicit commands.”<br /> Buck writes: “Historians have generally depicted the great migration west as a process of removing the excess energy of the heavily populated East. The unemployed, the dreamers, the swindlers, and gunslingers whose personalities were unsuitable for the settled society of the East found a culture more suitable in the violent, unpredictable West… The mash of characters that I’d gathered would turn the Patience into my own private microcosm of America floating… downriver.”<br /> Buck writes: “Barge traffic was my biggest worry… Tugboat captains, like airline pilots, are notoriously unwilling to bother with radio communications with smaller, private craft in their way, and the rule of the river is to avoid needless radio chatter. They can call me; I don’t hail them… The Coast Guard is legally entitled to pull these boats off the river as a “hazard to navigation,” based on just a single captain’s report… The civilian staff that runs the Army Corps of Engineers dams can release enormous amounts of water at night, to improve the depth of the channel underneath the sail line. These nighttime water releases could dramatically affect current and change the position of my boat.”<br /> Buck writes: “A succession of presidents in the early republic—from Thomas Jefferson in 1802 to James Polk in 1849—objected to the use of federal funds for what they considered river projects that benefited only individual states… In antebellum America, the big flywheel driving the economy was cotton, and “Cotton was King.” But the same might have been said for coal. By 1880, America was extracting 80 million tons of coal a year, and most of it reached distant markets along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers… Today, the Army Corps, with thirty-seven thousand employees and a $ 5 billion budget, presides over an inland empire of hydroelectric plants, more than 250 river locks, Superfund mitigation sites, and a fleet of dredging boats that keep the river channels clear by relocating 250 million cubic yards of silt a year… Today, the Army Corps, with thirty-seven thousand employees and a $ 5 billion budget, presides over an inland empire of hydroelectric plants, more than 250 river locks, Superfund mitigation sites, and a fleet of dredging boats that keep the river channels clear by relocating 250 million cubic yards of silt a year.”<br /> Buck writes: “The colonial New France territory, roughly following the Mississippi drainage, was vast, stretching from Hudson’s Bay in Canada south to New Orleans, and the impact of French still resonates… Thirty percent of today’s spoken English, about seven thousand words, derives from French vocabulary,.. Their impact on common nouns and place names in American English was enhanced by their willingness to intermarry with indigenous tribes and learn their languages, and then import native words into French that, over time, were assimilated into English.”<br /> Buck writes: “He personified a favorite quote of mine, from Ulysses S. Grant. “The most confident critics are generally those who know the least about the matter.”<br />Because the latest government charts were often ten or more years old, I couldn’t rely on them for the location and size of shoals and sandbars ahead of us. When my cell phone reception was good, I could call up Google Earth or a U.S. Geological Survey website to check their data, which was usually only two or so months old.”<br /> Buck writes: “I realized that I had completely missed the clear signs of the death rattle of coal… The decline of coal was probably the most dramatic historic shift that we saw on the trip. Hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling for natural gas over the past decade, mostly just over the mountains in Pennsylvania, had unleashed a massive<br />oversupply of natural gas that was a far-cheaper and less environmentally destructive fuel for making electricity. Energy producers from the Tennessee Valley Authority to the Ohio Power Company had led a retreat from coal that had reduced mining in the Appalachians by 45 percent over the previous decade… By 2017, five of the largest coal companies in America had declared bankruptcy, and several coal company executives were facing federal criminal charges for bank fraud and conspiracy to violate employee-safety rules. Washington hadn’t destroyed the coal industry. Management myopia and greed had destroyed the coal industry… As a result, there isn’t a single coal-fired plant planned by an electrical utility in the United States today, and employment in the mines has dropped nationally from just under 200,000 jobs in the late 1980s to barely 50,000 today. At its peak, “King Coal” had employed nearly a million people in the 1920s, making the Ohio River valley an energy powerhouse, vital to the American economy. But today the barges mounded high with tons of sooty black lumps that I saw passing by were remnants, symbols of a dying industry. Blaming Washington and the Clean Power Plan for the death of coal was a refrain we would hear all the way down the Ohio, and it didn’t have to be true to be widely believed… Cheaper and cleaner gas had already made it a more desirable alternative to coal, and after 2008 the boom in renewable forms of energy—hydropower, solar, and wind—was dramatically changing electricity generation. On the Ohio alone, three major lock and dam systems were being rebuilt to accommodate hydropower turbines. By 2019, renewables were already generating 11 percent of American power, compared to coal’s 13 percent. Natural gas was producing 34 percent. The future was already obvious.”<br /> Buck writes: “The large family of William Chapman, a Shakespearean troupe from England, spent the 1830s drifting downriver every summer, stopping at river towns, or the floating villages of flatboats bunched together along the banks, performing Othello and The Taming of the Shrew in an amphitheater with a capacity of 120 seats, built on top of a hundred-foot barge.”<br /> Buck writes: ““When discovery was made of the salt springs of the Kanawha and the Holston [in Tennessee], and Kentucky,” Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in his famous frontier thesis, “the West began to be freed from dependence on the coast. It was part of the effect of finding these salt springs that enabled settlement to cross the mountains.”… The Kanawha salt mines are controversial today because, under brutally inhumane conditions, slave labor was used to work the pits—one of the few instances where the southern plantation system was adapted to an industrial or mining setting. Life was cruel for the roughly three thousand slaves who worked the Kanawha Salines. The saltworks were run twenty-four hours a day most of the year, to avoid the inefficiency of shutting down and restarting coal furnaces every day, and a “task system” established strict quotas for how many bushels of coal, or baskets of salt, each slave had to produce… Well before the Civil War, the Kanawha River and its flatboats became a microcosm of America’s conflict over slavery.”<br /> Buck writes: “In 1851, the German-American artist and portraitist Emanuel Leutze immortalized the surprise Revolutionary War attack on Trenton with his inspiring oil painting Washington Crossing the Delaware. The Leutze painting is considered a masterpiece of historical art,… In 2011, Mort Künstler, who is known as America’s foremost historical painter, was commissioned to paint a more accurate image of the crossing for an unveiling at the New-York Historical Society… Künstler’s canvas, which won raves from historians and art critics alike, depicts a less heroic but still determined Washington standing on the square bow of a flatboat,… How we remember history is as important as history itself, and the story of the two paintings, created 160 years apart, shows how the hoarfrost of mythmaking and edited detail can obscure our real past.<br />While an estimated 6,200 Americans were killed on the battlefield, more than 17,000 Continental soldiers died of malnutrition and disease.”<br /> Buck writes: “The clamor to occupy the rich new soils of the inland river country began even before the American Revolution was over. Squatters, Continental army veterans anticipating land grants for their military service, fur trappers, and even organized-church groups had been trickling through the Cumberland Gap and down the Ohio in flatboats as early as the 1770s. This trickle became a flood by the 1790s. Skirmishes between the scruffy bands of white pioneers and the indigenous tribes over land use boiled over into massacres, and then revenge massacres committed by both sides. The chaotic situation in the West, and the federal government’s realization that it couldn’t… restrain its own citizens as they streamed over the Appalachians, ignited the Northwest Indian War, a bloody conflict against a confederation of Shawnees, Delawares, and Creeks that would drag on for ten years after the Revolution… As soon as the disruptive waves of white settlers got into trouble, the central government intervened on their behalf, sending troops, building forts, and militarily subjugating the tribes… The inland river tribes had long been accustomed to the presence of non-native Europeans. But these were mostly French trappers, who traveled in small, nonthreatening groups of canoes, and who were more than willing to intermarry with the tribes, live together, and share both the work and the bounties of building fur-trading villages together. For a generation or more, the inland river country of Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky became a network of mixed-race fur-trapping hamlets generally free of conflict. But this changed dramatically during and just after the Revolution, when large expeditions of flatboats began to arrive south of the Ohio River. The new arrivals were predominantly English-speaking Virginians, intent on permanently settling the land for farming… Recurrent epidemics of smallpox and rubella sweeping through tribal lands turned initially friendly villagers into hostile warriors, and the decimation weakened tribal resistance to the white invasion… Historian William Heath has estimated that between the late 1780s and the early 1790s, more than five hundred settlers were killed along the Ohio when their flatboats were ambushed by Native American warriors.”<br /> Buck writes: “Thanks to Jackson and his treaties, southern cotton and sugarcane growers had obtained millions of new acres to plant. Within a decade, Jackson, now the most celebrated American general since George Washington, would ride his military fame into the White House… the Georgia legislature promptly passed legislation establishing a lottery to distribute the native land to the white miners, and forbidding Cherokees from claiming legal title to land or mining for gold. The Georgia legislature had endorsed a massive land grab… Jackson wasted no time affirming Georgia’s actions. He spent his first year as president, 1829, methodically laying the groundwork for what would eventually be called the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which provided for native lands in the southeastern states to be exchanged for lands in a new “Indian Territory” along the arid plains of Oklahoma.”<br /> Buck writes: “U.S. Army troops and state militia forced between 80,000 and 100,000 members of the five tribes from their homes… Cholera, dysentery, and whooping cough raged through the flatboats and camping spots along the journey. Overall, among the five southwestern tribes, almost a quarter of the marchers, an estimated 16,000 to 24,000 people, died.”<br /> Buck writes: “THE MOUTH OF THE OHIO at its confluence with the Mississippi, at Cairo, Illinois, is almost one mile wide. The merging of the rivers spreads a massive, triangular fan of rippling water and sandbars to the banks of three states—Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri… But the hydrological wonder at the confluence is deceptive. The riverway leading to the Mississippi is actually a narrow, man-made chute. More than 50 percent of America’s agricultural exports, corn, soybeans, and vegetable oils, and 35 percent of America’s basic industrial products, finished steel, scrap iron, crude oil, sand, and cement, passes through this space to reach the great global port one thousand miles downriver at New Orleans… More than 1,500 barges, often packaged in strings of forty-two or more, move south along the Mississippi during an average week, while more than a thousand mostly empty barges pass them going upriver… I was on the lower Mississippi now. There were no locks and dams for the next one thousand miles, and thus no lockmasters raising or lowering water levels after dark. The stronger, natural flow of the river took care of depths. The water below me would remain fairly consistent overnight… The local off-duty cops, of course, were appalled when they learned that I was traveling the river unarmed, doubly appalled when I… refused their offers of free guns.”<br /> Buck writes: “if I ran aground on the sandbars, my trip would be over.<br />under regulations devoted to maintaining the commercial waterways, the U.S. Coast Guard would declare my boat a “hazard to navigation,” drag it away by salvage boat, and have it destroyed… But now that I had spent two months traveling more than a thousand miles of the Ohio and the Mississippi, I considered this information suspect. In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are inept at policing America’s waterways and have never displayed much interest in maintaining either a safe or clean environment for boat traffic.”",4.0,1,2022
Saving Yourself by Saving Puppies,"""Seven Perfect Things,"" by Catherine Ryan Hyde, is the charming story of a high school girl named Abby who rescues seven puppies from being drowned in a river. She takes them to the local animal shelter only to discover that the puppies would be scheduled for euthanasia within a few days, as the shelter was over capacity. Taking the pups to her home is not an option.  Even if there had been room at their house, her bully of a father would never have allowed it. Abby takes off for a seemingly abandoned hunting cabin that she and her girlfriend Jamie had discovered some time ago. Abby ensconces the dogs in a shed on the property, returning each day with food and to clean up the mess the dogs created.  Abby is only able to maintain her secret for so long.  Eventually, Elliott, the owner of the cabin, returns to stay for a while, and Abby's mother Mary grows suspicious of her daughter's strange hours.<br /><br />Elliott is grieving the recent loss of his wife. He had been her caretaker as she died from Alzheimer's. Mary is very unhappy in her marriage.  She has been saving up money in hopes that she could afford for Abby and herself to leave the all-controlling Stan. When Stan discovers Mary's stash of cash in a sock, he interrogates her, but Mary says she is saving it for a birthday present for him.  He is unconvinced and tightens the chains a little more.<br /><br />After Abby's secret about the dogs becomes known to both Elliott and Mary, they encourage Abby and support her with monetary gifts and jobs to earn money to buy food and supplies. Elliott helps Abby learn how to train dogs.  Abby becomes attached to them but realizes that keeping all seven is probably not going to work out. Elliott and Mary grow close, bonding over their admiration of Abby's sense of responsibility and their own fondness for the dogs. There is no romance in the relationship at this point, but Stan cannot fathom his wife being friends with a man, so he packs up Abby and Mary against their will and drives to another state where they are forced to stay with Stan's brother and sister-in-law, who lock Abby in a room and tell neither of them to leave the premises. With the help of Mary's friend Viv and her law enforcement boyfriend, Mary and Abby finally break away from Stan's control.  Elliott has a large house where they can keep the dogs and all maintain separate rooms. It is all very pleasant and perhaps a little too coincidentally mutually beneficial for some readers to swallow, but I enjoyed it.  No relationships were engraved in stone in the final chapters, but some very appealing connections seemed to be looming on the horizon, especially now that Stan had taken himself out of the picture. This is a good book to read when you need a pick-me-up.",4.0,1,2022

Who am I?,"A young lady's journey in discovering her roots; who her father and mother were; if they still lived; did she have any siblings? It began with a incomplete deathbed confession and a two-year-old letter. Cassandra life was in turmoil. The woman she thought of as a mother, Mrs. Denton, had kept the names of her parents from her as well as an important letter. As Mrs. Denton was dying, she gave Cassandra the letter but nothing more. After she passed Cassandra followed up on the invitation in the letter to Briarton Park.<br /><br />This reminded me of a soap opera. There are several characters all with different intents on Cassandra. I liked Betsy. She was real, sincere and truthful. Kind to a fault. A gossip yes but she owned a heart of gold. A good and true friend.<br /><br />James a gentleman in every sense of the word. He had honor, integrity and good instincts. His sister Rachel a teenager on the cusp of womanhood truly embraced Cassandra's friendship and because of Cassandra became involved in the local church’s charity rounds. Rachel began to meet other young ladies her age there and was the better for it.<br /><br />Mr. North the vicar seemed all that was good and kind; was a strong speaker and was well liked in the village. But the more Cassandra got to know him, she began to believe there was more to him than what meets the eye and she was not sure if she liked it or not or whether it mattered at all. Everyone has their flaws and faults. Right?<br /><br />The kindly Mr. William Longham he was the man of business for the person that wrote the letter to Cassandra in the beginning of the story. He was a sincere, loyal solicitor who had been looking for Cassandra for about two years. He was a professional at his craft. He knew what he was about and took great satisfaction in knowing that his employer's wishes would be fulfilled now that he found her.<br /><br />Thus began the intrigue, the rumors, the suspicions, the betrayals, murder and danger for Cassandra.<br /><br />A clean romance. An easy read. It gently immerses the reader into the story and it will hold your attention till the very end. I enjoyed reading this a great deal. It is a story well presented, logical and each scene segued into another seamlessly. There were no interruptions in the flow of the story. It is professionally written and well edited.

"great themes, stilted dialogue","Rating: 3.25🌈<br /><br />““Okay, I understand.” “Good. I take my leave now.” “Thanks for coming.” “I will always come when you ask. I’ll see you soon.” “Yes, you will see me soon.” The cat disappears into a slight mist.”<br /><br />— The Witch's Power Play (Covens of Eaton Falls Book 2) by Mia Monroe<br /><br />There’s just so much I want to like about this series and story.  Monroe is pulling together a interesting history of interwoven supernatural mating and wars, of inter-species bonding and Gods intervention.<br /><br />All so fascinating that I really want to know where the author is taking the series.<br /><br />But to navigate through the process of untangling the story threads, a reader must decide what’s their tolerance for characters whose dialogue is either so stilted or so overblown as to take a reader away from the story.<br /><br />Leo and, here, Presley, the witches, are constantly “giggling “.  That word is ever present.  They had their heads together, giggling.  He giggled.  They giggled.  Nonstop giggling. They also twirl, and just have personalities that, frankly, swing from varying degrees of maturity.<br /><br />The vampires verbiage is oddly both a combination of something that supposedly sounds “old “ while also trying for hip.  If you know what I mean.  A strange unwieldy thing that doesn’t work.<br /><br />Plus they go around carrying their witches as though they were young women from a bodice ripper.<br /><br />While saying things like ‘I’m strangely attracted to him.I think of nothing else.’  Soooo many clichés here.<br /><br />The characters themselves have real promise.  Presley and Beto? Great dynamics and background. But you need to basically put them on mute after a while because it’s just to much.  There’s a nice element of D/s here that is unexpected.  But  also a eye roll bit with the color pink .  So for every one good thing that gets included, there’s bound to be another that’s zany.<br /><br />There’s also a villain called The Beautiful One.<br /><br />So.  I breezed through this.  Next time , if I continue, I’ll have to find a way to mitigate the dialogue and  words that seem to populate like bunnies.<br /><br />In the meantime, for those of you who adore this author, I’m sure you’ll have read it or it’s on your TBR list.  It does have some really interesting themes going forward.<br /><br />Want to know how it’s going?

imaginative elements brought down by a TSTL MC,"Rating: 3 🌈<br /><br />Based on the description, Obsidian Island easily fits into the historical gothic horror genre that’s wonderfully scary stuff to read.  Especially if it’s well written, with a subliminal message of dread building along with suspenseful actions flowing through the storylines.  Coming from the author of the wonderful Flos Magicae Universe stories, I had high expectations.<br /><br />Obsidian Island comes close as it contains so many of the classic elements of the genre.  There’s a shipwreck, a mysterious island full of wildly unimaginable plants and animals never seen anywhere before, and disquieting dreams that invade the minds of those within the island’s territory.<br /><br />Obsidian Island’s biggest weakness lies not in its storylines but in one of its main characters.  That’s the explorer biologist Emery Lapwing.<br /><br />Emery is part of a crew of college friends that are sailing together on The Achillean, a frigate captained by a man he’s adored secretly for years, James Rawlings. Along with them are a ship’s doctor, Deaton, a man with his own demons, and a baker, Lucian.<br /><br />There’s a considerable amount of unannounced romance and passion for the people within that quartet of men, more so given the nebulous time frame of 1800ish England. Definitely when same sex relations could see you imprisoned.<br /><br />But the characters don’t come with much history or depth of personality. That’s a issue because it’s hard to care about them, especially when the author has set one up to be such a idiot.<br /><br />Lapwing consistently runs towards danger here.  It doesn’t matter that his fellow shipmates/friends are telling him it feels wrong or something isn’t right, off he charges.  He disregards every type of warnings that come his way. There’s ominous dreams,  obvious and subtle portent signs of death, even when a bird tries to pull him back to the shoreline away from the weird interior, does he listen? No.  Also the bird is the size of a human and befriends him immediately. Huh.<br /><br />Instead its into a deep, dark, unexplored cave when the tides are incoming. Or run to a looming tree that’s blood red and smells of death.<br /><br />Honestly, the author’s endowed Emery with the common sense and survival skills of a kumquat.<br /><br />As the others follow him into increasingly horrifying situations, only towards the end does it enter his mind that perhaps he’s to blame for every wrong move, and he’s got everything all wrong. Ya think?<br /><br />I’m not sure why Powell’s narrative is so focused on such a character. He’s not one to connect with.  The poor decisions he makes puts everyone in near death situations that he makes little apologies for until the last moments.<br /><br />The romances, such as they are or can be for that era when it’s illegal, come briefly towards the end of the book and consist of chaste kisses.<br /><br />James, Deaton, even the baker, Lucian , are far more relatable characters then Emery in their emotional reaction to the island, the strange things they see, and the ominous scenes before them.<br /><br />There’s a ludicrous element with a sea monster. But perhaps that’s in keeping with the island.<br /><br />The rating teetered between 2.5 and 3 here. Powell’s imaginative elements on the island, the butterflies and caterpillar idea was intriguing, but something was lost in the animal carryover.  There’s a hole in the process there when you catch it.<br /><br />Then there’s the ending.  Powell didn’t stick the ending, imo.<br /><br />It involved Emery, of course.  He’s not just an explorer but a biologist. So supposedly he knows about seeds , water, reproduction, destruction.<br /><br />Apparently not.<br /><br />Or maybe he’s just a another TSTL character.  Doing TSTL things.<br /><br />Like he did the entire story.<br /><br />Obsidian Island by Arden Powell isn’t one of those stories I’m recommending unless you’re a fan of this author or a die hard collector of this genre.<br /><br />Great cover though.",3.0,0,2022

caught between YA and adult,"So this book is a bit weird for me. It isn’t really a romance. It fits better in the fantasy section (yes there is a lot of talk about hard bodies and how pretty the boys are but it’s not romance. Lust and sex does not a romance make) however, it’s not a bad story, even though I want to hit Both the Vega twins over the head with a brick or other hard object. If you are a survivor, survive. If you are clever, do more than wait for the world to hit you. Hit back, learn, something. Oh, and since the twins are in fact fae royalty I expect them to Also be strong so why are they getting tossed around so much. As for why a three star rating? Because it reads like a Ya novel and it is not billed as one. The characters are in a sort of college boarding school for fae where it’s ok to kill…sometimes. And torture…sometimes. I prefer my magic systems more developed less plot wish fulfillment, and I’m baffled as to why the twins can blast the room one minute then get chomped on the next. Next, I’ve Never been a fan of rape fantasy novels and this one treads that line Hard. It is certainly filled with sexual assault against the twins, and general abuse. Hence why it is definitely not a romance but also not YA even though the instant lust, boarding school petty teen angst vibe is strong in the story. I’m invested enough to want to see what happens next but unless more substance is injected into the story then I’m not sure I will be continuing the series.",3.0,0,2022
Loved first 2 books but third book widens out to create almost an entirely different story,"I really liked this series.  At least 1 and 2 of it. 3 is a trial.  I confess I haven't read other series so maybe some of this great branching out is to match narratives with other books.  Still, I found it annoying.<br />***** Spoilers from here *****<br />In the first two books the greatest threat known is Shet and it is all about the threat of his escaping his restraints and destroying the world.  Plus the awakening of Shokan and Sira of course which continues through book 3 as you would expect.  But suddenly in book 3 Shet is reduced almost to a minor player as the stage is set for an even greater threat.  And then a multitude of different groups and factions suddenly come into existence, all of which we need to follow.<br />This quickly became unwieldly and I had trouble following who was what etc.<br />I also disliked the first part of book 3 as it became overly romantic and that's not what I read fantasy for. (I am only half way through so hopefully there is less of this as I read on - if I read on). I am ok with a hint of romance as per the first two books but I don't want the romance to consume the story.  If I want to read a romance I will read a romance.<br />I just wish the author had stuck to the original script.",3.0,0,2022
Helps in understanding Isaiah better,"I just finished reading Isaiah as part of my Bible in a Year reading plan. It’s difficult to get through and I will reread it, this novella helps you to understand Isaiah a little better. It’s nice that it interweaves both Isaiah’s story in 2 Chronicles as well as the book of Isaiah. It helps in understanding better and leads you to your Bible to look up the verses and understand them better! In my opinion Biblical Fiction should always lead you to dig deeper in the Word!<br />I also really like the authors conviction of more of God and less of me by using the lower case i, recently God has also told me more of Him and less of me. I’m trying to live it out in the best way possible for me. It’s nice to see someone who has this conviction and leading it out in such a huge way! It’s inspiring! Thank you!",5.0,1,2022
Dangerous and twisted plot,"Oath of Possession, by Jane Henry, is the sixth novel in the series Deviant Doms, a Dark Mafia Romance which focuses on the Rossi family located in the Boston area on the East Coast. This novel starts right in the action with Dario DeRocco, Capo of the Rossi Mafia family, in a car with two prisoners: Vivia Montavio, younger sister of Mantavio brothers and cousin to the Rossi family; and her male “acquaintance” Gary.<br /><br />Dario is gridlocked in traffic with two prisoners and receives a phone call from Romeo informing him that the ride to home (the Castle) will take three hours. Dario wonders if they were tailed, so Dario then calls Orlando looking for an off-the-grid place he can take his prisoners until the traffic clears. Orlando suggests his restaurant the Eatalia, which is closed, but it has a meat locker which locks from the outside and makes it handy for interrogating prisoners. Dario has been watching interaction between Gary and Vivia-- for both his job and a personal factor toward Vivia. Gary seems cold toward Vivia and implies that she set the whole plan up to kidnap Marialena Rossi. In contrast, Vivia is shocked and genuinely angry by Gary’s accusation. This irritates Dario but as he continues his interrogation, he angrily reacts with several punches to Gary. Vivia begins to cry that she would never hurt her cousin Marialena who is family. Dario is interrupted by a phone call which tells him to leave quickly because someone is after them. He quickly exits the restaurant throwing Gary in the back seat and putting Vivia in the front seat by his side.<br /><br />As Dario maneuvers the car through Boston traffic, they attempt to escape when gunshots start peppering the vehicle. Some shots bounce off since it is an armored car. Dario switches seats with Vivia and makes her drive as he starts shooting at the three cars tailing them. A few strays get through weak points in the glass and hit Gary’s head. Vivia runs out of road to drive on due to construction, so she and Dario are forced to take off on foot as he pulls her protectively behind him. He killed nine men, but three are still left. Dario is then grazed in the head by one shot. Three men disarm Dario and Vivia gets drugged with a shot to the neck. When they awaken, Dario and Vivia find themselves prisoner in an unknown location near water, so probably a wharf. When they get their bearings, they activate the transponder which Vivia put in her clothes. Soon Orlando arrives and saves them from their captors. Vivia is put in Orlando’s vehicle next to Dario where she is handcuffed and blindfolded. Orlando tells his cousin that the charges against her are serious and that the Montavios and Rossis are not happy with her. Vivia fully knows how precarious her current situation is when she finds herself left at a rustic cabin  in an undisclosed location in a forest with Dario, while the Montavios and Rossis think both she and Dario are dead.<br /><br />Dario soon starts his interrogation of Vivia beginning with some personal questions about her life with the Montavio family. He prefaces his questions with the fact that it is important that she be perfectly honest with him. Dario is doing his interrogation “job” that the Rossi family directed him to do, but slowly Dario begins to feel protective, gentle, and lustful over Vivia, his so-called prisoner. Over the coming days, their conflicted relationship begins to morph into something more primal and loving. Both are conflicted. Vivia knows Dario is a dangerous made-man in the Rossi Mafia and is there to do his “job.” Dario knows that Vivia is in deep trouble with her family and since they have “disowned” her for the kidnap plot regarding Marialena. However, it troubles him what the Montavios will do when they find out that Vivia willing gave her virginity to Gary, a guy who merely used her. Without her virginity, she is no longer of “value” to the Montavio family; as a result, they will most likely marry her off to someone with little care about her happiness. This thought is disconcerting to Dario.<br /><br />Before future plans and actions can be discussed, a major plot twist strikes, and changes everything. Like a Master weaver, Jane Henry weaves her characters into a dangerous and complex plot. While her words keep you transfixed, you will be mesmerized throughout the read.",5.0,1,2022

Heads up cliffhanger,I'm so irritated by cliffhanger books. It isn't even a book. It is chapters. The author holds a ransom over your head to get a few more dollars in the guise of a whole new book. Good story though but I will not be purchasing the next one.,4.0,1,2022
A feel good beach read,"Ivy and Shelly's adventures are fun and sweet. Yes, they have problems, but they're both generally optimistic. They have a wonderful large family that pulls them in and supports them, and of course, hunky men for possible romances.<br /><br />What's more, they discover a mystery inside the historic house Ivy inherits from her recently deceased husband. I love how Ms. Moran mixes in history and the art world into her stories. We get to learn about five female artists who were not well known, as well as the female architect Julia Morgan who designed Hearst castle. I like learning a small bit while reading for enjoyment and look forward to the rest of Ivy and Shelley's adventures.",5.0,1,2022

Absolutely loved every moment of this story!,"First, I want to start out by saying how much I love Alice's character. Too often when reading a fantasy novel, a female MC will feel attracted to the hero but play coy, feel the need to be shy, resist because it's ""not right!,"" etc. Ugh, give me a break! It gets old, fast. Alice, though? Alice is my girl! She's totally honest with herself, knows what she wants, and is unapologetically true to herself. I. frigging. LOVE that about her! It was so completely refreshing to read about such a confident and realistic individual, and I was rooting for her from the very first minute. She is without a doubt among my top ten favorite fantasy MCs of all time. Bravo for writing such a great character, Ms. Tapscott!<br />Brahm is also a wonderful and a very swoon-worthy hero to read about!<br />On the idea of working with fae archetypes, I do have a few comments: While some of the traditional fae legends apply to these faeries, some also don't, but that's totally okay in my opinion. The concepts applied were fun and creative, and it was cool to see how several characteristics were worked in to the story (inability to lie, geas/enchantment, vows/debts, food, iron). It was fun to see which rules applied and which didn't, and it's clear the author did her research into fae mythology.<br />All in all, I had a wonderful time reading this awesome book, stayed up till 3:30 AM reading it two nights in a row, and just wish the sequel was being released sooner. Thank you Ms. Tapscott for a fun and captivating story!",5.0,1,2022

Not for me,"Honestly there’s absolutely nothing to like about either of the main characters, and really none of the side characters either. I’ve read some cheating books that make my heart pound because I’m so emotionally invested, but that wasn’t the case here at all. I felt no empathy or sympathy for anyone.<br /><br />The book is super choppy, going back and forth from the past to the present. On top of that it switches POVs, and shows the exact same scene twice from the others point of view. Super confusing at first when you’re expecting a continuation of the story but instead get a rewind and retelling of the exact same thing again.<br /><br />I’m going to assume Charlie and Lex (dumb nickname) end up together because they’re both awful human beings and don’t deserve anyone else.

Won't Finish It,"Several elements of this book drew me in -- the idea of Evelyn being a bluestocking, her ability to ride, and the stunning blood-bay Andalusian (whoa, they are big horses).  But the notion of her falling in love with her dressmaker just made me go limp.  I could NOT get past that.  I don't have a bias against dressmakers (my mother was a consummate tailor) but . . . this is just a huge stretch for me.  I'm sure there are cultures in which dressmakers are sexy but I haven't experienced it.  Her standing in front of him in her knickers and corset while he zips around with his tape measure?  No, just no and no.  The racial piece and the spiritualism piece just added more confusion and interrupted the flow I tried so hard to find.",3.0,0,2022
Story shows promise but there’s some issues,"Rating: 3🌈<br /><br />Mia Monroe is a fairly new author for me, having discovered her in a charity anthology. The cover and title humor of Never Trust A Guy With Fangs had me grabbing this book to see what the author was plotting for her series, Covens of Eatons Falls.<br /><br />This is a paranormal romance between a vampire and a witch, with the start of a overall series thread about a larger multi-species storyline. There’s suspense, action, murder, and more romances to come.<br />Stretching over 5 books total I believe. See list and note at bottom.<br /><br />The characters are nice at the beginning and luckily get stronger as the story goes on.  There’s a two person pov, but we start out with the blank slate of one.  To my mind it have been more interesting to have gotten the perspective of the one being ,at least ,who had a semblance of a foundation, so the readers had a grounding.<br /><br />No, we and Leo’s “uh , where are we? Oh, the bed of my enemy…” narrative just doesn’t seem to pull us really into the story.  The dialogue runs along the edge of head smackingly idiotic and pearl  clutching.<br /><br />It keeps on in the same way.  Hi you going to kill me. No. You going to kill me. No. You smell good.  I think I love you. Me too. But we’re Romeo and Julian of the paranormal world. Np. Love is it!<br /><br />This story and author has some terrific ideas and promise to it.  There’s a lot here that , once you get to it , is interesting enough that you want to see how it plays out.<br /><br />But there’s also enough plot holes (Leo: I can hide what’s happened, oh wait my eyes changed color! Never mind , the bad guys will never notice),silly florid language, and just plain nonsensical elements like the example above.  It just interrupts whatever connection you might have had with the characters and storylines.  And makes it that much harder to get it back.<br /><br />The second book features another couple, another witch and vampire bonding that I think has far more chemistry then this pair.  It seems to be one with a slight D/s aspect although how’s that going to play out when the witch is a scattered thinking healer (D) and the (s) is a huge vampire guard.  Huh.<br /><br />I love a great paranormal story and series.  While this has potential, there’s so much that will put a lot of readers off . So this really isn’t it for me.<br /><br />But if you adore instant love romances,  almost campy dialogue, mustache swirling villains along the line of “you can’t keep him from us”, combined with some interesting elements, then I have a book for you.<br /><br />Covens of Eaton Falls:<br />🔹Never Trust a Guy With Fangs #1<br />🔹The Witch’s Power Play #2 -May 6,2022<br />🔹Vampire’s Make Bad Roommates #3 -July 14,2022<br />🔹Cosmic Spells and Vampire Lairs #4 - January 11, 2023<br />🔹A Traitor Shows His Hand #5 - March 9, 2023<br /><br />Note:  shouldn’t the author have said A Traitor Shows THEIR Hand?

How to make a boring Mary Sue character,"The main character in this book is from the far future and during a test flight of a new spaceship drive that supposed to go faster than light, he ends up at around 300 AD on an alternate Earth where the Roman Empire lost to Carthage, but somehow managed to retreat to England and now holds a small number of cities near what is now Manchester/Liverpool while the empire of Carthage expands and has conquered London.<br /><br />Of course Carthage is evil and supported by a cult of death worshippers who run what appears to be some kind of secret police, and the main character is helped by his personal equipment and an AI implant that just happened to download all sorts of useful information in the few seconds before they fell through the wormhole that led to this world.  This makes the main character, stronger, faster and far more knowledgable than any native, and means he can offer suggestions for new technology that will allow them to win the war with Carthage.<br /><br />And then we get meetings, lots of meetings where the main character employs a scattershot approach to the improvements, trying to convince everyone to accept every improvement at once, while not caring about the potential instability he's generating.<br /><br />Honestly, I hated the main character, and hated how all his discussions ended up being vague.  Yes, I knew that improvements were possible (we've lived them in our world), but Travis Starnes never describes them or how they can be implemented, which left these meetings lacking the vibrancy they needed to be compelling.  And worse, because of the power and knowledge of the main character, he can be both an insufferable prat and a whiny milquetoast at the same time.  Its hard for me to imagine, but he was just too much of a disruption of everything, yet other than the obvious villains, he was liked and trusted by most almost instantly.<br /><br />So this while not being a harem isekai, ended up with many of the same flaws.  A character who was too powerful and yet somehow lacking in character surrounded by a plot that doesn't really give him solid characters to play against.<br /><br />I like one of the other series by Travis, but I won't be getting book 2 in this series.  It just never felt worth the time I spent reading.",2.0,0,2022
"Deserves some criticism, but honestly, its better than you might expect","Jim is not treated well by the early parts of the plot here.  He's rather abused by the environment he finds himself in, and like a few other tales where travel in a fantasy world is going to be required, the number of bandits got a bit silly.<br /><br />But you also had.... (Nope, going to leave out the spoilers.  I will say that elements of the plot had me shaking my head a bit.)<br /><br />Ok, complaints out of the way, Jim grew on me.  He actually did have some character development as did his closest companions.  They never felt like cliches bound them, despite the fact that a lazy writer could have easily failed to build them into compelling creations.<br /><br />So while I can't entirely disagree with some of the elements of the reviews giving less than 4 stars.  I honestly think that this tale rises above its flaws with some touching care shown to the main character and his friends.  This story actually drew me in and I wanted to know how things would turn out.<br /><br />This won't be for everyone as it definitely gets into numbers quite a bit, but I think lovers of LitRPG tales will find it to be a refreshing change.",4.0,1,2022
"HUmm... interesting idea, but didn't quite draw me in.","This is an interesting world with some interesting challenges.  The fact that the main character is clearly heroic in mindset, but doesn't have everyone falling over to praise him at the start was unusual for the genre.  Instead everyone seems sure that like the sheriff in High Noon, he's not going to last very long.<br /><br />It allowed the characters to develop.  For once I didn't find the female characters to be stamped out by central casting.  Instead, they had personalities and hopes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while this story shows a lot of imagination and creativity in the foundation, it just never quite managed to draw me in.  I was intrigued by the main character, but did not really find him interesting.  That somewhat puzzled me.  I wanted to like this story, but the magic never hit me.<br /><br />Its a solid story, but for some reason I can't call it a great tale.  So I leave it at 3 stars.",3.0,0,2022
Another one to grab your heart,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this book. So far, I've liked everything I've read of Kait Nolan's, so I indiscriminately grabbed two or three more books to keep me company when I wanted to relax.  This one was perfect.<br /><br />When it says older woman, I will say not that much. And it is friends to lovers only because the heroine is blind to the man right beside her. The plot is interesting. It has a little bit of excitement in it relating to the firefighting, but the characters are what makes this story.<br /><br />And it isn't just the main characters, it is the supporting cast, some of whom I hope to see in a future book by Ms. Nolan. Particularly, the ""staff"" of the fire house. OMG, I can almost write some of their stories in my head. You only get a couple of glimpses of them, but that's enough to see how tight they are and how incredibly well their personalities lent themselves to this story (or their own, hint hint).<br /><br />I'll add something here. I rarely, if ever, feel it necessary to sit up half the night and read a book. I've long since learned that 6AM comes quickly. So what happens? I stay up half the night reading, because this book was just too well written to put down and walk away. So today, I can't see straight but I made some friends within the pages of this book, so all is right with the world.<br /><br />I found this author by accident, and it was the best accident I ever had happen to me.

READ MORE when you don't know what to expect!,"A Bean writing The Living Water took us on a spiritual journey as a master storyteller. This tale became one you want to be true because of the character study she gave us on at least a half dozen of the characters.  So much truth lived out in a mysterious journey that started when the main character was very young.  I love stories when they take time to develop and don't offer solutions in 30 minutes.  Several times I had no idea how the story would end and I was cheering for the entire cast of characters, even the bad guys.<br />I think there is a deep spiritual truth embedded in this story of a young man growing up with his mother. But the story is quite complex which adds to the tension.<br />I gave it 5 stars not because it is the pinnacle of writing excellence but it represents the fulfillment of the author's assignment.

The payment she expected to receive isn't realised but the drugs have brought to the fore vivid nightmares in which she sees herself in an alley with a dead man and bloodied knife.<br /><br />Things escalate rapidly when a few days later there is a news report about a missing man and the image featured is the man from Kelty's dreams.

"Part game show, part guerilla war, all crazy good!","When your new adventure begins with being summoned to the office of a brain parasite that lives in a fish bowl atop a humanoid body, and they want to hammer you for a rule infraction, the only words  you need to know is ""I want a lawyer.""<br />The aliens are in control of this version of Earth, using it as a game show arena for amusement and gambling, and the surviving humans are struggling to make it to the next level.  Most of them won't finish the game.  It's not a game for them, but life and death.<br />You do need to read all the books in order, starting with #1, so that you understand all the nuances.  Otherwise you find yourself with a man in boxers and his talking cat, a pet dinosaur, and a lot of weird associates, and no context to follow what's taking place.  I got on board this book series when I saw the cover art had a cat.<br />Carl got on board when he was at home alone in his apartment with the cat, discovered the cat got out, and went out to look for it.  He found the cat just as the aliens invaded.  Most of Earth's humans died that night...or did they?  They may be in stasis somewhere, awaiting the results of this game.  If the humans win, everything might be restored.  Or it's just another permutation to torment the survivors.<br />There are people from other worlds competing in this game, and aliens from all over the universe are administering, staffing, and doing their best to create an exciting experience for the spectators.<br />If you haven't met Carl and Princess Donut, a Persian cat, yet, get volume one and let 'er rip.  The great part is that you won't have to wait for the next volume to be released...for the first five books.",5.0,1,2022
Hilariously funny book with some problems.,"Throughout most of this book I was laughing all the time, at the dialog, the crackpot characters, the eccentrics.  But it's main failure as a mystery is that the solution requires that the protagonist has significant sources of knowledge, we, the readers, do not have access to, somewhat flattening the ending. That cost one and half stars.<br /><br />The other half star comes off because of the utterly atrocious copy-editing (my late mom was a copy editor).  ""Sunday is sacred"" comes out as ""Sunday is scared.""  A couple moves to the town in 1879 for the wife's health and...""unfortunately she passed away in 1981""--um 1881, right?  Words are omitted, tenses change the past to present and back again.  Doesn't really detract.<br /><br />Still it was a great romp.",3.0,0,2022
"Like a partially cooked soufflé. Not that bad, but not that good either.","This wasn't terrible, but it was very unfinished, incomplete, half-baked.<br /><br />Via flashbacks, we learn that the H was betrothed to his beloved h, but gets trapped by the evil OW as she literally lies in wait for him in bed. The problem? We never meet the evil OW. She dies in childbirth.<br /><br />H jilts the h because his brutally mean father made him so he leaves for the conveniently placed Napoleonic Wars and comes home to a son which is odd as he never had sex with his wife. S<br /><br />It's six years later and he meets up with the heroine and tries to explain why he had to jilt her when his FIL suddenly sends him the son and heir he's ignored for six years. Poor kid. Despite being childhood friends, the H and h go back and forth over whether he had sex with the OW or not. A lot of back and forth. Does she even know him?<br /><br />Too many incomplete threads:<br /><br />Off page evil OW<br />Off page (for the most part) villain<br />Incomplete backstory with dead mother and overly strict father<br />Off page detox from laudanum<br /><br />This was like a partially cooked soufflé, and I don't care for soufflés.

Sparked some great conversations with my sons,"I first read Matched a decade ago and I remembered enjoying it a lot so I decided to read it to my 13- and 15-year-olds for their bedtime story. Once again I enjoyed it very much. We had many great conversations sparked by the chapter or two we read that day. It was very interesting to discover one of my sons would be okay with being matched if it really did guarantee a successful marriage while my other son was totally against the idea. The book is dystopian, but the Society is presented as utopian. As with any utopian-appearing place it is anything but utopia. That inspired a discussion about how some people see the cracks in the perfect facade while others do not or deliberately overlook them and which type of person they’d want to be. The romance part of the book is sweet and very clean (one of my sons, who enjoys a little romance but gets annoyed if there is too much, was very much a fan of the amount in this book). I love the author’s writing style. I just find it very comforting somehow just in the way she phrases things. The use of a poem to push Cassia to act is very clever (and, back when my older daughter read the series at the same time I originally did, it kind of caused her to become a little obsessed with Dylan Thomas and especially with Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night). I’m glad I decided to reread this book and share it with my boys. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys young adult dystopian.",5.0,1,2022
excellent book,"I loved it bc it spoke of Womens empowerment. It’s set back in the 60s but the message is obviously and sadly still relevant today. Great characters make the book. I love the dynamics between all the characters. It shows the authors emotional intelligence and the book is filled with her intellectual intelligence as well.  I had many favorite characters Elizabeth, Mad, and Harriett were the top of the list. And being an avid dog lover with four of my own dogs - I loved six-thirty.

The cats aren't in the book. They go on and on about the cats spending time at grandma's, then nothing. The main event was not even discussed in the end. The fishing competition. Who won?

*Shoddy Marathon Series Constructed With Pilfered Work Of Others*,"“The Earth Epsilon Wars: The Complete Series Books 0-4” is a shoddy construct, only by the pilfering of others’ work by its screenplay writer author.<br /><br />From “War of the Worlds” and through innumerable film and television/cable franchises such as “Terminator,” “Star Trek,” “I Am Legend,” “TheWalking Dead,” “Stargate,” and on and on, the author cherrypicks the work of others, bastardizes it for his own use, and throws it against the wall hoping it will stick.<br /><br />Time travel, zombies, biowarfare, mind control, the list is boringly long. Not an original thought amongst them. Additionally, the protagonists — a father and daughter duo — are true ‘Mary Sues,’ with the author using gimmicky and disingenuous plot devices to make escapes and have success. Add-in a deliberate loss/erasure of continuity to the author’s rancid bag of writing tricks in a hope readers will not note the chicanery. The author’s technically poor writing skill level is a final ‘adding insult to injury’ for a reader.<br /><br />Read fully via Kindle Unlimited, with some notes & highlights on Goodreads.<br /><br />Not recommended.",1.0,0,2022

Tragedy of Being A Celebrity,"Unfortunately, in too many cases it's everybody for themselves.  Three legends of a baby boomer's youth, the men we saw as part of our growing up, failed for one reason or another, to properly look out for themselves. I still fail to understand why Elvis got sucked in by such a shyster.  In some ways, the evil surrounding John Lennon was his own doing.  Still, Yoko Ono destroyed his marriage, his career with The Beatles, and made a pure ass out of him.  With Ali, there was just too much money to be made in boxing.  Surrounding himself with too many greedy people, add in too many greedy wives, and an over generous attitude, and a violent sport like boxing will damage you beyond compare.  O'Reilly and Dugard really dug to find the details for this book, and to define three people in such a short space meant the fat had to be cut away from the facts.  Great read.",5.0,1,2022

Too Politicized,It’s very disappointing when an author you used to love has to start making every book politicized. That’s been Jodi Picoult’s last 3 books for me. We just lived through 2 years of lockdowns and political tensions in our country. Books are supposed to be a getaway. This one was not. It fed into the fake CNN narrative perfectly.

Decent premise gets lost in long boring conversations about consent,"The set up is a guy finds a sentient AI in the body of a hot girl. He rescues her and they go on the run. Great.<br /><br />Then, the hero spends the next 50 pages asking her various questions about how she was made, programmed, trained, etc and pointing out all the ways her autonomy was violated, asking her about what she consented to, how she was traumatized, etc. It feels really pointless and doesn't advance the plot at all.

Is this the same Diana Gabaldon that has written books 1-8?,"First and foremost, I am a big fan of the Outlander Series and author Diana Gabaldon, I have been reading the series since 2005 - I have reread much of this series so many times that I have lost count.  It grieves me to have to say that after waiting 7 years 5 months and 13 days this book was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Giving this novel 3 stars is a gift - the eBook was 955 pages, and 200 pages was worthy of the 3 stars.<br /><br />Go Tell the Bees That I am Gone picks up where Written in My Own Heart’s Blood left off with Brianna, Roger, Jem and Mandy returning to the Ridge.  For Jamie and Claire this is a dream come true to have the whole family reunite. But it is 1779 and the War of Independence rages on slowly creeping into the back country of North Carolina where allegiances on the Ridge are split and with the family back there is even more at stake.<br /><br />Back in Savannah, William Clarence Henry George Ransom, Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, is trying to accept and face up to that fact of his true identity to the point he wants give up his title and land holding in England.  He is also on the hunt for his either deceased or captured Cousin Ben.<br /><br />I love this series because I just love the characters that almost like family to me.  Love Claire, Jamie, Brianna, Roger, Young Ian, LJG, Jenny, Fergus, Marsali and Murtagh when he was alive.  I feel like I have watch the grandkids grow up.  So I was excited to be back on the Ridge - Diana Gabaldon shines when it comes to family life - I love her quite times between Jamie and Claire.  I love the times with Brianna and Roger.  I found the beginning stories with William were dull and boring but oh my there was a turn around with Brianna and William finally meet up .. I think I started liking William.  I just wish we had more time with the 2 of them .. they were delightful together.  There are quite a few minor characters that appear in BEES from previous novel they disappear without an explanation as fast as they appeared.  There lots of new characters Amaranthus, Frances, Agnes, Silvia, Patience, Prudence and The Cunningham - IMHO not overly compelling characters.  But in true Gabaldon fashion some great one liners that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />I adore LJG but there was too much of Hal and LJG - I get why they are part of the story, but they storylines could have been reduced.<br /><br />For me it was obvious with Go Tell the Bees That I am Gone that Diana Gabaldon does not write in a linear fashion - the story was disjointed and choppy.  Almost nothing happens in this book until a good 500 pages have gone by .. I usually don’t hang in that long.  She has often said she write these little vignettes - well I feel like she went thought her files adding these random little vignettes in order to get a BIG BOOK.  I also felt this was a book she had to write in order to position the story for what Diana Gabaldon says will be the last book.  I believe this book suffered from Diana Gabaldon involvement with the TV series, writing episode scripts, making appearances for either the show or her books.<br /><br />My final observation is the vocabulary in the book.  I know authors like to challenge its readers by finding new words to replace the everyday words .. but come on Diana I had to look up well over 100 words .. I know you are smart or did you just get a new thesaurus that you want to put into good use .. this distracts from reading the book.<br /><br />I do plan to listen to BEES as an audiobook - I adore Davina - but I don’t feel compelled to do so very soon.<br /><br />Diana for Book 10 PLEASE get back to all the fun times I had in your previous books .. Claire causing trouble and Jamie saving her, people getting kidnapped .. basically, MORE action.  I need more of the drama, the snappy one lines and humor … and romance.",3.0,0,2022

Character matters more than system.,"I can't imagine trying to play the RPG that is the foundation for this LitRPG.  The system makes little to no sense from the start.  But that isn't a major issue.  The characters are well thought out overall, even if the one sidekick is far more powerful than any character should ever be.  Honestly, that one character was more of a plot force to be used to keep the plot from bogging down on the main characters quirks than he was a genuine relatable and understandable character.<br /><br />But even this all-powerful being is part of a cast that works.  They fit the foundation laid down by the author and the plot gets them to stretch and develop as our lumberjack turned hermit turned into hermit brewer tries to meet the needs of a force he barely understands.<br /><br />I enjoyed this tale.  It keeps the cast small overall, does introduce some challenges that are a bit annoying, but then makes them interesting and fun.  I'm not sure when there will be a sequel, but I am interested in finding out what happens next to our hermit turned brewer and the goddess he works for.",4.0,1,2022
Wonderful End of a Beautiful Trilogy,"One really needs to know that GWENDY'S FINAL TASK is the finale of a trilogy and that one really needs to have read the first two GWENDYs before this one, and also that the first and last are co-written by Stephen King and Richard Chizmar, with the middle one written by Chizmar alone.  All the novels are, at least for Stephen King, very short, almost novella length.  But they are all tasty as the tiny magic chocolates than the magical Button Box dispenses.<br /><br />In the first, GWENDY'S BUTTON BOX, 12 year old Gewndy Peterson meets an odd little man wearing a Bowler hat in the park.  After a rather length palaver, the stranger, Richard Farris (in all of KIng's novels dating back to THE STAND, character's with the initials RF are never simply what they seem), gives Gwendy a little wooden box studded with different color push buttons and 2 levers on the side. One lever dispenses miraculous exquisitely shaped tiny chocolates in the form of some animal, aways different.  The chocolates are the most delicious ever, and have some other interesting properties.  The other lever dispenses an 1891 silver dollar.  The buttons are a different matter, and Farris tells Gwendy how they work and how incredibly dangerous they are. And then Farris is gone.<br /><br />Gewndy makes use of the Button Box a few times in the first two novels, relinquishing the box back to Farris at the end of each.  Here, in GWENDY'S LAST TASK, Gewndy is a US Senator and a past member of of the House of Representatives, and for the first time in over 20 years, Farris reappears with the dreaded Button Box.  He looks very different, older, sicker than the last time and gives the box to Gewndy with a specific set of instructions.<br /><br />Anything else would be a real spoiler, but it should come as no surprise to any Stephen King fans that he frequently refers back to other works in his oeuvre and GWENDY'S FINAL TASK  is no exception, being closely tied to THE DARK TOWER novels, the novella LOW MEN IN YELLOW COATS, and a couple of others.  The plot is great, at 278 pages this is the longest of the Gwendy novels and, I think, the best.<br /><br />I could tell that this isn't solely Stephen King's writing, but just barely.  The ideas, pacing and writing are so similar to pure SK (as was the case with GWENDY's MAGIC FEATHER) that King and Chizmar could probably (and did probably on occasion) finish each other's sentences, while talking or writing.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended.<br /><br />JM Tepper",5.0,1,2022
Strong Start to the Series,"I am so glad I found this book on the “Recommended for you” list on my Kindle app!  It’s a mystery with a touch of potential romance set during Victorian period in New Zealand.  The two main characters, Charlie Pyke and Grace Penrose, are not what I had predicted.  Charlie is a lowly Constable in the police force harassed by his sergeant and has hopes of becoming a true detective.  Grace is the neighborhood medical provider for the poor who hasn’t been able to get into medical school, because she’s a woman.  It didn’t take me long to like these characters.  Grace is called to help a woman injured by a textile loom and dumped in an alley.  The story progresses to a body found behind a brothel.  The mystery has a lot of twist and turns that I did not expect.  Charlie and Grace have a definite chemistry.  Unexpectedly, I learned about the history of New Zealand during the late 1800’s.  It’s obvious the author did her research.<br /><br />As far as the romance: Spoiler Alert: let’s just say I have a feeling the potential romance will be dragged out a bit, which I hope is the case ( many readers may disagree with me).  For me, it keeps me looking forward to the next in the series.  Which I am for this series.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  It’s well written. It is clean (maybe a few curse words).

Fast Paced and Heart Pounding Suspense,"The Jingle Bell Bomber is actively seeking victims to target and the team has to rush from one place to another trying to defuse bombs before they harm people. This is a love story as well an an intriguing suspense tale of bodies piling up and a team of experts stymied about where to go next to stop his vicious attacks. Olive Wells is an analyst and her colleague Zac Turner is an expert at finding and defusing bombs. Zac’s intelligent and intuitive dog Ziva made this book for me! She knew just where to go and when and also knew who needed her gentle presence to calm them. She is a trained bomb sniffing dog as well as a tracker, but she is so much more. Her personality stood out in the book to me and I really enjoyed getting to know her and her people. The characters were all well developed and the pace was fast, with action that was non-stop as the team raced from one place to another, following clues left by the JB, their term for the Jingle Bell Bomber. There are also sub-plots about secrets that Olive and Zac have that eventually have to be revealed for them to try to have a relationship. Faith is also a strong element in the story as the characters who have moved away from God ultimately decide that they need to totally depend on Him to keep them safe and to help them plan a future. The credible characters and their quest to save lives had me mesmerized from beginning to end. I should also note that the weather was almost a character by itself as it kept snowing and interfering with the investigation and the team’s ability to get to places quickly. This was very realistic as the book was set in Canada at Christmas time and added to the emotional turmoil of finding a deadly bomber before he strikes again. Fans of clean romantic suspense will enjoy the story of Zac, Olive and Ziva.<br />Disclaimer<br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author.

Problematic,"I'll start by saying I did not finish the book. I got several chapters in and couldn't bring myself to continue so I will only be reviewing what I did read.. which had issues. I even went and read an alternative version the author had written to see if that was redeeming at all and it was not as well.<br /><br />This book needs a warning that while a fun fantasy, it does not depict safe and sane practice of BDSM and in no way should be used as any sort of guide to starting out or how a Dom or sub should behave.<br />Our FMC has never been a submissive and finds the idea shocking, we go from that to her being physically involved with a Dom on the first night of ""training"" while blindfolded. Establishing trust and safe words, etc. is not done (or shown) at all. On that same first night of ""training"" submissives' limits are being violated even though they are explicitly written out. (As a submissive myself this is horrifying to me, no safe word and taking a brand new submissive and violating a limit 🤮)<br />In this same scene following a bit of body shaming a woman runs out cause her limits were violated and the Dom shames that behavior. There is a whole thing early on in this book about how being submissive is about pleasing the Doms only, which is wrong. BDSM is not abuse but with this book it's easy to see how people look at it that way.<br />No aftercare is given, and instead they are critiqued by a panel of Doms which made me mentally shudder.<br />There is open, obvious and unaddressed racism.<br />We go right into another partner for the FMC who also violates a limit for Brie which goes unaddressed.<br /><br />There is so much wrong with this book and I couldn't finish it and won't be reading anything else by this author.",1.0,0,2022
Beautiful story and dynamic characters,"This novel hooked me from the very first scene! Taryn and Xander are fascinating and multidimensional individuals, and I was cheering them on from the beginning. The allusions to both ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon"" and ""The Snow Queen"" are gorgeous—though this story is completely unique and its own original novel, the symbolism and nods are perfectly placed and so rewarding when a reader spots them! Speaking of gorgeous, the details and scenery in this book are completely immersive. This is one of Ms. Peters' writing strengths: I've found that all her stories are beautifully scenic and magical, and this novel was no exception! It's like being transported into a wintery wonderland with sweeping castles and ancient, sentinel trees! This story is far more action-packed than Ms. Peters' usual lovely stories, and this meant it was practically impossible to put the book down! The relationships are well-developed, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching our heroes overcome each trial and obstacle thrown at them. (I must say, Xander has made his way into my list of alltime favorite fairytale princes!) The book is also well-paced and a complete story: it feels very balanced, and no part felt rushed or too slow. What a powerful journey! This was an incredibly captivating and welcome start to a new series, and I'm ultra excited to read the books that will follow!",5.0,1,2022
Absolutely a fun read!,"The story might be for older children, but as an older person, I found this book to be well written, fast paced and endearing. Bravo!<br />Rose, the 10 year old heroine is believable in a magic world; the emotions are real. As old as I am, (71!) I do remember my reasoning as a child and how hard some of the growing up lessons were. Her family is terrific too, which is absent in so many books now.",5.0,1,2022
Honestly found it boring,"I keep seeing reviews of how strong the FMC is, but I really don’t see it. She’s wishy washy at best, sometimes seeming independent and other times being completely meek. Spoiler: she turns out to be a wargen…and this doesn’t even seem to be a surprise to anyone for some reason. Why isn’t this the first thing addressed after she miraculously shifts the first time??? The guys aren’t that great either, bragging about how advanced their culture is in how they treat women, but going against that every chance they get because they’re more interested in getting her naked than they are getting to know her.<br /><br />Overall, I just found it dragged on. I didn’t like the world it was set in and found all the characters either annoying or boring. It’s a DNF for me.",1.0,0,2022
Surprisingly good!,"I’ve been on a path of irritation with finding a book series in this post apocalyptic genre and have been disappointed 3 times until I read this book. So without further ado, and no spoilers, here’s my .02¢.<br />The author goes on a typical opener for this genre; separated and being found, humanity in chaos, no plans in place, one main character is ex military, etc. I usually speed read through this part retaining about 90% of the story, but Tate added just enough pizzazz and action timed perfectly with the pace of events. It’s not slow or fast paced, but medium paced. I can tell Tate read and reread her story and maybe had some others read and give input. It’s a medium paced beginning with action and a splash of drama.<br />The characters are very well thought out and very relatable. Of course there is a relationship of major convenience, but it doesn’t take away from the story for me, I just shrugged it off and read on.<br />As a science nerd myself, I’d say the damage incurred was a bit underplayed, but if Tate was accurate we’d have no story.<br />The ending was not at all what I was expecting, and to Tate I applaud! It’s hard to surprise me and when I am it’s worth mentioning. So many book series in this genre follow a model or pattern for the first book, Tate did and did not. She had the rough outline but added flair.<br />It’s a great read. It’s a medium paced action read, not fast nor slow. I’d say it’s an easy-level read. I’d rate it M for mature for suggestive actions and there is killing but not descriptive enough for a solid R rating. So if you’re a parent concerned for the innocence of your teen, they’ll be fine.<br />I do plan on reading the second book. Happy reading!",5.0,1,2022
A touching homage to the novels of the late Elizabeth Peters,"Tasha Alexander's Lady Emily mysteries feature a wealthy, aristocratic English peer who partners with a member of the Crown's private security services in investigations and romance.  The plots typically involve archeological elements from Greece and Rome, but, in this book, Lady Emily goes to Egypt.  Along with the murder investigation, she encounters the raven-haired wife of an Egyptologist, her handsome son and his inamorata, and their gifted artist friend, David, characters many devotees will recognize from the books of the late Elizabeth Peters.  The environment described is very faithful to the one that Peters painted for us, and it felt like coming home to an old friend, one we miss very much since Peters passed in 2013.<br /><br />I don't think this is the best of the Lady Emily mysteries... it is a bit stilted and seems forced.  Still, the impulse is very much appreciated and I'm already looking forward to the next installment.",4.0,1,2022
the Arctic is a dangerous place,"This is an incredible story of the Canadian Arctic Expedition, an ill-planned, ill-equipped, and unlucky foray into the Arctic that killed 16 people and left many of the survivors with lifelong injuries.<br /><br />The description is the easiest way to summarize the events leading up to this futile misery.<br /><br />""After a celebratory four-year polar expedition for the American Museum of Natural History that brought him fame, explorer and ethnologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson proposes an even bolder arctic mission. A charismatic, flamboyant impresario, he recruits a team of renowned scientists—including two who accompanied Ernest Shackleton aboard the Nimrod to the South Pole—and secures financing from Canada to journey into the high arctic to investigate the region’s resource potential.<br /><br />Considered the world’s greatest living ice navigator, Captain Bob Bartlett was a veteran of three North Pole excursions with Robert Peary between 1898-1909, making him more than qualified for Stefansson’s Canadian Arctic Expedition. Commissioned to captain the Karluk, a more than thirty-year-old steam brigantine that served as a fishing tender and whaler, Bartlett found a vessel less than sea worthy and ordered a complete refit, putting him at odds with his impatient employer.<br /><br />Once underway in June 1913, it became clear that even with extensive repairs, the Karluk was ill-equipped for Stefansson’s enterprise, as was its crew and scientist passengers. After six weeks of travel, the ship became icebound. Accompanied by five men, Stefansson crossed the floes to hunt caribou, and never returned. Responsible for the twenty-five souls left in his charge, Bartlett endured the sinking of the Karluk and traversed nearly 1000 miles of frozen wilderness to save his marooned shipmates—fighting to survive excruciating, frigid temperatures in makeshift shelters with scarce food sources as months pass with no sign of rescue.""<br /><br />The expedition was accompanied by an Inuit family composed of mother, ""Auntie,"" father, and TWO children!  Auntie saved the expedition by making clothing constantly, trying to make up for the poor planning of Stefansson.  If she hadn't been along, they would have all been doomed.<br /><br />A kitten also made the journey, cuddled by one of the children much of the time.  Spoiler alert: the cat survived and came home to live with one of the surviving crew for the rest of her life.  She actually outlived the man who brought her home, as he was killed on another expedition.<br /><br />The suffering experienced by the members is horrendous.  They had a pack of sled dogs, most of whom fought at every opportunity, caused a lot of work in their care and rescue when they got into trouble, and don't seem to have been that useful in this journey much of the time.  Of course, the expedition never planned on being stranded in an ice pack and the many disasters that followed.  One dog, Molly, did prove to be savior, companion, and a favorite among the travelers.  She saved one man by towing him many miles to a distant camp.<br /><br />One man may have been murdered late in the travails that kept dogging this expedition.  Circumstances, purposeful or coincidental, resulted in the expedition leader leaving the ship relatively early on, making it to shore for a caribou hunt, and never managing to return.  His further contribution - he survived, proceeded to launch ANOTHER expedition and never did much to rescue the shipload of travelers he left in the ice pack.  It seems he wrote them off as lost early on, and expended little effort to confirm this.<br /><br />Another expedition member, Bartlett, took over the ship, and while not all of his choices worked well, helped keep some alive.  Auntie's husband hunted constantly.  Most important of all, Auntie sewed replacement clothing from the hides and skins, repaired damaged items, and kept her children alive.<br /><br />The few Inuit/Inupiat contacts made by expedition members were friendly, with the natives sharing their scant larders with the starving men at their doors.  Even the Chukchi on the Russian side of the strait were hospitable to the strangers they couldn't understand.<br /><br />As an expedition in quest of information, this adventure was largely a dud except as a handbook in what not to do in the future.  One of the scientists fished for oceanic specimens and captured some that he felt were undiscovered.  Regrettably, all of his data was lost when the ship sank.<br /><br />The second from final chapter of this book is the best.  The author followed the subsequent lives of the survivors, who were rescued just in time to participate in WWI.  Some returned to the sea, or continued working for exploratory expeditions.  Strangely, there are some men who do much better in the hardships of the ice lands than at home.<br /><br />Auntie had more children.  Her youngest daughter at the time of the expedition, Mugpi lived to be 97, receiving an award at age 90 for her family's contributions to Arctic science. The Spanish Flu claimed one survivor.<br /><br />Bartlett and Stefansson continued a rivalry, sniping at each other regarding what each had done, or were perceived to have done during this doomed expedition.  Stefansson even wrote a book entitled, ""The Friendly Arctic,"" espousing that the  land provided an adequate living for the prepared traveler, contrary to what was experienced by Bartlett and his group.  This chapter is a relief after pages of frostbite, gangrene, illness and starvation.  While ""happily ever after"" wasn't the case for all, some continued to seek adventurous lives.",4.0,1,2022
Overly complex rehash of LitRPG tropes,"There were so many moments that made me want to love this book.  The ideas behind the story were solid, and while as is so common with LitRPG the game system was overly complex and not really given a good foundation, it was still fun to read about.<br /><br />Of course many of my regular complaints about the genre played out.  The game system and the long descriptions of the events dragged down the character development.  And there was a huge lack of character depth.  There were times that the hero seemed more interested in the game system than in any of the other beings he's around, and that limited my ability to get into the tale.  I like reading about characters, not about a bunch of powers and abilities that may or may not really matter.<br /><br />Add in the usual problem villains that tend to drive my out of my immersion and I have to say that this is a decent tale but just lacking a bit.  Call it a solid 3 star.",3.0,0,2022

An Excellent Look at Andy's All-Too Short Life,"Oh, Andy. He left us far too soon.  Who knows how many more #1 songs he would have had had he not passed away 30+ years ago. If he were still alive, I think he'd make an excellent judge on reality talent- competition shows that currently air. Anyway...this an excellent biography that covers  Andy's all -too short life.  From growing up as the baby in the Gibb family, throughout childhood/teen years,  up until his death at the too young age of 30, this book covers it all. Its almost hard to fathom someone who was so talented, VERY well liked and gorgeous could have such low self -esteem.  And demons...oh, the demons. Drug/alcohol addiction, a desire to be the best, wanting (desperately, at times) to be a member of the Bee Gees, losing the love of his life, Victoria Principal, a failed marriage, not having a relationship with his young daughter... ALL of this is addressed in the book.  I must tell you, there will be moments in this book that might make you quite sad.  I sure was. But its also nice to read about Andy's incredible talent and especially what an incredibly kind, well-liked man he was.<br /><br />The book was a fast read for me. I enjoyed every page of it.",5.0,1,2022
"Kick the main character in the stones, Stat!","There is no romance in this tale.  Let's start out by quashing that idea.  This story could have been romantic, but the main character has no romance in his soul.  He looks at Eve and does think she's ""cute"" or occasionally ""dangerous"", but the idea of building a lasting relationship built on something other than her powers or her willingness to have sex never seems to enter the tale.  Honestly Eve is surprisingly two dimensional in her personality.  She's cute, perky, happy and will do ANYTHING to please TC.<br /><br />There probably is some secret reason that TC is such a pill when it comes to his interactions with Eve, but those are never shown.  instead we get multiple mental soliloquies where its clear he doesn't want to go all the way with Eve, but no reason why.<br /><br />The plot itself is rather good, which kept me from completely condemning the problems with the characters.  This is a story that i had some trouble pressing through to the finish, but it was worth the effort.  The book is a solid 3 star.",3.0,0,2022

Don’t save your DREAMS; Dreams melt like ice cream.,"Author, coach, entrepreneur, and leader, Richie Norton, has given readers a gift in his Anti-Time Management: Reclaim Your Time and Revolutionize Your Results with the Power of Time Tipping. He shares the powerful message of how to live your dreams today.<br /><br />Do you know what is most important to you? Then live that, or the essence of that, NOW. As an example, Richie shares how he and his wife decided early on that spending time with the family and traveling were critical. They lived simply, found roles and opportunities to “work from anywhere,” and got out on the road. Yes, he and his family have a lovely home now. And they still travel and have freedom of choice. In a recent conversation, one son was in Africa and another in the mountains. They  built success and resources over time, while living and working in ways that reflected what was important.<br /><br />In contrast—and the reason he wrote Anti-Time Management—is the system where people are told to work hard for 40-60 years, then retire and pursue dreams. By then, have relationships survived? Has health or vitality deteriorated? Are resources available? Are the dreams even attainable anymore?<br /><br />Richie isn’t selling a “get rich quick” scheme. He’s offering a thoughtful process for considering what is most meaningful in relationships, life, and pursuits. He advocates concepts like time tipping, project stacking, work syncing, and expert sourcing, and goals as means and not ends.<br /><br />Anti-Time Management is chock full of examples of people who have also made the process work for them and their families at a range of career phases and income brackets. Richie describes the what-why-how to begin applying the principles in your own life. And yes, some choices require trade-offs. He’s pretty frank, if you want to travel but you don’t have the financial means, then sell something. Do you need designer furnishings, or will items sourced from Craigslist do? Every choice offers a reflection of what we’re deciding is important. Richie prioritized values into his life from the beginning. You can, too.<br /><br />As a coach and mentor, I help countless people reinvent, redesign, and pivot in life and work. Anti-Time Management invites individuals and leaders to ask themselves what they really want, and offers a message for valuing time not timing values. If you’re ready to make a change, this book is a worthy read.",5.0,1,2022

"Story slays, dawg! But, not pulling trigger on Book 2…","The characters & their various unique personalities are what truly make this story shine!<br />This author really knows his stuff when it comes to character creation, development, dialogue, & the portrayal of inner thoughts.<br />Additionally, EE Isherwood offers excellent emotional language writing skills, & his characters display fantastic levels of nonverbal communication- which is a feat in non visual arts!<br />Every interaction feels easy & natural. Like I could walk right out my front door today, onto the Clownfish cul-de-sac & bump into any one of these very realistic neighbors Isherwood has so masterfully crafted.<br />The story itself Neighborhood Watch, the 1st book in the After the EMP series, is not really groundbreaking nor anything I haven’t read before a few times.<br />There are a few scenes & scenarios which are a bit different, of course. These involve, most especially, interactions between the neighbors themselves.<br />The oldest couple, to date, I find extremely amusing. And the “bad boy,” rich kid on the block, his related storyline is fun to read as well. (The “dawg, etc.,” in my subject line is pulled straight from his vocabulary, fyi. ;)<br />This story is written in a very “tame” style.<br />At least Book 1 is.<br />Wherein there is no swearing. There is really no violence to speak of. Other than *the absolute minimum* firearms or weapons use (pistol & rifle in this case). And when there are scenes, the gunfight is quick & with minimal details. Including the least amount of injury as possible (& again here, very glossed over on the details of injuries).<br />This is a story about relationships during an apocalyptic situation more than anything. How a small community comes together; works the kinks out, begins to function as a team. Down the line I can see themselves considering one another “Family.”<br />At least thus far, the After the EMP series is not for the hard hitter types. Who enjoy the true gritty realism, including how people honestly speak.<br />So! For me, I enjoyed reading Book 1 of this series, & getting a little peek into the start of all these lovely people’s lives. But this is where I hop off the ride with thanks to the author.<br />And I do also suggest all apocalypse genre fans give this story a try. Even if the “tamer” books aren’t usually your cup’o’tea.<br />There is so much to like here. And the #1 main character, Frank- well, he himself has been around the block, understands weapons, & is a true guy’s guy. Even if his harder edges have been sanded a bit for purposes of this story.<br />You never know. There’s a lot of possibilities to get hooked here. Give it at least Book 1 & see. Yk?<br />For me … I’m off to find my next swear & bloody gunfight saturated story, chock full of slavers & cannibals!

Perhaps it's the Irish...? Or is it just Himself?  Or both?,"This is the most interesting autobiography I've read. More a stream of consciousness full of memories as they come to mind while living in the present, with small worry for the future. Interspersed throughout by both past voices and personal self-talk. Overall I found it fascinating and difficult to put down. The craggy face of the author, never giving a hint of the true thoughts of the quiet, shy boy within, but always compelling me to look, stare, watch, read on. Perhaps the soul of the Irish storyteller? I don't know but I will not soon forget his story here. I want now to visit more of his movies to look for this true person, even though those aren't the real him. My only wish for the book would be for a few photographs of family and younger days, however, his descriptions were perhaps vivid enough to see them in my mind's eye which made it okay. Thank you Gabriel Byrne for sharing such raw truths, some sad, some thoughtful, but all remarkably beautiful. When all is said and done, perhaps that's what all our lives are about?  From one shy introvert to others who will read and understand, I highly recommend this book.  👉❤👈<br /><br />UPDATE - ""Pictures in my Head"" by Gabriel Byrne (1995) has many of the photos I missed in his latest book (above review).  He is also one of the six yummy gents interviewed in ""Hollywood Irish in their own words"" (1997) with additional photos. The latter book was also edited by his friend Aine O'Connor.

"A Holiday Romance For Fans of Emily Henry's ""People We Meet On Vacation""","I loved this book beginning to end.<br /><br />Each character is fully realized (always hard to come by in holiday romances, it seems!), and Molly and Andrew's back stories and how they intertwine over time is incredibly sweet. The two of them are interesting people on their own, so you feel immediately invested in the will they/won't they trip they end up taking around the world.<br /><br />The vibe here is akin to Emily Henry's People We Meet On Vacation- I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop reading. I am usually not a huge friends-to-lovers fan, but this is really spectacularly done. I will definitely be rereading this!<br /><br />Two important notes:<br />First, the spice is a 1/5 for quality. I am a spice connoisseur  at this point and I just wish this hadn't been there. It was fine, I guess, but I had infinitely higher hopes for their chemistry than what we get here. Read it or skip it, you're not missing anything either way.<br /><br />Second, if you're an audiobook reader, the narrator for Molly is just not quite right. There's absolutely nothing wrong with her, she's lovely and has a pleasant voice, but she just doesn't quite match Molly's personality. I definitely recommend pairing your audiobook with an ebook or paperback, or just reading the ebook/paperback version.",4.0,1,2022

Subpar,"If I weren’t a decades long fan of this series and author I’d probably rate it lower. This particular book is all over the place and so disjointed at times that it’s a slog to read and sometimes just plain boring. Not what I expected from DG who normally writes such beautiful, engaging, tightly woven books. This is not her usual excellence.<br /><br />It’s also impossible to read and fully understand this book in the series if you haven’t purchased and read all the “side” books she wrote before this one (which apparently stalled her finishing this one?).<br /><br />While I personally think it’s genius to make a crapton more money by doing it this way, and I have mad respect for that, it does diminish the experience for those who want to read the Outlander series but are not interested in sidetracking to read and re-reading all the spin-off stories about LJG and other minor characters. This is the first book in the Outlander series that assumes the reader has read all the “bulges” she writes, and it’s a bit irritating. I like LJG, but he’s not the reason I’ve been reading Outlander for two decades, and he and his entire extended family are now central to the story rather than Jamie and Claire and clan Fraser. Obviously William needs to be part of Jamie’s story, but it feels more contrived and tedious than it needs to be. And William’s story development has been so tediously drawn out already in the series, and he’s just pathetic and whiny and dreadfully boring. More William = Zzzzz.<br /><br />So, if you re-read books 1-8 to prepare to read this long awaited book 9, it won’t be enough to get you caught up. Now you need to buy and read every scrap she writes because she’s weaving those bulges into the main narrative now, so it won’t make full sense otherwise, and then you’ll have to wade through one of the toxic internet groups full of her nutty obnoxious fanatical worshippers to find the answers. (I think DG is smart, chill and funny, but her famatics are just u-g-l-y).<br /><br />I never thought I would say this, but it’s clearly time for this series to end. It’s just not engaging, interesting, or exciting anymore, and frankly it seems like DG has run out of passion for it, too. But she’d be crazy to kill such an enormous cash cow and not milk it for the money as long as she can. Absolutely no shame there, imo, but it’s sad to watch the awesome Outlander series deteriorate into mediocrity like this.",3.0,0,2022
Fast-paced,"EXILES is a fast-paced science fiction thriller. When I started it last night, I was sucked right in and read to the halfway point. The book takes place after an earthquake splintered Los Angeles, leaving millions homeless and hopeless. Wealth and technology insulate a certain few, and one of those wealthy men created a utopia. He fosters and educates a handful of orphans every year, which is where Crys and Jade come in.<br /><br />The twins are estranged, Crys staying in the gilded world of Adsum Academy while Jade fled and became one of the Exiled. I liked that the twins were written by actual twin sisters, I feel that gave extra depth to their fractured relationship. I also liked the glimpses of Adsum Academy; the tech wasn’t super far off from what’s available now, so you get the sense many of the events could happen in the near future.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn’t like the second half of the book as much. The book is so fast-paced that I didn’t have any connection to any of the characters, nor did I always understand what was going on. The science isn’t very complicated, but sometimes I felt like I’d missed a vital clue or plot event.<br /><br />Around the 80% point, I guessed the book was headed towards setting up a sequel and yup, I was right. I’ll check out the sequel if I remember.",3.0,0,2022
"Solid Space Opera Action, But Not Really  a Novel…","Glynn Stewart’s book, “Conviction,” is confidently written, but is unsurprising for its thin characterisations and purely action driven plot. I suppose this is something of a tradition in science-fiction, but if this is true, it's nonetheless disappointing.<br /><br />In the 1980s and 90s, authors like Butler, Le Guin and Delaney were moving science-fiction in new directions. Action was still of central importance, but character was gaining a far stronger role. In “Conviction” the questions of agency, judgement and self examination barely enter in. The characters rush about endlessly, breathlessly entering combat and other risky situations  with hardly a moment’s notice or the space to examine why and for what reasons they are about to take life, and risk their own lives.<br /><br />Indeed, for the principals, the need for planning is entirely subordinated to “good instincts,” and repeated drills. Self examination is equated with self-doubt and weakness. We are repeatedly told, by way of example, that the protagonist lives under the threat of a million credit “contract” against her life. This bounty, offered by a powerful foreign government seems hardly to have an impact on the Commander’s life or thought. Even having to accept the need for bodyguards gives the Commander little pause, and they quickly disappear from the novel’s foreground.<br /><br />The author’s descriptive powers are also lacking, leaving us without a stage on which action occurs. This fact might explain other reviewers complaints regarding the author’s poor “world building.” The only space really described in any detail is the bridge of the hauler converted to naval carrier, a space that the protagonist visits only briefly.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say, this ""book” is not a complete novel, but yet another bastardisation of the form in service to Amazon”s submission policies for its Kindle Unlimited program. I like action and the space opera genre, but not at the expense of character, and reasonable consequences to the decisions a character takes.<br /><br />There’s little here to calling me to continue reading. I find nothing in the reviews of the authors later “novels” to suggest that they have improved over this first volume. What works for a film serial does not prove useful in a novel. The books cliffhanger ending is simply an annoyance. It’s also enough to give me pause about downloading other books in the series.<br /><br /> I think then that this is my first and last Stewart “novel.”",3.0,0,2022
Suspicions confirmed,"First, the book is best enjoyed after deep-diving into English history. It is not the place to begin the study of English history.<br /><br />Following the money works for me. Coins were last minted in 383, Roman London. Then nothing was minted again until 650, when 30 mints and 30 kings stamped coins of unknown tribal and ethnic significance imitating continental Merovingians. Until 880 and the founding of the royal mint by Alfred the Great, there had been no uniform currency in 500 years. Archaeology is all that remains of Dark Age citizens/residents, and even this evidence is minimal by historical comparison to any other period in even most ancient history.<br /><br />From the evidence, Roman Brits lived in heated houses with plumbing. Then, they lived in round huts, having forgotten the chimney and plumbing. They would evolve to live in both round and square huts like the continent, with floors below ground. 536 would be the worst year in recorded history with plague, global famine, and mini-ice age. In Britain, the year past unnoted by the few writing.<br /><br />The ‘First Kingdom’ is a long book about little to no history. The author is almost apologetic for writing a book about virtually nothing, and he goes to great lengths to prove it. The evidence seems to refute the brooding, mean history we’ve been merchandised to believe. Unwalled cities and peaceably dead are pretty good evidence.<br /><br />Quite helpful in positioning the pieces of evidence despite folklore.",5.0,1,2022

Welcome to Season 2,"This is book 1 of season two of the ""Trackers"" universe. It's set roughly two years out from the precipitating post-apocalyptic event. There are a few characters from season one. For those two reasons, I highly recommend reading the books from season 1, first, if you haven't already done so.<br /><br />Sam Spears known as ""Raven"" served in the US Marine Corps and is now a paid tracker. Primarily he and his canine partner, Creek, look for missing family members. However, in this story, Raven and Creek are called upon to protect a supply train from raiders as they cross into what is known by some as the Badlands. In an apocalyptic world, anything can happen to limit the chances of a successful arrival. While Raven, Creek, and the other scouts do their best to even the odds, the raiders are up to dirty tricks. Will the supply train arrive at its destination or will everything go sideways?<br /><br />I applaud the author duo for creating a well-paced, exciting story that kept me guessing at the outcome.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was part of a select group to read a pre-published copy of this work.

There are several wonderful main characters and I enjoyed all the interwoven tales.<br /><br />Again as with my first story from this author, I am just amazed that this depth of character development and love and understanding for human flaws and forgiveness was written by a man!

Romantically Dull,"I am reviewing this as a romance as this is the category I purchased it under. I loved the story, but it was pretty dull when it came to the romance. I never felt the female or male protagonist (Evelyn and Ahmed) connected on a romantic level. Ahmed was a great hero and Evelyn a fabulous heroine but together they were dull. I couldn’t understand why they fell in love. I kept making sure my kindle/audiobook didn’t skip a pivotal scene. I was more excited by the two other young gentleman slated to be the future heroes in the next books, both of which only had a few lines; but they sparkled more when engaging Ann and Julia. Geez I wish the author would have crafted the romance as well as she crafted the spiritualism of the time, or even the horseback riding.<br />If this had been written and sold as woman fiction, I would have given it a higher star rating.",2.0,0,2022

Instead of sympathizing with her, I wanted to shake her repeatedly.

Who is the target audience for this book,"I gave this book 2 stars, giving it the benefit of the doubt since I may not be the target audience for the book.  The writing felt as though it was speaking to a child, yet much of the grammar was more mature.  (I was going to provide examples, but can not muster up enough interest to go back and look some up.)  I cannot figure out the target audience because after 8 years working in a middle school library, I feel the writing would be insulting to the 12-14 year-old audience.  I've read and enjoyed many books geared to young adults, even after I no longer worked in the library.  I just enjoyed the work of many of the young adult fiction, such as Sarah Dessen, Stephanie Meyer and Rick Riordan. This book also does not work for elementary school kids as they may need a dictionary to understand some of the words chosen.<br />To equate ""The Twelve Topsy-Turvy, Very Messy Days of Christmas"" with a classic such as the Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" is insulting to Dickens' work.<br />I could not read the entire, implausible book.  At about 20 percent read I could not continue, so I started jumping forward and reading a chapter here and there and finally read the final 3 chapters.  I don't feel that I missed anything in the story and was glad to finish it early.",2.0,0,2022

Suspense Mystery At Its Best,"I re-read this book that I read many years ago in order to be ready to read the sequel coming soon, entitled “Where Are The Children Now?” Since I read the original book when it was first released, I found that reading it this time was like reading a new-to-me book since I did not recall hardly any of the plot twists. I did recall the characters, especially Nancy. I was captured by her spirit and fortitude which were very realistic and heartbreaking at times. The entire book was written in a way that kept me engaged and hoping that the villain was caught in the end. I was able to guess who the kidnapper was due to good clues that were provided and I was delighted at the end to find out that I guessed correctly. No one writes a good suspense mystery like Mary Higgins Clark and I was as fascinated by this book during the second reading as I was the first time I read it.<br />I purchased a copy of this book and was not required to write a positive review.

Linda Wallander is not a likable protagonist,"About a month ago, I decided to read the whole Wallander series straight through, but since this one is the first Linda Wallander book (though it doesn't appear there were any more after it), I wasn't sure where it fit in. Also, when I finished Firewall, the epilogue led me to believe this was the last book in the Kurt Wallander series, but somehow there are three more on Amazon. Based on the first few pages of those three, this looked like the next one in sequence.<br /><br />In terms of timeline, this picks up right where Firewall left off. Linda has just finished the police academy and is waiting to start her new job as a patrol officer in Ystad when one of her friends disappears. From there, a whole series of somewhat ridiculous/coincidental things happens, including several people disappearing/reappearing, a Jim Jones survivor gathering his own cult members right in Wallander's backyard, Linda breaking into various residences and ""borrowing"" her friend's car pretty much whenever she feels like it, Linda going over to Copenhagen to check out a lead by herself in a sketchy neighborhood after dark, and - my favorite - Linda possessing the intuition of an experienced investigator.<br /><br />I just didn't like the character of Linda. Though she gave us more insight into the relationship between her parents and added some dimension to her father's personality, she wasn't a protagonist I felt like rooting for. At this point, if you've read any other books in the series, you know that Wallander sometimes does things he knows he shouldn't and usually has an internal battle about the ethics of it, but Linda doesn't seem to have any qualms about doing things that are wrong. And while Linda and Kurt have a similarly contentious relationship as Kurt had with his own father, the way she behaved at times was over-the-top disrespectful (like throwing an ashtray at his face at work).<br /><br />This book gets three stars because I really like Mankell's writing style. I'm on to An Event in Autumn, which I'm pretty sure is the next book in the series, and I'm happy to see Linda return to being a background character.",3.0,0,2022
Highly Entertaining Sci Fi by Dean Koontz,"It's been a while since I read a science fiction book, and boy, was it fun! In ""Quicksilver,"" by Dean Koontz, the titular character, whose first name is Quinn, is a boy who was abandoned as an infant and raised in an orphanage.  While working his first job as a writer, he starts to experience strange urges, almost like callings, which lead him to unfamiliar destinations. When he answers the callings, he meets like-minded people who help him pursue answers to his origins and unusual sensations.<br /><br />Dean Koontz conjured up a slew of friendly and evil aliens (all of whom appear in human form) to battle for the fate of the world.  The good guys pick up some help from mere mortals to form a powerful team which embarks on a quest to ferret out the bad guys and destroy them, one at a time, if necessary. Complicating the efforts of Quinn and his pals,  an elite government security team is tracking their every move, trying to capture them or worse.<br /><br />I would recommend this (with one reservation to follow) as a high interest book for young adult readers, especially since the heroes consist of young people and a dog, aided by an affable grandfather. The book blends references to pop culture with classical ones, and it could serve as a nice vocabulary builder. There is only a smattering of crass language, and boyfriends and girlfriends are strictly platonic. My only hesitation is that the evil forces are heavily involved in sex trafficking in the final portion of the book.  Though the scenes are not extremely graphic, it is clear that young people have been abducted and forced into sexual slavery.<br /><br />Koontz's creative, clever, and even humorous narrative made this senior citizen enjoy the book greatly.",4.0,1,2022

"A great thriller, with twists at every turn!","This book would have had 5 stars easily, but the grammatical errors and character and place names kept tripping me up. The grammatical errors made me have to reread several sentences to understand what she was trying to say, which was very annoying. It also threw off the flow of the storyline. I don't blame the author for this; that's what editors are supposed to catch. What made me really take note ( LITERALLY pulled up a note pad from my phone and started listing all the names) were how many character names were extremely similar to real people.  For example, Kelli Underwood (Carrie Underwood-American Idol) , Pamela Nelson (Pamela Anderson-Baywatch), Rakers Penitentiary (Rikers Island), and so many more (hence the phone memo pad). I'm sure with so many books out, it must be difficult to come up with new names that haven't been used in previous books; hence 4 stars. Despite these frequent bumps in the literary road, I loved this book. The constant twists in the storyline, had me covering up the right side of my screen, to prevent myself from skipping ahead (I still did a few times). Every time I was positive I knew who the real killer was, a new twist was introduced, making me start guessing all over again. Mrs. McFadden is definitely the Queen of the psychological thriller!

Kindle Edition Review,"This is a lovely cake book, I’m so glad I was able to swoop in and grab the kindle edition while it was on sale for $2.99.<br /><br />Each recipe has a beautiful photo,( which is always appreciated) and there are plenty of cake varieties to choose from in this book.<br /><br />I’m also over the moon that the author chose to offer metric (weighed) ingredient lists in the book, as opposed to only offering less accurate volume measurements. I’m glad to see that other American baking book releases are also doing this. Let’s hope this is a trend that points to a future where metric is common place for baking books in the USA 🇺🇸 😀.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book if you love to bake, and collect cookbooks like I do.

I highlighted sooooo much lol.<br />-JP H… he’s jealous of guys who are interested in Gabbie and I love those little moments bc he can’t react since these people know him as her brother.<br />-No cheating or sharing or OM/OW drama.. there’s little scenes or a guy from her school asking her out while H is right there but she turns him down and never leads anyone on. A old F-buddy shows up at H place while him and gabby are there and he sees her straight. They are both all in.<br />-it’s like… their soul mates. They have always loved each other so deeply and had a special bond and that once innocent bond grew into something else and they both knew that they were never going back.

Did they move to start over somewhere else? But it just went to the epilogue lol.<br /><br />This book was really good. I really enjoyed James and gabby’s love story.

Who Doesn't Like a Cinderella Story?,"This novel is a more modern day Cinderella story romance. A poor single mother hotel maid, treated badly by her employer and the town (not by ugly stepsisters). She meets her prince (super nice wealthy guy) who immediately falls madly in love. I can't say that never happens as it happened to me and my husband--decades ago. I saw comments about the big boobs being childish. I hate that people say that. It is honestly a big problem for women who are well endowed and bloom early in life and end up big. I thought it was a nice thing to see it treated nicely in a novel. So far as a review talking about the comments on graphic sex scenes, I didn't see any. I did read every page. So maybe some readers don't like to read about sex? And another comment was made about describing Mac as ""huge"". Well most women tend to think their man is huge when the are first in love and lucky ones years later. Either way, bigger than normal or just normal, it doesn't matter to the story. He loves her and her son. He's a really good man, not some dark, alpha, predatory man. (No problem, I like those stories, too). It was a nice change to not have that. At least there were no vicious, scheming exes trying to derail the romance or serial killers or abusive ex-husbands/boyfriends. And it was refreshing to see a mother who had ""plans"" for her son actually back off and support him after he told her to.  Wait! He stood up to his mother? That doesn't often happen in such stories. She won't be the evil, hateful mother-in-law either, thank you author. I look forward to more of this series.",5.0,1,2022

A poor book written by an author that has potential but refuses to try for that potential.,"A book that in my opinion always took the easiest way through the plot proposed. There was no to very little character development. Whenever Delancey got to a point in the book that could have been really good she reverted to whining by the Hero about no one ever giving him a chance to prove himself when all he did was do everything he could to sabotage himself. Success wasn’t Will’s primary motivation because sex seemed to be always first. Lucy at least was portrayed partly responsible for her actions, although the actions were always questionable decisions. And she was being portrayed as a kicka—<br />building contractor. I can’t understand why she did the actions she did. But considering she was a woman competing in a “mans” world, her action slip-ups were dangerous for her business and her business reputation.<br />And sadly this was never addressed.<br />Like I stated earlier there was very little to no character development.<br />I did almost make it to 60% of the book before I decided not to waste anymore time.<br />I read book 1 and although very short I did see the same shortcomings of that book that I see in this one.<br />Maybe Delancey Stewart could be a good author if she works at it, however I can’t see any real effort being exerted.<br />However any reader should try her work and decide for themselves what they like/dislike from her efforts!<br />However do realize that she has been writing books for almost 10 years with evidently very little growth.<br />I’m not an author so please excuse my put downs of her work. In her opinion I’m sure she is doing the best she can.",1.0,0,2022

Disappointed,"Started reading this book and thought it was going to be a 'good read' as the provider suggests. But even though the story itself seemed like it would be interesting, I had to stop reading it because of the language and over explained sex scenes. I realize in today's world the 'f' word is used like the words ""pass the salt and pepper"", but after awhile you get tired of reading it even when it comes from a pretty crass character. I got the point early on, he's a gruff guy, even though he does some good things. Same for the sex scene explanations...overdone. So if that's what you like to read, this book is for you. I've read some books before that included steamy relationships but they were tastefully done leaving the amount of 'steam' to the readers imagination. As far as the story, I'm sure the young girl at the center of concern, turns out fine despite the flawed characters around her.",1.0,0,2022
Would like to have been able to connect more on an emotional level,"I'll preface this review by saying that I come from a very similar immigration background as the author - same race, parents from the same country, similar overall trajectory/journey/circumstances. It is the reason I ordered the book as soon as it came out, actually; someone else was now telling the story I had been too afraid to tell my whole life. In fact, a *number* of incidents in the book were eerily similar to ones that I had experienced, from salivating over my first library card to being called out by an English teacher about my writing to my wanting a cat to the gaslighting comment that the author's parents made one night (and probably on more than one night).<br /><br />While I could relate to a number of external experiences, I found that I did not really connect with the author on an emotional level. Maybe it is because the story is told from a child's perspective, but the author doesn't seem to go too far beyond the pain of hunger, poverty, fear, and alienation/discrimination...NOT that that isn't a lot! But having gone through a similar childhood, I can say that even as a child the emotions and the fears and the thoughts can be more nuanced...I think the book spends a lot of time conveying the external difficulties and awfulness - the lack of food, the impoverished living and work conditions - and not as much on the internal thought processes. For example, I remember feeling the unnerving goal of preparing for a future I didn't know if I would have - how do you put your all into studying hard, aiming for college, and dreaming about a future when you don't even know if you will be deported the next day? How do you relax and enjoy the here and now (a trip to MacDonald's, a day in the park, a play date with a friend) when you don't know when the rug will be ripped out from under you? How do you deal with the feeling of being trapped - of keeping a low profile in public and having only your toxic (because of trauma) family unit to lean on? I was also surprised that the author did not feel any resentment or discomfort at all having to often be the ""parent"" to her mother.<br /><br />I think it was also probably a little awkward for the story to be told from the perspective of a child, because it sounded like a child in a way, but not really. I read this book right after having read Room by Emma Donoghue, which is narrated by a 5 year old boy. In Room the narrator *sounds* like a child and I felt I was really seeing his life through his eyes. Beautiful Country felt a bit more like telling than showing, and like an adult trying to sound like a child. My guess, too, is that the negative tone and perspective came from that child's perspective - she didn't have a choice in moving, and many children have a hard time adapting - but like other reviewers remarked, she and the family did seem really really unhappy in America. The acknowledgement at the end actually sounds like a different person - there the author is warm and gracious and grateful. I don't want to dismiss her childhood feelings about the US - it is not for me to judge someone else's feelings and experiences - but I bring this point up because there seems to be a disconnect between her story and the acknowledgement, and this goes back to the story perhaps not being nuanced enough.  I'm sure there is a reason that the author moved back to the US for college and has since made her home here but that part is not clear.<br /><br />One piece of the story that I would have liked to read more about is the father's apparent mental illness, or his seeming decline into mental illness. He figures in the book but she doesn't say too much about it. And not to say that I expect her experience to be my experience, but I became a keen observer of my parents' psychology growing up - they had a larger-than-life presence and influence in our cloistered lives and small home - and I guess I was expecting more of that in this book as well.<br /><br />I did start to feel more emotionally as the story was winding down, and especially as I read her acknowledgement. I don't know if it was because she was getting older in the story and so was able to write more, now that she was no longer 7 or 8 years old.  I can see how this would be an eye-opening read for someone who is unfamiliar with the lives of poor immigrants and/or people of color...as someone for whom these life circumstances are not new, however, this memoir in the manner in which it is told had less of an impact on me.",3.0,0,2022

5 stars,"I liked How Not to Drown in a Glass of Water so much I finished it in less than 24 hours (I had to go to sleep but finished the last 11 minutes immediately upon waking). The audio felt like I was sitting in the interview room with Cara while still able to be transported to the apartment building or other places her life story took us. Her application answers were hilarious!<br /><br />There was a time midway through the book that I was not Cara's biggest fan. Her old-school way of parenting and viewing the parent-child dynamic in this day and age (2007-2009, but still) and dismissal of therapy as a way to understand oneself and grow to be a better person was frustrating. I had to remind myself that she is perfectly imperfect, as we all are, and made mistakes. Who am I to judge? But also, the fact that Angie Cruz had me feeling strong emotions at all automatically increased my rating from 4 stars to 5. It shows that I care and am invested.<br /><br />Rossmery Almontewas a joy to listen to as Cara. My only complaint is Kimberly M. Wetherell wasn't a part of the interview. It would have been more enjoyable if it was a back and forth between them, even briefly, instead of Cara ""repeating"" what was said to show dialogue.<br /><br />Thank you to Macmillan Audio for providing me with an ALC.",5.0,1,2022
Getting knocked down in life is a given. Getting up and moving forward is a choice. ~ Zig Ziglar,"As the story begins, Elizabeth has already had a knock-down experience.  She refused a proposal at Hunsford and accepts a letter detailing, for her, her lack of understanding of characters, specifically the characters of Fitzwilliam Darcy and George Wickham. She sees that her sister, Jane, had judged these two men more kindly and more correctly.  Elizabeth makes a vow: to behave more like Jane.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet accepts an offer of an excursion, channeling her inner Jane, and gets knocked down again — repeatedly.<br /><br />I am not going to recount much of this story. I will just say that it grabbed me this morning and would not let me go back to bed until I had finished it. Only one issue for me: the villain’s fate is left a bit up in the air.<br /><br />But look at what we have — danger, travel, hiding in plain sight, and coincidences galore.<br /><br />I loved it!<br /><br />Many times the wrong train took me to the right place. ~ Paul Coelho",5.0,1,2022

Do research beyond Google after reading this book.,"My wife, who is a physician, is mostly through reading this book.  It is well researched and solidly written. She will most likely go to the Amen Clinic for her problems.<br /><br />Another physician, whom we know that is double board certified and the director of a medical clinic, is taking her son to the Amen Clinic.<br /><br />A nurse friend, who researches everything, took her daughter there.<br /><br />I am assisting my wife in research and reviewing journal articles around the world.  What I have found is that other countries are using SPECT to assist in diagnosis.  Japan, Taiwan, India and Singapore are all researching this and publishing positive results in peer reviewed journals.  So it comes down to whom do you trust: top Amazon reviewers that parrot Google searches of the APA (a valid professional source, though funded by mostly pharmaceutical companies and are a manifestation of resisting behaviors of described by behavioral psychologist Thomas Kuhn). Or do you believe the medical professionals who have access to and read journal articles (but all may not be doing so) and are taking their family members to the Amen Clinic.<br /><br />It's a lot of money that is mostly not covered by insurance.  There is no clear cut answer, because it is relatively new and cutting across the grain of traditional medicine.

Historical Fiction Way Too Heavy on the Fiction,"Above the Bay of Angels is historical fiction that is very heavy on the fiction. It starts with the author imagining that Queen Victoria employed female cooks at Buckingham Palace and moves on to the death of a completely made up royal apparently due to accidental poisoning via a mushroom in a pie. The inspector decides the cook intended that mushroom for the Queen which makes absolutely no sense. She made the pie for the whole royal party so there would be no way to control who got the one poisonous mushroom. In addition to all of that, the cook was around to hear pretty much everything that was going on and did things like console a distressed royal, visit regularly and informally with the Queen, and singlehandedly solve the mystery of who poisoned the Count and why. If you can ignore the incredible implausibility of the story and get past the fact it moves super slowly and little happens for the first three-quarters, it’s an enjoyable book. I just much prefer my historical fiction to be heavier on the historical than fiction.",3.0,0,2022

Pretty good,"What I liked most is the straightforward and to the point list of approved DASH foods. Also loved description nof why each food is good, and its nutrients.

Many of the foods in this book have high potassium:and high protein - ""no-no"" for kidney issues.

But one of the MCs has a thing for moderate humiliation, and the other obliges. I was able to read the book without being uncomfortable except in a couple of very brief instances.<br /><br />It's sexy and hot, as you'd expect from Kelly Fox, with an interesting storyline and quite timely themes.

Further Editing Needs to be done on this Book,"I was really looking forward to reading this book.  Unfortunately, it is written very poorly.  The flow is choppy, and the grammar is terrible.  Was this book even edited by an editor? There was a lack of use of commas.  Commas are required before the words -and, but, for, or, and so- linking two independent clauses.  Also, it’s written almost like a screenplay with a lot of dialogue and not much in the way of the surrounding description.  One of the problems is that the sentences in the dialogue contain mostly 3-5 words.  It just doesn’t give the reader a feeling of smooth reading.  The way it’s written reminds me of the novels my son used to read in fifth grade.<br /><br />The plot had so much potential just based on reading the description.  I really like the storyline, and the characters are likable.  However, it was very difficult to read the book.  Hopefully, the next book isn’t of the same quality.",1.0,0,2022
How did I miss it?,"Ann is one of my favorite authors with her crisp, linear, detailed writing style.

Don't know how I missed this one as I usually jump for her work as soon as published.<br /><br />Sample line - ""It was a very pretty statue as those things go, maybe a foot and a half high, carved from rosewood and painted with such a delicate hand that many generations later her cheeks still bore the high, translucent flush of a girl startled by a compliment.""

After a surprise overwhelming attack, which killed most of the earth’s population, the survivors in Little Creek included a few students, and several adults from middle age to retired, male and female, most of whom had not interacted before.  Mr. James gave us a deep look at each character, following their development in coming together to form some sort of survival plan, and learning how to defend themselves against the large, powerful spider-like aliens.  They had no super heroes, or special forces troops or sophisticated weaponry; they had to make do with what they had.  The story line was well-thought-out and presented our friends with rapidly-changing deadly situations that required teamwork and thinking outside the box.  The suspense kept building as the hard-to-kill aliens appeared to be coordinated in how they attacked in overpowering numbers eating the people as food, and were quickly reproducing to increase their force.  I was fully engrossed in the story, turning the pages to see what would happen next.  Could our friends possibly gain any advantage and stay alive?  I have read and enjoyed many of Mr. Jones’ books.

Oohhhh Noooo….. 3rd Book??….,"I had no idea there would be a 3rd book!? (Umm… there will be, right??)<br />As I never would have chosen this “mini series” if I’d known it wasn’t yet complete.<br />I only choose whole series because — well, who wants to wait a year to read the next part of a book? Then another 6 months, then 15 months, and so on. To finish 8 to 12 books which make up an entire story? Not I.<br />I had similar experience once, when I realized one of my favorite, extremely long, series came out with 2 new additional books to the already, supposedly completed, storyline.<br />It had been so long since I had read the original books, that the smaller details were lost to me. Of course I recalled the overall story, but not the individual trees in the forest, which made the series so special, you know?<br />So - I had to start all over. Read book after book after book in series once again so I could truly dig into and enjoy the 2 new books. On the same level I did the 1st time around when reading the original series.<br />All that said — CLEARLY there will be a 3rd book here. (Or more…??) The ending isn’t the type where things are left loosely untied, while still, frustratingly, making sense somehow.<br />Nope. This was the typical abrupt ending of a dystopian book within a series.<br />*sigh* I only hope I notice the 3rd book before I forget about this entire story.<br />Because it’s a really great one.<br />Of course!

Since this book's ratings will stay at about 4.5, I feel OK about saying that I COULD NOT STAND this hero. SO BAD.  (mild spoilers):<br />Rowan is ridiculously horrible, with no real justification. He knows he needs an heir, he tells her he won't force her and that someday she will ""beg"" for his attentions, and then he is inexplicably horrible. Refuses to show her respect in front of his people, determined to ""break"" her (why?? how does he think this will help him get an heir??), refuses to give her proper clothing and then when her death is imminent is somehow furious that she doesn't immediately put on the clothing he ordered, is shocked that she has been abused by his mom (though apparently he was watching the whole time?), and is a complete jealous creep when any man shows her kindness. By the end of his unexplained (or really dumbly explained) awfulness, I felt sick at the idea that she might ever like him. In fact, when he says ""I'm unworthy of you"" suddenly I had the hope that she was actually meant for Merek! No such luck, at least so far.<br /><br />A few other things that were hard to swallow: she's so desperate to have a name, he finally says, ""you can choose your own name!"" and then she just....doesn't seem to care about it enough to do it. She's supposedly strong, but the book is full of gratuitous examples of her failing, physically. Just a LITTLE success in this area would have made her a much stronger character.

Evan is so swoon-worthy,"""Ye canna run forever, my obstinate lass. I mean to chase ye until ye run into my arms."" ~Evan Gordonstone, Duke of Waycross<br /><br />Evan is positively swoon-worthy. He's tall, handsome, honorable beyond reproach, and has some money issues. He's working on being a top horse breeder and trainer in Scotland in an effort to keep his family afloat after his father and eldest brother passed away, leaving him a duke. He's inherited the dukedom and all that goes with it, including the debts. Between his sisters, mother, and aunts, he has ten women to look after, but he never complains and is doing the best he can do with what he's got. He wasn't counting on running into the hoyden American woman, Sophronie Slater at a horse race nor was he counting on her and her father becoming house guests.<br /><br />Sophronie and Evan had met before and they couldn't seem to keep their irritation for each other under control. They didn't like each other at all. She thought he was arrogant and insensitive. He thought she was unladylike and belligerent. She was an American and didn't care what the ton or anyone else thought of her, but she did want to make her father proud and was determined to not embarrass him at this function and that included being nice to the Duke of Waycross.<br /><br />I don't want to put any spoilers in this because it's a marvelous story, but Evan and Sophronie end up marrying against both their wishes. The circumstances mitigated it. After that, she wanted an annulment. He wanted to make a go of it. To see and feel these two falling in love with their only common ground being experts on horses and the love of them was so satisfying. He saw some errors in his ways as she saw some in hers and it was hard for them to put their past behind them and create a future.<br /><br />This was a beautiful hate-to-love story with great characters, some moments that had me choked up, some humor, and a great ending.

Updated Reviews,"Okay so you know how if you eat a pickle then taste a banana the banana taste strange? Well that was how my original review of this book was one star.<br /><br />I clicked on it Nov 2022 and saw I had gotten a few chapters in.  Gave it another go.  It wasn't so bad.<br /><br />Then SPOILER WARNING: Then at around the 15 chapter, this possessive man allowed another man in their intimacies but the scene was lackluster and silly. If you are going to be different and go for<br />poly situation then go all out.  They teased you with it.  So someone into this turn will be upset and for those that aren't just leave it all the way out.  Waste of space.<br /><br />Then next issue was chapter 20.  This seemingly strong female got all broken up and worried over being judged about something that wasnt her fault and not even that interesting.  Well her ex boyfriend from 9 years ago, who was committing statutory rape committed suicide and the reaction from her sister and her was irritating.  This author made these characters weird.<br /><br />If she is breaking down over something that happened nine years ago and stating because she resorted to drugs when he died,  so now she can't commit to a serious relationship.  Plaleeezzze stop the tomfoolery.<br /><br />I am done it was hot scenes and basically a great enemies to lovers situation that held a lot of heat.  Then it got kind of dumb.  It may get better but not taking the chance to see if they are going to continue on this route. The  'If I date, I will pop pills again like I did as a teen.' route  Smh.

It was actually really good for a while, until the two above mentioned ridiculous situations.<br /><br />Sept 2022 Couldn't get past chapter two.  This was repetitive and strange.

"Funny, informative, amazing writing with wonderful characters!  I❤ Cal and Mabel!","Farm to Mabel is book one in the Farm to Mabel duet and not your average romance. I love the name!! This book is informative, romantic, and so funny. Do not read this when you're hungry either! Mabel lives in a farming community and her brother, his best friend Callan, and the town are trying to make all of the farms sustainable and organic. Mabel is not interested in any of it. She has dreams of fashion, big cities, and being a social influencer. Tragically, her brothers passes and after some heated words she leaves town to make her dreams come true. After years in the city, things happen and Mabel returns to the farm. The timing couldn't have been better for Elverna! Mabel learns a lot about herself, what she is capable of, and how to be true to who she is without being selfish. She also learns a lot about Callan. She thought many things about him, but hid her feelings behind snarkiness and by striking out at him. Callan hid his feelings by ignoring her. The book really illustrates how a goal can be accomplished by working together and trying new things. It also shows these two navigating their new relationship and trying to get past old hurts. I loved the info on sustainable farming and how communities were/are affected by changes in the industry. A domino effect that can go either way. It really opens up a new perspective. The writing is awesome! I loved the banter and I laughed out loud so many times.<br />Horn of Plenty is book two in the Farm to Mabel duet. The name is awesome! Very clever and fitting! Horn of Plenty starts where Farm to Mabel left off and wow! Things get sweet and hot! Mabel and Callan are finally giving in to their desires. Things are great,but there are still questions and demons from the past that need to be addressed. They have fallen into a great rhythm with each other and in their quest to save the town. When things reach a boiling point,they have to make some big decisions. I loved the chemistry between these two. You can really feel their love for each other! The broody farmer has a very soft side,but only for Mabel and his grandmother. Other characters really shine too. Elias, Mabel's dad is someone I would love to know as well as the old Young sisters. I love how the town truly works together and is open to new things for the greater good. Again, the writing is awesome, the characters are fun and real. There are so many laugh out loud moments, I had to take a break to gather myself. This book/duet was a joy to read!",5.0,1,2022
Yay! I have a new author to read!!,"Nelson, the rescue English bull terrier Liz has had for five months, wakes her up every morning at 6:30. Liz always takes Nelson to the graveyard on the grounds of the Benedictine Abbey ruins. When they get there, Liz takes Nelson off his leash and he takes off looking for rabbits to chase. Nelson does not find rabbits, he finds a body instead. This story has some action, plenty of investigating, small-town busybodies, and ends with a question. Highly recommended.",5.0,1,2022
Disappointing,"I've read almost everyone of Nicholas books and loved them. This one just didn't feel the same. Ordinarily at some point in his books I become emotionally invested,  on the edge of my seat, not able to turn the pages fast enough.

First Book In A Good Series,"I like the mystery in the story and how it is solved in the story, overall. But I found one aspect of how the story is presented to be very annoying, enough that I deducted one star in my rating. The main character is unrealistically naive for the mother of two grown children. Jake warns DeeDee  to be careful and tells her to keep Balto with her while she is investigating a murder. DeeDee thinks Jake is being ridiculous and is reluctant at best and rebellious. But I bet if her daughter was taking the same risks, DeeDee would tell her daughter to be more careful! DeeDee is too reckless for an untrained woman investigating a murder. And that recklessness is not necessary for the plot of the story to work. I am a very adventurous woman, but I would not have been that naive as a ten year old. Fortunately Jake came to the rescue, and fortunately DeeDee does better in the rest of the series. So I recommend this book as the start of the series.",4.0,1,2022
Zero plot. Zero character development. 100% fan service,"I have loved this series up til the last book, which I thought was just ok. This one is not as good as that one though, and I don't even really think the author is trying to make it be good anymore either.<br /><br />There is no plot to speak of. Characters just appear in places with no explanation, dead characters come back to life, people die and are not mourned, etc etc. Every scene is essentially independent of the ones before and after it.<br /><br />There is no character development to speak of. No one learns anything, changes in any meaningful way, or does anything that surprises you. Several characters literally just chant the same sentences over and over in every scene rather than think coherent thoughts or have meaningful conversations.<br /><br /> On almost every page though, you will get pure fan service. There are a million Star Wars references. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, college football, indie games that I'm pretty sure were released after Jim left Earth, all of these get multiple mentions. Characters frequently break the fourth wall to discuss how they're not sure that the reader is going to get that obscure joke/reference they just made. Badgelor pretends to be Indiana Jones. Someone pretends to be Gollum. Jim pretends to be someone else, I can't even remember.<br /><br />The main point of this book seems to be to reassure the reader that the author has read all the same books you have, watched all the same movies you have, and enjoyed them all just as much as you did. It is immersion breaking. It lowers the stakes of the story by constantly reminding you that it's just a story. It's tedious after awhile. Plus, honestly, some of these ""jokes"" aren't funny the first time and by the 10th repetition they really really aren't funny. I will admit some of them do land but the entire book is just the author saying ""ha what if Jim were a teacher at Hogwarts!"" or ""ha, what if Jim was Aragorn from Return of the King!"" or whatever, over and over.<br /><br />I get that some people read books or watch shows and enjoy ""finding"" blindingly obvious in-jokes that are about as out-joke as you can get, but in this case the jokes represent the entire meat of the book. Nothing meaningful really happens and there are about five sub-plots, none of which are really resolved. We get a yoghurt joke that goes on for five pages though, so glad we had that and not an explanation of what happened to make Charles evil.<br /><br />Anyway I enjoyed reading it because I'm invested in the characters at this point but this is by far the weakest book and it represents a series of poor decisions that make me wonder if the series is going to be concluded satisfactorily.",3.0,0,2022

A whole cast of unlikeable non-heroes.,"I imagine that the author intended for his characters to be more classic anti-heroes than what I felt they were.  Honestly I've reached the point where I shake my head when I realize that the main character is not going to be a more traditional hero and the author is new.  Experienced authors try to avoid anti-hero main characters most of the time as they are extremely hard to make likable.<br /><br />but Andrew wasn't content with just a main character who is less than heroic.  Every single member of the crew has a secret that they obsessively keep.  This group fights constantly.  They are all extremely worried about attention for law enforcement.  They are all running from something.  Honestly, there is no way this group could hold together, but Andrew uses a number of plot devices to force them to remain as a group as they stumble from planet to planet and set piece to set piece.<br /><br />The story itself is imaginative and well written, but I disliked the characters and their joint obsessive nature.  None of these characters was presented as what they really were, and that was only pounded home by their constant non conversations about the secrets they were keeping.<br /><br />Not my kind of story, and I know I'll avoid this author in the future.  But some might like this, so I will give it 3 stars.",3.0,0,2022

Great solid world foundation results in an intriguing tale,"The thing that stuck me the most about this tale was not the well-rounded and ground character, nor the nice flow to the plot that showed the growth of Taroniah over the four years that pass in this book.  While those are all impressive and definitely lended themselves to making this a solid tale that I can recommend, the superstar in this book is something that was subtle.  Peter took the time to build his world.<br /><br />I know that might not make sense, but hear me out.  In this book Taroniah is the illegitimate daughter of a king who it is discovered has magic.  As part of that discovery she goes to the obligatory magic academy to be taught.  While she's there she begins researching the ""Great War"" and the disappearance of magic that occured after it partly due to the Revilers.  This all happened hundreds of years in the past, before this book is supposed to be occuring.  Yet, you can see how that war affects Taroniah's life and the development of magic at the academy.  I so rarely see such a strong foundation for a tale that it only heightened my delight to discover a well thought out coming of age tale about a young woman who is far more than the convenient love interest for some handsome and dashing man.  Romance doesn't really show up in this tale as Taroniah discovers a love of magic and developing her skills, even to the point of developing new spells from the tales of the Great War and the sorcerers who once walked the lands.<br /><br />If I had any complaint its the ending, which leaves no obvious hooks for a future tale, and yet doesn't completely resolve Taroniah's future.  I wanted more.<br /><br />But that is usually a good thing.  This is definitely one of the better tales I've read recently and deserves a high four star rating.",4.0,1,2022
"If you like Cat & Mouse romances, this book is for you!","SPOILERS:<br />Cat & Mouse Romance with a lot of sex scenes.  Most annoying.  They hate each other. They crave each other.  They finally get together, have lots of sex, break up, whine and mope, and get back together again.  Everyone happy at the end.  Very predictable.  Cheesy.  Nothing profound.  Good for a reader who wants something not-brain-taxing after reading too many WWII historical fiction books.  What’s with all of the weird names and nick names?  Naomi is Daisy (got that, she had her wedding daisies still in her hair), Daze, Not Tina, Nay and Goody.  Lucian is Lucy.  We’ve got a kid named Waylay and dog name Waylon.  How weird is that?  Of course, just to be as diverse and inclusive as possible, we had to have the male gay best friend Stef, the two women raising some girl and the two men raising another child.  That’s all honorable but did the author follow a diversity and inclusion checklist?  Oh wait, no Asians.  Did we have a bi-racial couple?  We had “dark skinned” mentioned but, does that mean Black or Hispanic?  The Code Red women menstruating together blurb made me think I was back in the 60’s or 70’s hearing crass guys talk.  At 20% I realized I could throw in the towel or just stick with it and get to the end.  I stuck with it.  Nothing to rave out.  Mostly tacky.  I don’t feel like I totally wasted my time or brain cells.  However, I could have read/done something more productive.  If you just want to escape and chill, this book is for you.  Don’t expect more than that.  Glad it only cost $4 and change.",2.0,0,2022
Nice series,"Fiona Valpy’s Escape to France series includes three books:<br />Light Through the Vines<br />The Recipe for Hope<br />The Seasons of Dreams<br />These books are light reading, enjoyable, and romantic but not sappy and mindless.  Each follow a similar format:  British woman gets jilted, goes to France (or already lives in a Chateaux in France), and falls in love with a handsome, local French guy.  Happy endings all around.  The books also deal with relevant issues:  a wedding venue and the various flavors of weddings, a stillborn baby with the sadness and depression accompanying that loss, losing one’s father, aunt, job and boyfriend.  Nice stories.  It was hard to tell the correct reading order of these three books.  The publication order doesn’t correspond to the story-order.  Light Through the Vines would be first because Thomas hasn’t met/married Sara yet.  Eliane and Mireille from the the earlier WWII novels (Dressmaker’s Gift and Beekeeper’s Promise) re-appear and make the stories more interesting.  Overall, lovely stories making me wish I lived in the French countryside.",4.0,1,2022

"Too Much Fluff, Not Enough Substance","This book was my first experience with this author. I felt like the story had a lot to offer and it was intriguing the first few chapters. But beyond chapter 3, and all the way till the last word, this entire story was nothing but a huge will-they-or-won't-they. Both of the characters waffled back and forth with a 'should we or shouldn't we'. There was very little action and not enough substance to keep my interest. The heroine had very little backbone. She almost never stood up for herself and just went along with whatever the hero demanded. And then to end the book on a 'to be continued', that was cruel and unnecessary torture in my opinion. I can only hope the plot, as well as the characters, are better fleshed out in the subsequent stories.",1.0,0,2022

Savy is a whole idiot,"I have never despised a main character as much as I do her. I know the author wants her to come across as strong and making her own way while fighting destiny but she just comes across as dumb. Never takes time to learn abt ppl or both sides of what she is so that she can make smart moves.  It never reads well or comes across the way the author wants when trying to make the mate bond seem as if it's taking away choice. You can't want us to like that they are mates and then make her seem like she has been handed the worst deal known to man.<br /><br />Oh you have a cute, strong, man looking after you. Oh you are now strong and fast. Woe is you. She doesn't listen and heads into danger while putting everyone at risk and then never deals w the consequences of her actions. Make it make sense. This book was frustrating as hell. It has the potential to be great but falls short due to the writing dealing w the main characters. I liked seeing characters from another series that I didn't realize was written by this duo. Although now it also makes sense as that main character was also fighting the inevitably and looking for fault where there wasn't any. I wish I hadn't started this series. I wish I could give it 2 and a half stars. There are dregs of a good story here but parts are strung along that don't need to be and important parts aren't explained enough.",3.0,0,2022

"Read all 300 pages at once, loved it!  Fascinating.","I loved the story and found it understandable, fascinating, and different from any other story I've read.  I'd buy another book from this author. There are lots of surprises, a romance, a house that's alive, very likable people, plus the bad guy.  I especially loved the amazing house.  This is a fun book, and since the main characters are caring people trying to do their best, except for the bad guy, you'll come away laughing and smiling.<br /><br />The people that give it low reviews, from what they say, haven't read much of the book.  In one case, they didn't get past the first few pages. Addressing the negative comments:<br />- Yes, the story starts out with the bad guy as a teenager with a drunken father that beats him, but the boy wins a few pages later by using magic.  This sets up the backstory for the bad guy.<br />- There are only two time periods - one for the bad guy and one for the good guy, and in the second half of the book, it becomes one timeline once they meet. I didn't find it difficult to follow.<br />- The main character is a writer, so sometimes, laughingly, you'll see him use some high-end words, but it's easy to understand their meaning from the context or from the explanation he gives afterwards.<br /><br />So I don't think the negative reviews are very valid.",5.0,1,2022
Warmed over Law of Atraction.,"Let's see. Spirit Guides, Archangels, Guardian Angles, Ascended masters, etc. Anywhere from 7 to hundreds depending on the type of celestial body you might want to work with. But here's the deal. How do you know? The author isn't going to tell you. So instead you get lengthy descriptions of who is who and who and how to call on the entity needed at the time. The problem is, after 50 or 60 pages of names and explanations, how do you remember the names, their specialties, how they might help, and how to get in touch. It's like: if this than that. But the this and that, names and specialties, are buried 30, 40 or 50 pages back. So you spend more time trying to figure out who and how to access these entities, even if you can remember the right name and how they might help, you're so stressed out and confused about doing the right thing that expecting positive results is a long shot at best. My advise: forget these books that offer ""contact with the spirit world"" and pray to God, or Source or Creator or your preferred name and ask for guidance. With a reverent and humble approach, God will direct the proper entities for your unique needs. Notice how many of these books have been written over the past year. Yes, it's been a trying time, and the authors know people are looking for something to grasp onto so, they write a book of warmed over wisdom that most resembles the Law of Attraction. After book number 3, and taking the steps to get my money back, I've decided to stick with my prayers to God and if I want something to read I find an inspiring piece of well written fiction. Stick with the Creator for wisdom and guidance.",1.0,0,2022
If you liked Alpha World and other similar books this is a Good Harem LitRPG Series,"Sure it started off a bit slow I read pretty fast and I enjoyed the book I picked up the series once I found out it was related to Alpha World didn't find out about that until book 3 reviews, although by book two any Alpha World readers might have figured it out. This is more like a spin-off in another VR world (Delta World). Note that it is a Harem-type book so not all readers will be into it.<br /><br />Kinda reminded me of a Role Master character a buddy of mine had and mine. I rolled a Paladin with some crazy skills but one of them was weapon break (which would be considered a bad skill, because of that one bad trait I had some extra great skills). Had a buddy of mine roll something similar to the MCs (Main Characters) aka protagonist. Anyway fun read although I recommend getting all 3 since the end of book 1  although some people don't like harem mushy stuff where it ended. After all, they've only been through the starter set of 3 dungeons and don't even have a full group. So I can understand some of the hate.

A Miss for Me,"I’ve read and enjoyed every book by Mary Kingswood, so it pains me to say that I struggled to get through this one primarily because the female protagonist, Eloise, who I found to be unbelievably tedious.  I understood her rationale for her actions through the first half of the book but beyond that point, she just seemed mean and manipulative, persisting in what I believe to be, wholly unfair treatment of Will, our hero.  As a consequence, I found myself more angry with Eloise, than understanding.<br /><br />The tedium set in when I began to wonder not ‘if’ they’d get to their HEA, but how much more of Eloise’s ill treatment of Will I’d have to read before getting there.  Eloise keeps testing his gentlemanly qualities as he’s jumping through hoops nine ways from Sunday to live up to her standards.  Eloise frequently notes that he’s meeting her expectations but she doesn’t trust them to be anything but superficial compliance.  Bottom line, I felt that there was just a bit too much repetitiveness if this plot element.  Will just never seems to be able to catch a break with our dear Eloise.<br /><br />All of that said, the ‘kiss-and-make-up’ scene was movie quality writing.

He's a bit too into Verne at the moment, IMO, and it's affecting his storytelling. The innovation and imagination of his other works are lacking in this book.<br /><br />The book is well written.

Back to Summer on Nantucket,"I look forward to Ms. Hilderbrand's Nantucket novels each summer. This season a derelict hotel is bought by an English mogul, and to impress two women, he is restoring it to heights not seen on the island. Lizbet with broken ties to the Deck restaurant, is thrilled to be made general manager. There are two narrators, one unknown and the other Grace, a ghost from the past. It is written in the present tense in both cases. I liked the premise and the very vivid description of the hotel's restoration.  Nantucket destinations are sprinkled about as in other books which may bring back memories to those who have visited but are just name dropping, to me. One reason for the three stars is that the large cast of characters are dealt with superficially; I never really liked any or understood them - Chad may be an exception. I was not invested in the romances, the trials of the employees, or in the slight mystery of the two women to impress. The tone of the book is chatty, breezy and lacked depth, to me. The final reason for the stars given is the incredible overuse of parentheses and exclamation points! A quote from the book is that a hotel is hello-goodbye, impermanent.

"'The Girl Who Wants' makes you laugh, cry, & sigh...","Titled as ""fast-paced,"" I already agreed by the time I was part of way into the second chapter.

"Morsels of truth, embedded in dubious pseudo-""science""","This book should get five stars for originality and willingness to question long-established paradigms, as well as the occasional insights into what went wrong with the so-called SAD (standard American diet). However--and this is a big however--the author takes unforgivable liberties in espousing untested theories, buttressed by generalities and romanticized notions of Italian culture and eating habits. The allure of the author's theories does not withstand scientific scrutiny and is unsupported by reliable, well-designed peer-reviewed studies. I'm still glad I read the book because it encourages much needed critical thinking about SAD eating and culture, and raises important questions about their threat to health and wellbeing, but take the rest of it with a grain of salt--hoping the book won't do more harm than good in those who will accept its theories unquestioningly.",2.0,0,2022

Fantastic value; be prepared to learn a lot about yourself and your ancestors,"I bought the Kindle version of this book in the summer of 2021 to participate in a study group using the book.<br /><br />Each chapter takes a lot of time and energy to work through. The work has been deeply valuable to me.<br /><br />The author's instructions are clear and are accompanied by examples that she walks through so you can understand the processes and the reasons for those processes.<br /><br />You don't have to do every exercise in the book (and there are a LOT), but I recommend doing as many as you can in each chapter. Don't rush. If you want, you can read the book all the way through first to get an idea of the overall focus and flow, then go back and start working your way through each chapter.<br /><br />The author encourages you to keep a journal recording your discoveries, and I concur. You may see patterns that you might have otherwise missed if you didn't keep track.

Amazing book!,"I really loved this book so much, everything in it resonated so much with me. Slowing life down, cutting back on (or getting rid of) superfluous technology, and enjoying life on our own terms. So much to absorb and implement, this is my favorite book of the year, so far.",5.0,1,2022
A real page-turner!!,"This exciting start of a new series is a page-turner that hooked me early and kept me engrossed.  Detective Sergeant Jack Lisbon, an ex-boxer turned cop, left his birthplace, London, several years ago, under less than desirable circumstances, headed for Australia.  As a beat cop, he tried to clean up his act, manage his temper, and quit drinking and smoking.  He earned a promotion, which sent him from Brisbane to the near-tropical northern Australian city of Yorkville.  The normally quiet town is shocked by several new developments: a local resident goes missing, a car is discovered empty, motor still running, with blood stains, and a body that had been mauled by an alligator is found tangled in mangrove roots.  However, these items weren’t necessarily connected, leading Jack and his partner, Detective Constable Claudia Taylor on a frustrating trail full of twists and turns that takes them into the MMA fighting circuit.  Jack is back in his element, with all its competition among fighters and coaches, drug addiction, and criminal activity.  Jack has a history of using his own methods of getting information and handling suspects.  The police are having a hard time making progress on these cases, so the press and the public are hounding them to catch the culprit(s).  Can Claudia keep Jack calm and following proper decorum?<br />Mr. Denholm is adept at creating strong characters, vivid descriptions and an intriguing story line that make the reader a part of the action.  He slowly builds tension that keeps the reader trying to solve the case.  Some readers might be put off by some of the gritty language and activities, but I found it appropriate to the scenario – people really do talk and act like that.  I believe it helped me to have read the prequel story for background, but the books in this series are great as stand-alone stories.  I am thoroughly enjoying this series and highly recommend it.",5.0,1,2022
What a ride!,"I don’t know how I came across this book, but I’m so glad I did. I now have another go-to author for great suspense.<br />The story moves back and forth from the present day with Nora as a successful surgeon hiding from what happened 26 years ago when Nora was an eleven year old child.<br /><br />Nora’s running from the past—because her father is a serial killer. Things get really suspenseful when two of Nora’s patients end up dead, and with their hands severed—a signature of her father’s work.<br /><br />Just before the killings start, Nora runs into her college boyfriend of 3 months and starts up a shaky relationship with him.<br /><br />Guessing who is the killer was great fun. The author gives plenty of hints but I didn’t guess until it was obvious.<br />What makes me the happiest about this book, is that I found the author in the middle of her career so there are plenty more books to read. I ordered another one as soon as I finished this one. I’ll let you know how it goes.",5.0,1,2022

Too tidy,"Fern Michaels tells a good story and does a fine job building background for each character. But then, suddenly, in the last six or so pages, every crisis is resolved, everyone is redeemed, and “they all live happily ever after” (presumably). The sheer terror that Ellie experiences throughout 95% of the book is suddenly apologized away on the last page. The violent, abusive husband has an epiphany, and in a few hours suddenly turns his life around. And the victimized woman is dating the rescuing angel before she has even  filed for divorce — not a good idea. It’s as if the hurricane is on the radar, the area is evacuated, the storm flags are raised — and then it turns out to be a blown fuse. The excellent development Ms. Michaels clearly demonstrates throughout the main portion of the book needs to carry through to the resolution and conclusion.",4.0,1,2022
Love this series…,"The beauty of these stories is the writing.  It easily flows from page to page with engaging dialog.  Make no mistake, the plotlines are first rate, the characters engrossing and the storyline captivating.  Lieutenant, now Captain (Brevet) Fortis is the type officer everyone trooper deserves. Dedicated to the Corps, his men yet possessing a humanity that allows caring to be interspersed throughout for all involved.  Fortis, reunited with Gunny Ystremski, now commands a Recon company that is the tip of the spear during the invasion of Maltaani.  Of course, the entire success of the invasion depends upon Fortis accomplishing his mission, no excuses and no extraction for failure.

Yet another excellent entry in The series,"This series has become one of my favorites, competing with John Sandford and David Balducci as automatic purchases immediately upon publication. The plot has characters whose way of life is so foreign to me, yet at the same time whose experiences are ones I can easily relate to. Kate, the lead character is multidimensional, interesting and so very human in her foibles.  Her spunk and dogged determination are admirable.<br />While I figured out the ending fairly early on, it in no way detracted from enjoying the book to the end. The unique setting within the Amish community and interweaving of their practices and beliefs make this book unique in its genre.<br />If you have not read these books I would suggest you start with the first one. While not necessary to understanding and enjoying later entries, it does serve to fill in the background and history of the characters.",5.0,1,2022
nice characters but missing world building and cliffhanger ending didn’t make it for me,"Rating: 2.5🌈<br /><br />I was looking forward to this book based on the blurb and some of the reviews, but it was definitely not the story I anticipated.  Btw, spoilers ahead.<br /><br />First of all there is no solid world building here. The Infidelity Clause by Lisa Olivier was lacking in a consistent foundation for its storylines.  It’s missing huge parts of its universe, especially anything relatable to a magical element.  That was almost a nonexistent item here, although supposedly it was a major factor in the health of the peoples, education , and foundation of the kingdoms.<br /><br />Oliver’s plot veered between the “whimsical” historical comedy the blurb referenced and a realistic drama that factors in people with pasts that contain sexual assault, suicide, family abuse, and abandonment. More about the abundance of plot elements later.<br /><br />The story revolves around a marriage clause called a Infidelity Clause referred to by the characters as a “piss off “ clause repeatedly.  Why? Because if broken, one of the partners of the contract can, well, you guess it.<br /><br />The intention here is that  the marriage was going to be a temporary contract.  It all starts off so lightly.  A way faring Prince, will wed a ne’er do well “loves to party”prince in a comedy of errors! Sounds fab!<br /><br />The author has chosen names of the countries and neighboring kingdoms along the lines of Gumflumple, ( actually Gunkermal)  with a actual heir , a stepbrother, to a throne called Paragon. Not the main characters. So I figured this was not a story I was supposed to take seriously.<br /><br />It was if Oliver started out writing a broad comedy, then because she couldn’t decide where to take the characterizations, so she moved them and the storylines all over the place.  From light fun which then took a dark turn into stark murderous drama!<br /><br />Broad comedy, sex and sexual awakening, drama, murder mystery, murder attempts, action suspense, romance, pirates and sea battles, a pinch of steampunk and a  scoosch of tiny magical doings too . Oh and a character with disabilities and mentions of several past sexual assaults to others.  The entire kitchen of narrative elements was absolutely tossed into the book here . I believe I’ve left out some.  Like the smh names of some people and items.<br /><br />I liked the characters, but the story they are running around in is a mess.  Main elements have no foundation. Small characters play a big part , then several mentions, then disappear.  Pop back in. Gone again.<br /><br />It’s got the feeling of a grab bag of narrative elements that just keep getting thrown in without the necessary exposition to glue it together.<br /><br />But the worst? The way it was ended.<br /><br />“Which was why, when the knocking at the door started, he ignored it, and encouraged Caspian to ignore it too.<br /><br />To Be Continued.”<br /><br />— The Infidelity Clause: One of those MM crown princes, arranged marriages books by Lisa Oliver<br /><br /> The author excuses herself by saying she’s decided to write another book, so she’s leaving them here.<br /><br />Like that absolves her of the decision to complete a book a person has paid for and has the expectation of getting a finished , polished product.<br /><br />Which, imo, this is not.<br /><br />So read it if you’re a fan of the author. Or if the blurb intrigues you.  I’m giving the next book a pass.",2.0,0,2022

Definitely hit home!,"Principal characters named Mick and Troy are what attracted me to this, as well as the 60's coming of age aspect. My nickname is Mick.

I can also remember taking a few days leave from my small New England college for some sexual adventures in Albany as does the character Mick. Unlike him, I discovered early that the sheepskin was the key to getting your ticket punched in real life so did not experience Mick's round the world ambles.

Brutal,"Jon Athan writes about a very real issue in the most brutal way filled with the absolute raw emotions of a dad searching for his little girl kidnapped by someone. I had to put this one down a lot. The horrific details where too much to stomach but in all honesty very real situations. I struggled with this one. The content is absolute real life we don't talk about the details like this so the very idea of Jon Athan writing it like this gives you the feels of the dad and part of me wanted to hate him for what he was doing and part of me wanted him to keep going. I felt those emotions as Andrew carried out his own investigation feeling the police weren't doing enough. I was surprised at his actions but also understood his anger and need to find Grace, his daughter. My 4 stars is for the writing. I imagine it wasn't easy to research and write this book. In a world full dark places Jon finds a way to portray the dark into a battle of a good person wanting to do what's right but doing it with the wrong actions. Vigilante or a dad doing everything possible to find his kidnapped little girl? The ending surprised me. I was left feeling happy for the answers but horrified by the means to them. Not my usual read at all and I'm not one to quit a book once I start it but I don't suggest reading unless you are prepared to stomach the very gruesome details of how the awful money making of pornographic violence exists in the real world.

"Quirky and Charming, but has a scene","I am on a Christmas kick so when this one was recommended to me I actually bought the book.  I loved the story overall, but there were a few places that bothered me.  I love the humor and sarcasm, and the whole idea of sitting on a plane every year for 10 years and developing a friendship helped create a unique story.  It really reminded me of the story One Day except all set at Christmas time.<br /><br />Here were my issues:<br />--I paid money for this book outside of my normal KU and it has several edit errors.<br />--There's a lot of build on the romance and then there's a pretty descriptive scene on Christmas Day in the parent's tiny, old farmhouse.  The main character has just met the parents.<br />--Almost immediately after said scene the main characters have a semi-dramatic parting that didn't work for me.<br /><br />I did like how the conflict is resolved-loved that part really.  If it hadn't been for the edit errors and the  descriptive scene this would have been a 5 star read for me.<br /><br />Content: Recovering alcoholic, alcoholism, innuendo, and a descriptive sex scene<br />Language:  There were some almost f-bombs, but I don't think there were actually any...some other swears but mostly mild<br />Religious: Not religious<br /><br />Happy reading!!",3.0,0,2022

this was a difficult book to read.. like.... finish!,"First, the moving after mourning and starting a new life in a new place really works for me.<br />Sadly, there were more things that DID NOT work, that really made me irritated with the book and disappointed with the author.<br /><br />PLEASE please PLEASE for the love of all that is holy PLEASE EDIT THIS MESS AGAIN!!!!!!!!<br />-There are some spelling errors, I can overlook that (it happens).<br />-there are some wrong words used: change instead of chance, quite instead of quiet, and instead of a (etc)<br />-there were missing commas, this was annoying because I found myself rereading SO many sentences and paragraphs because the meaning was lost.<br />-there were sentences that did not even make sense (I really hope the author didn't actually pay someone to edit this)<br />*-there were sentences that were just wrong, like the author started speaking from one person then in the MIDDLE OF THE SENTENCE it is someone else speaking (WTF?!)<br />-- like this one.. ""the War God of Ares created"" when it should say ""the God of War, Ares, created"" OR ""Ares, the God of War, created"" (there were A LOT of errors like this.. A LOT!)<br />-there were many cringy seccx scene moments, like this: ""he sticks another finger into my wet cavern."" the author uses ""cavern"" when speaking of Clara's V 11 times, she uses ""his beast"" to describe the H's man parts<br /><br />Clara was another huge problem for me. First off, she is days away from her 20th birthday when she moves. She is introduced as quiet, shy, innocent and basically sheltered from years of being her aunt's caretaker. Yet when she moves she is so outgoing (walking into the diner and offering help when she only came to eat, she makes a point to get to know the customers, plays with the kids. Then she meets the alpha, and retracts into almost a child outside of the bedroom. She was so wishy washy and I honestly felt more connected to magic and adventure then I EVER did to Clara and Kane's ""relationship"".<br />Also, how all the men loved and wanted Clare... Kane (obviously because he's the H), Jasper, Marcelles, Sebastian, Ian (and his flock).. it was excessive.<br /><br />The damsel in distress got old.. she is kidnapped TWICE by the same person, then blackmailed into leaving with shady people again<br /><br />I honestly cannot even list the things that I didn't like about this book.

Too formulaic but good for beginners,"I have read Gwen Hayes' Romancing the Beat which is very interesting, although again, formulaic. Recently, a famous romance author did a survey with her readers on what would get a reader tired of an author, i.e. stop reading a particular author. One of the most repeated themes was: same basic story with different locations and characters. It comes with plugging in the beats. You can almost see where an author plugs in the beats. Setup, introduce character before meeting love interest. Boom. Cute or not so cute meet. Sparks fly but there's a glitch. Etc. Etc. Etc. with the requisite dark moment or break up followed by a grand romantic gesture. Believe me, if you've read as many books as I have, you just know what's going to happen after next. The attempted kiss is always interrupted by something. The ex always appears at an inopportune moment. The misunderstanding happens around 75% mark. Then there's the soul-searching and the wallowing ... check, check, check.<br /><br />The meat of the book, Chapter 7, which is the master outline is done by 25% of the book. The master outline is just an explanation of each of Gwen's beats. The rest is a blow-by-blow of how the author wrote one of her novels. It's a writing journal. I guess my main thing is that there was not really any new content that you couldn't have gotten from Romancing the Beat or any of the other how to write a romance books.<br /><br />There's really nothing given about interweaving subplots, secondary characters, or unexpected twists.

Mixed Feelings About This One,"This is the second book in the Crescent City series, not a stand alone.  For that matter, if you haven't read  the five books of the ACOTAR series, the last chapter of House of Sky and Breath will have little meaning  for you. It had great meaning for me. The problem is, I'm not sure I like that meaning.h<br />I have other issues with this book, as well. The first book in the series, House of Earth and Fire, set up  a lot of things that not only weren't paid off in the second book, but were simply jettisoned for other plot lines that seemed  to come out of nowhere.  An example of this is the Hypaxia/Ruhn relationship, or non-relationship. I couldn't buy into Ruhn's seeming disinterest in his betrothal to a woman he'd taken a great interest in during the first book. There's nothing to lead us from the point where he's attracted to her, to his being indifferent to her.  Same thing with her indifference to him, after the tentative offerings of closeness in the first book.  At the end of book one, they seem to be into each other, which bodes well for their betrothal.  At the start of book two, both seem to regard the betrothal as nothing more than a political necessity. We don't know how or why we went from budding romance to burdensome duty, and as a result, the new relationships each develops in the second book irritate rather than intrigue.  Moving on to other issues, the revelation about Baxion in relation to Danika just struck me as completely unbelievable. Exactly when would Danika have had time for that and how, or more importantly why, would she keep the matter hidden from Bryce?  Again, the revelation was irritating rather than intriguing.  On another front, I had hoped the Sofie plot line was going somewhere, but it seemed to come to a literal dead end.<br /><br />But, for me, the biggest irritation is that ending.  Yes, looking back, I can see a few tiny things that might be considered foreshadowing.  In  fact, I even got a giggle out of a couple of hints of this possibility in earlier books. But those hints and foreshadows not only didn't go far enough to set up what happens, I'm not at all sure I like what they set up. Now, to be fair to the author, I could be completely wrong about the advisability of this step. In the ACOTAR series, which has been my favorite of Maas' works,  she pulled off a really spectacular reversal between the first book and second book, and maybe she can do that, here.  In ACOTAR book one, she has you completely buy into the eternal love of Feyre and Tamlin, while in the second book, she completely dismantles that relationship and replaces it with the true eternal love of Feyere and Rhysand.  In doing so, Maas plays fair with her readers.  You can see the seeds planted in the first book that lead to what happens int he second, so you are not disappointed, but led gradually from Feyre/Tamlin to Feyre/Rhysand in completely believable, logical steps that make the whole thing feel inevitable and right.  Here, in the last chapter of HOSAB, Maas goes for something far more audacious. I have no idea if she can pull it off as elegantly  as she pulled off the re-pairing of Feyre with Rhysand after getting  you to love Feyre with Tamlin.  And, at the moment, I really don't like the idea of what she's trying to pull off, at all.  It feels forced to me, and I just don't see the point of it.  But, because of how she pulled off what she did in the ACOTAR series, I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt and pre-order the next book that comes out as soon as it becomes available.  Maybe the next book will change my mind and I'll come back and add another star to this review. Or maybe I'll give up on this series. But I haven't given up yet.",3.0,0,2022
"Wow, What A Great Book!","I usually don't write reviews since I read A LOT but had to on this one. I held off on reading for a while knowing it would cause flashbacks of our family's loss. I like to read fiction, nonreal to make me forget the ugly things in the world but I had to read it. The book is dark, accurate, and bleeds with grieving but shows light at the end. It's truly amazing how much this book touched me, those feelings of being lost. My husband's brother lost his battle to suicide 5-years ago and sent my husband to the dark side, it was hard, it ate him up inside (and still does). It took so long to pull him out but little by little he did. I now want to say I was his venom since he can't talk about it to anyone else. The unknowing, no note, no nothing left him never the same. Kellan is so well described along with Charlie along with their tragedies. The story flows so well from beginning to end. The feelings and hurt are so real and raw. As much as I dreaded reading this it left me feeling oddly strange in a better way, maybe a better understanding...I really can't say but it's a good way. I would probably read this again to decipher more of the lines that hit me like lightning! I couldn't put it down and had to push ahead to the end. A big round of applause to the writer of this book, it was beyond touching. Thank you!",5.0,1,2022
A Rare Jewel,"I never review books. I read several books per week and can not remember the last one I reviewed. I had to make an effort for this book- it is that good. In short, discerning readers will not be disappointed and will likely be very, very impressed with this book.<br /><br />WRITING QUALITY- is so very good. All writing is not literature. Ms Meyer/Brown writes with literary quality. The language is truly articulate and lacks the sameness of many in this genre while still being clearly of the genre. The narrative is engaging from the start. The humor is sharp yet accessible. The themes are thought provoking- religion, addiction, true kindness, self reliance, stereotypes are all handled with dignity and aplomb.<br />CHARACTERS are engaging and well depicted. One gets their individual feel through situation as well as description. The author does more than state the personality traits- she reinforces them in each conversation and reaction. Even the minor characters have well developed personalities and qualities. They really sparkle and bring the story to life.<br />PERIOD DETAILS are meticulously researched much like Georgette Heyer, but with a more wholesome/less silly attitude overall similar to Jane Austen. I especially loved the setting in Harrowgate with the smaller resort town feel. Clothing details seemed less “Disney” and more authentic than I often read in popular regency fiction.<br />DEPTH- This is hard to achieve. I love the sweet handling of difficult themes and the wonderful ability of the author to correct assumptions with kindness. She doesn’t preach on religious themes, stereotypes or gender roles but handles them with heart and kindness as a natural part of the story. A couple *should resolve religious questions as much as is possible before starting a family; and a hobby or occupation may not exist exclusively in the pigeon hole assigned by our society, etc.<br /><br />If you have read this far, please take the chance and give this one a read. I read this work on kindle but this author is going on my gift wish list for hard copy books, I enjoyed her so much. Cheers!",5.0,1,2022
Great book,Not sure what one reviewer is talking about because there is no bad language or anything inappropriate. The book is a mystery and a very good one.,5.0,1,2022
Good but doesn't match the hype,"Yes, it's inventive, clever, absorbing and at times beautifully mesmerizing.  It is also short (the text is VERY spaced out) and has the classic errors of many science fiction books.  It is much more a meditation than novel. Highest kudos go toward characters and plot twists.  The people seemed authentic, the action slow but continual and the Chandler-like noir atmosphere  beautiful.<br /><br />The science fiction aspect stands out as lacking.  It's far in the future and folks still read books, drive cars, meet at restaurants, etc - just as we did in 1970  Also there is no explanation of how time travel works. Even an invented one would have been helpful.  The semi-rushed ending (I read it again) needed something else - not exactly sure what is lacking- but certainly more explanation than the fact that the central character was also the cause of the entire anomaly.<br />My Grade - B+",4.0,1,2022
Sweet wholesome romance with dragons!,"I'm rather hooked on the sub genre of regency or Victorian tales with magic critters, but often the heroines are fairly one dimensional whereas I really liked that empathy and compassion were her heroic traits and that she was smart enough to use them in ways that made sense.<br /><br />The gentleman interest had enough reasons to be cold (literally) but his thawing made for a sweet romance that was wholesome enough to cause a toothache. Yet underlying all that is a fun multi national plot and twists that I'm looking forward to following through to the next book.",5.0,1,2022
Stop reading by Chapter 11,"I tried and I mean, I really tried because I have read other novels written by Christi Caldwell and liked them.  Heroine was really immature (almost airhead type immature).  The Hero was not the only one constantly confused by the Heroine's rambling, so was I.  Hero was relatable because of his grief and Heroine was not due to her rambling even though she attended Finishing School for 4 years.  Finishing School did not take as it should have; it would have be unheard of a young lady to introduce herself to a man and have child-like, borderline intimate conversations with a strange man.  Her musing and fear of ghosts and her fascination and constant bringing up of Jane Austen puts her mentality of that of pre-Finishing School (8-12 years old) instead of a woman ready to make her debut into society.<br />Like I said in my title, I had to quit reading this by Chapter 11.  Reading this was like the beginning of a slow throbbing toothache.  Disappointed!",2.0,0,2022
Unconventional,"This is my second Jayne Davis novel and I did enjoy it, although it seemed a little drawn out -- lots of carriage and gig and coach rides hither and yon.  The touchy social issues -- adultery and LGBTQ stuff -- were a surprise, and I admire Davis for taking these on.  From the 2 books I've read, I feel one of the most noteworthy thing about Davis's style is that her stories have a rustic, domestic quality with many homespun details.<br /><br />I confess I read Regency books to get away from controversy and to sink into a pleasant fantasy (""Should I wear the sprigged muslin or the silk moire?""), so this book did not provide me with that relaxing, dreamlike quality I often seek for bedtime reading.  While I thought these sensitive topics were well-managed, it did seem odd to read about ""verboten"" social issues in a book set in the early 1800s.  Davis is a bright and flexible author so I may go on to another of her books; just not sure.",3.0,0,2022
A Court of Honey and Ash - very disappointed; will NOT read the rest of this series,"I used to love Shannon Mayer. Never read Kelly before and will not try her as a solo author after reading this book. But the last books Shannon has written have more sexual innuendo, cussing, stupid/childish humor (farting). I suspect she is doing this for the reviews. And books like this get those reviews. (I want the old Shannon back!)<br />• Sexual thoughts used so often they were completely distracting to story and totally unnecessary; very immature, as if horny teen boy wrote rather than 2 women. (one character thinks: “yep, my brain went straight to the gutter”)<br />• Laughable dialogue: You murderous swine! (someone died; I, the reader, was not supposed to laugh)<br />• Laughable situations: man blown up in pieces while on water, and she was going to run down and find him. (“What was left of him was there and I had to find him.”) BTW, a hundred other people were blown up at same time. Wonder how she’d know which blown-up body part belong to him.<br />• Staring sexually at body parts; taking about body parts – used over and over and over. “Boobs and ass bouncing, she grabbed me in a damn bear hug” and “He kept trying to look further down her cleavage” and “Lugh’s left nut”<br />• The scene with the holey bathroom towel after her shower was immature and stupid!<br />• “I could have an orgasm right here” (spoken about a kitchen countertop no less! and in the presence of a man she just met)<br />• Endless, immature nonstop cussing! If you don’t like reading the F word over and over, skip this book. All the cussing contributed nothing to the story, which was already weak. Cussing is useless filler.<br />• Smoking pipe – what’s the point? Giving a character something to do so the authors can describe it?<br />• I did love the partnership Shannon had with KF Breene and if they write together again, I will buy. Breene is wonderful author.  And I used to love Shannon.",1.0,0,2022
What a great start to a new series!,"I have fallen head over heels for the Rosewood ladies. Lenora and Perth did not hit it off from the moment they met. Their banter back and forth kept me smiling and entertained me. When they became closer and Lenora broke down her icy demeanor exposing all her burdens to Perth, he felt it to his soul. He then realized how much she meant to him. Because her brother James who is the Earl, has not been heard from and feared lost to them, the next in line was their odious cousin. The cousin threatened Lenora with false claims and a judge in his pocket. She could not take it and screamed for him to pack up and leave the house party. But not before Perth giving him some well-deserved physical advice. Boy, it felt good to have the cousin out of sorts getting what he deserved. I look forward to the rest of the series for each of the sisters as well as discovering if indeed James comes home. An excellent read and I highly recommend.<br /><br />Reasons I enjoyed this book:<br />Entertaining<br />Funny<br />Happily Ever After<br />Page-turner<br />Romantic<br />Steamy<br />Witty<br />Wonderful characters",5.0,1,2022
Didn't want it to end,"It's not often I fall in love with a main character, but in this book I wanted to follow her around. I wanted to make her life right, be sure she was ok, laugh with her, discover life and science with her and most of all<br />cook with her.  The storyline is brilliant, the characters uniquely alive and distinctly odd and lovable.  This book surprised me with passion & laughter. And, I'm so thankful society has evolved from that time when they put women in aprons and muzzled their intelligence and their very souls.",5.0,1,2022
"Cast it still too large, but the plot moved forward well here","My main complaint with the Binding Words series is that Daniel Schinhofen has allowed the harem to grow far too large.  Sean not only has his 9 living and 2 dead wives, but all of the women he has hired to care for his home will eventually join his harem.  So we have another 9 women waiting in the wings to join him.  Daniel is a very talented author, but I don't think any author could give enough page time to this large of a cast, and that is without considering all of the other groups that require interactions.<br /><br />This definitely drains the tale of some of the magic.  Sean is a good character overall, but it seems that few of the other characters really get to stand out for long.  There are just so many characters in the tale and they all seem diminished by the lack of page time.<br /><br />But the plot here is very interesting.  Accord takes the slow moving puzzle of this world and advances the storyline.  We learn of the goals of Lord Truestrike, and of the reason the Tuatha made the agreement that left them cursed in the eyes of their former followers who ended up trapped in this world.  There are definite hints as to possible conclusions to the series now.<br /><br />I enjoy Daniel's writing.  He has a great imagination and puts enough details into his tales to make for compelling tales.  I'd say that his Aether's Rebirth and Luck's Voice series are stronger due to the smaller casts, but this is still an excellent series.  Start from book 1 to get a better understanding of the characters, but this is worth the read.",4.0,1,2022
pretentious and fails,I am unsure about how others enjoyed this book. It is dripping with pretentiousness on every single page. I do not understand classics sometimes because I cannot fathom how anyone can sit there and want to have a discourse on this book.

Deeply boring,"It’s been a long time since a book bored me as much as this one did.  It was page after page of the same scene.  She: “he’s gorgeous, I really like him, he’s pretty perfect, BUT…I can’t allow myself to get involved.” He: increasingly accommodating, attentive, and demonstrative of overt interest gets repeatedly shut down.  This monotonous interplay, sprinkled with unsophisticated dialogue became the literary equivalent of an annoying musical ear worm.<br /><br />While I am not a writer, I am a prodigious reader.

Suitable for university art majors,"The title is a misnomer based on the content, which is geared for an art major. Content would be appreciated as part of an introductory, 101 course.

Well-written Hunger Games fanfic,"All of Us Villains is extremely well-written Hunger Games fanfic. Take the Hunger Games, add magic, and make it between children in seven specific families and you have the premise of this book. A character even comments that someone else almost made him spill his drink on his pants. The story is told from the alternating viewpoints of four characters, three chosen as their family’s champion and one not. I got sucked into the story and then it just ended. There was no resolution whatsoever. It just got to a point and, boom, done. I wasted no time ordering the second book of the duology, but it still annoyed me a bit. I have no problem with series, but I do like for each book to wrap stuff up at least somewhat. This one answered one single question (who wrote A Tradition of Tragedy) and that’s it. Not satisfying at all. Other than that, I loved the book. I recommend this book to people who like magic set in the current day and enjoyed reading The Hunger Games. Just be aware that the two books really should just be one single book and expect to move on to the second book quickly to finish the story.",4.0,1,2022
Wok cooking is the rage this year and this may be the best book to buy if you want be a Wok star.,"# The Woks of Life Cookbook<br />I knew I wanted to purchase this cookbook immediately for 3 main reasons. First they were referenced in Kenji Lopez-Alt’s cookbook The Wok, and he has mentioned learning about wok cooking and techniques from the Woks of Life blog. Secondly, the recipes I have tried from the Woks of Life blog have been exceptionally flavorful as well as fast and easy to make. There is a no fuss/no nonsense style that actually helps me get a better result. I feel like the quality of the food I can make with their instruction is as good or better than the restaurants near me. And lastly the story of how the blog was created resonates with me. Sarah was having a hard time getting hired after college, and the parents said “if nobody else will hire you, hire yourself”, this is inspirational to me as I am currently trying to switch careers from scientist to food blogger. It is uplifting to see their success in being able to earn a living off of something they are passionate about. The family has unique ties to Chinese food. Bill’s family owned and operated a restaurant, and Judy (his wife) brought knowledge of Hubei/Shanghai foods to the table, and ultimately they spent time living in Beijing. So they have perspective on both regional native Chinese foods as well as the Americanized Cantonese versions, complete with the secrets that are passed around among professional cooks. Add to this their determined and industrious daughters that add both innovation and a very detailed documentation of how the food is prepared, being more in tune with needs of the learning cooks that read the blog and this book.  Pictured is their shrimp and broccoli recipe from the blog, will add more photos as I cook the recipes from the book. Second photo is tomato egg stir fry.<br /><br />Details:<br />Length: about 320 pages (kindle)<br /><br />Photos: most but not all recipes have a photo of the final result, there are approximately 5 photos included to supplement instruction of complex steps like shaping bao or cutting a whole chicken or lobster into parts. There are numerous added photos of the family. Photos are well done, but to my eye lack the flair of a professional photographer or food stylist.<br /><br />Video links are included to show in-depth techniques and other content that will be better suited to visual demonstration.<br /><br />Units: mostly customary (spoons, cups, ounces) with an occasional recipe that includes grams for some ingredients. The baking section (sweets) contains grams for all ingredients measured by weight in addition to the customary ounces or cups. Ratios are not provided for scaling baked goods.<br /><br />Recipe names: in Chinese characters, phonetic script, and full English translaiton. Example 核桃虾, hétáo xiā, Walnut Shrimp<br /><br />Nutritional information: no nutritional information, allergen warnings, or dietary restriction notices are included in these recipes, although their blog does include nutritional information for recipes that are included there.<br /><br />The book is roughly 320 pages with material containing a primer on cooking tools, essential pantry ingredients, and techniques you need to know. The recipes are in a mix of customary and metric (in my US purchased kindle version), with most recipes using cups, spoons and ounces but occasionally grams make an appearance. Most but not all recipes include photos of the final dish, and there are a few illustrations or photos documenting how to do techniques. Several photos are of the family behind the blog. The book is roughly divided as follows:<br />Dim Sum (9 recipes), Starters (13 recipes), Noodles (10 recipes), Rice (8 recipes), Poultry and eggs (12 recipes), Pork, beef and lamb ( 13 recipes 6/5/3), Fish and shellfish (8 recipes), Vegetables and tofu (10 recipes), Soups and stocks (8 recipes), Sauces (5 recipes), Desserts and sweets (7 Recipes) for a total of 103 recipes.  See below for complete list.<br /><br />How does this compare to the blog? The blog offers nutritional information for all recipes, allows you to switch between metric and customary units, has a scalable serving size, and the blog has extensive step by step photos, and more detailed instruction, so all and all the blog is the better way to get their recipes for any recipes appearing in both places.  It also seems like the ingredient lists on the blog are written out with more consideration to grouping things as you use them. Conversely if you want more concise recipes with less repetition (the blog tends to include the steps of the recipe in the main blog article as well as in the recipe section, with the article version being very detailed). Also the ads on the blog can be intrusive and difficult to close on my iPad so the money spent on the book at least gives a respite from that frustration.<br /><br />Recipes included:<br />1. Pork and shrimp Siu mai<br />2. Mini char siu bao<br />3. Hong Kong egg tarts (Dan tat)<br />4. Garlic Chive and shrimp dumplings<br />5. Lo Bak Go Radish cake<br />6. Taro Puffs (wu gok)<br />7.

I was today years old when I discovered my kink,"I love, love the Different Hearts series. But I will admit I was a wee bit apprehensive about reading this book. First was the warning about light humiliation play, that’s usually a hard no for me. Then there was the brothers thing, I may have been a tad squicked at the thought. And I’ve never been comfortable with MMM.<br />So I sat down and reread the entire series. I remembered being hesitant about the S&M book which I ended up loving. I placed my trust in the author and started reading Waiting For Derek.<br />Hooo boy am I glad I did. First off there was zero humiliation that I could spot. Secondly it was the way Derek was written that had me falling in love with all three of these men. He was so accepting. He was so open about his self discovery process. And he gave zero sharts about what other people may think.<br />My potential squick about brothers? Blasted to smithereens. I am now alllll about the brother kink. Kyle and Kane were perfection. There was no awkwardness, they were not sexual with each other at all. They both focused 100% on Derek. Sign me up.<br />I continue to be astonished at how the author can write about potentially off-putting subjects in such a natural, normalizing, and loving manner. I will never doubt again. (Except scat play, there is NO way that will ever be sexy to me. No kink shaming. Just my hard limit. Blech. Please no. Why the heck did that just pop into my mind?

not really better...,"Again I am confused how I feel about this book.<br /><br />I am well aware that I will not know all of the secrets and some things will remain a mystery until the series is concluded.<br />That said... it is EXTREMELY frustrating to have important answers just dropped in a conversation. It is a topic everyone has wondered about at one time or another with the whole ""this is something we need to discuss"" and all of a sudden everyone knows the answer.

And although it seemed interesting, I've never tried it because mate stealing between sisters has always been unpalatable for me.<br />Today I decided to try it, but first I read reviews.

Not always, but enough to know I don't spoil the story for myself no matter how much I read.)<br /><br />Today I did that. I got the book and flipped to the epilogue.

Slow burn Murder Mystery,"Greenwich Park is a slow-paced and methodical mystery, with a dual timeline and multiple narrators. Helen is a woman desperate to get pregnant and married to Daniel, her brother’s friend from college. Rory has inherited the Haverstock company but doesn’t have the knowledge to run it well so he enlists the help of Daniel, hiring him as a partner. Rory is married to Serena, a gorgeous woman who got pregnant easily. When the book opens, Helen is pregnant and meets a young woman named Rachel at her prenatal class. Rachel is a mystery all by herself, with a lot of secrets that are slowly unraveled. In fact, the mystery itself is methodically unwound like a ball of twine until you get to the core where all of the secrets and deception are hidden. The narrators include Helen and Serena, both of whom see things differently and who lay out subtle clues, most of which I missed. I did figure out the real villain of the story, but the ending was a total unexpected surprise, so that was a good bonus to reading the book. I cannot say that the suspense was riveting but it held my attention enough for me to stick to reading the book daily until I finished it.

Loved This,"I swear this felt like catching up with friends. I’ve seen them described as sweet and nasty on socials and I think that is absolutely the perfect description. I absolutely love the way Acyn loves Harlow and the way he handles her and the people who try to come for her, it is so incredibly sexy. This was so fun, and sweet, and freaky.

Wonderful prequel,"This is a prequel to a new series. It follows teens Mia and Brax, both foster children who have had less than stellar experiences in their home placements. They’ve been friends since the first day they met. On her eighteenth birthday, Mia finds herself in a compromising position with her foster father; Brax comes to her rescue. He takes her under his wing to protect her, and things progress from there.<br /><br />Another wonderful teaser from Kait Nolan. It’s short, but it packs a lot into the story, doing a good job of setting the scene for what will follow in the first book in the series.

Beginning of a new Slayer Series,"This book reads a lot like fan fiction. This isn't a *bad* thing; but I expected more from this author.  It's an easy read with familiar characters circling in the background. The new original characters are children/relatives of Willow, Vi and Oz and very much patterned on the beloved original Scoobies. Of course, there's a Big Bad who can't be killed.  In Every Generation reads like a Mary Sue at times.<br /><br />I think die-hard Buffy fans will be disappointed. But teen fans who aren't invested in Buffy will probably enjoy this.",3.0,0,2022

Lady Anne: What a freaking nightmare!!!!!!!,"I have never read a fan fiction book where Lady Anne was still alive and very much part of the story.  Also, Darcy having kids without Elizabeth being the mom was  hard to swallow. However, it made for a very interesting plot. Then there is Wickham!  A NICE GUY???  How do you swallow that?  Secretly I have always wanted to read or write a story where he is a nice guy. The whole time I am waiting for the axe to fall and Wickham had some deep-seated plan to get even with Darcy. Perhaps he did have an affair with Juliet I would not have put it past the Wickham we know. Perhaps ""Fitz"" was his son. I waited but nothing of the sort happened. He was a nice guy.  Miss Anne Debourgh also surprised me and it was a nice surprise however, I won't spoil it for others, gotta read the book!<br /><br />I could go on and on but it's just too good of a story to ruin it for you.  As to my Lady Anne comment, she was the one you had to watch out for. When the two sisters Lady Anne and Catherine got together boy what a dynamite pair, not to be confused with dynamic!!!  I sincerely enjoyed this book and I finished it in one sitting. I have never read any of Summer Hanford's books and I believe this is her first foray into Elizabeth and Darcy and it was very nicely done. Get it on Kindle it's the only format I believe.<br /><br />To: Summer - PLEASE write another one.  A book two perhaps where Lady Anne gets her just desserts!<br />Just a thought.<br /><br />Liz",5.0,1,2022
Unique features make this book worth reading,"There are scores of books available on clearing away clutter. Why would you want to read this one? It has all the right ideas on cleaning out stuff and organizing what remains, just like lots of other books. She has a ten day plan that gives you a quick win, perhaps not something unique, but encouraging. She also begins her work with suggesting we think about what we want our home to feel like. She offers more resources on her website as do others.<br /><br />There are a few aspects of this book I felt made it unique enough to read yet another book on the topic. Acheson writes from a Christian viewpoint. She reminds us we are stewards of what God has given us. That means we don't just automatically throw stuff away. That brings up another aspect of the book I like. When we decide what to do with what we no longer want, we are to consider others. Perhaps that business suit we no longer need is exactly what another does need for a crucial job interview. And another unique topic in this book is an exploration on why we accumulate stuff in the first place. Perhaps we fear we will not have enough of something we need later. Acheson encourages us to trust God, that He will supply our needs. She also recognizes different personality styles when it comes to organization and has specific suggestions for each of them.<br /><br />This book contains many practical ideas to keep our homes free of clutter and for a lifestyle of organization. It also contains some thoughtful sections touching on our spiritual responsibility and our personality style. If you are desiring a home that is one without the stress of clutter, this book is recommended.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",4.0,1,2022
Another brilliant Riley Thorn adventure!,"I don't know how she does it, but I swear every book in this series is nuttier, funnier and more entertaining than the last! Riley and Nick and the cast of characters with which they surround themselves makes for suspenseful romantic comedy gold! Quirky characters, unimaginable situations, meddling neighbors with boundary issues, and banter galore make this one long, strange, fun trip!<br /><br />This story starts with Nick engrossed in the mystery of the disappearance of his former partner's sister, Beth. It's a mystery that has plagued NIck for 6 years, and ultimately led to him leaving the police force. Nick is so consumed with solving this mystery that he's left Riley craving his attention, so she decides to see if she can use her psychic powers to help move the case along. We all know what happens when Riley Thorn is on the case...it turns into shenanigans galore!<br /><br />Lucy Score's Riley Thorn books always entertain, so buckle up and dive in!",5.0,1,2022

"Very low 4 star, author tried too hard to be different.","I know that I complain quite often about authors that dip into tropes to write a tale.  I do have to applaud the fact that the author of Master of the Hoard worked hard to have races that did not come out of the handbook of standard fantasy races.<br /><br />However, at the same time, the author tries almost too hard to bring new races and monsters into the tale.  The story drags more than a bit as he had to spend quite a few pages describing the looks, appetites and habits of these unusual races and monsters.  It did not help the story remain strong.<br /><br />However, despite the problems with the races there are real characters in this tale.  The minions of our main character have personalities that stand out enough that you feel for them as they struggle against a world that is extremely hostile to them.<br /><br />This is an interesting tale.  I enjoyed seeing a new author take this and tread the new ground of having the main character be a former human now basically in charge of a dungeon, but without the ability to instantly create minions with magic, and him actually having a physical body that is clearly the boss monster of his dungeon area.<br /><br />This was not a perfect tale.  as my title says I give this a very low 4 star.  I think the new races the author created were a bit of a stretch on his skill and experience, but the story does hold together and held my interest.",4.0,1,2022

Perplexing . . .,"2.5 stars, didn’t love it but didn’t hate it, perplexing….  I wanted to love and really feel something deep and profound from this book.  The reviews and the hype were incorrect, IMHO.  There are some lovely moments and passages that try to get there but it just didn’t happen for me.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERTS<br />The whole premise felt “off” and absurd to me.  I’m over 70 and have already known too many people who were dying of cancer, old age or other maladies. Some include you in their final circle of family and friends, some don’t.  In Queenie’s case, Harold had little information to go on. If he had called the Hospice, they probably wouldn’t have given him too much information but certainly one of the nuns could have given him an idea of how Queenie was doing so he could make a smarter decision.  He was one long day’s drive away. Get in the car, take a bus or the train. But to set off walking close to 600 miles with no plan, no map, no clothes, etc., was just nuts.  But I just accepted the premise of the story and kept reading because I really wanted to love this book.<br /><br />I didn’t like the Pilgrims. It felt like “Forest Gump” with his groupies following him blindly back and forth across the USA.  Yes, Harold met some new and different people, but it all complicated his quest and, in my opinion, didn’t lend a lot to the basic plot.<br /><br />For all of the background story of Harold’s mother, father, aunties (women friends of his father), and the sad relationship with his son, I felt more could have been done to resolve those sad issues and give Harold some peace at the end of his journey.<br /><br />I didn’t understand why Queenie had to be so disfigured.  After all Harold went through, they really didn’t have much of a reunion.  On the other hand, if he’d arrived three months earlier, maybe she would have been more alert and they could have communicated in some way.  I didn’t feel like their issues were resolved.  I believe Queenie felt peace just seeing him at the end, but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />I loved travelling from the south, through England.  I even made a map on my iPad.  I loved seeing photos from the Map App showing the towns.  I met some interesting people, but no one that profound or moving.  I loved Maureen’s transformation and coming to terms with their shared grief.  I loved how she established a friendship with Rex and that helped her to evolve and deal with Harold’s “quest.”<br /><br />Reading the book wasn’t a waste of time, but I didn’t feel good at the end of the story.  I felt perplexed and kind of bamboozled.",3.0,0,2022

Brilliant Book,"Armored is so far ahead of others in this genre that I need to rethink the casual way I give five star ratings.  Each aspect of this book is done with immense skill: the characters are credible and confront their vulnerabilities.

I was particularly touched by this “mall cop” hero and his phenomenal wife - by the fierce love and commitment they showed each other. The author’s knowledge of drug cartels, mercenaries and weaponry is conveyed without pretense - the prose is clear and a joy to read.<br />This is a brilliant book. Well done.",5.0,1,2022
Far from up to Follett's usual standard,"The first time I wrote this review, in the Kindle App on my phone, which then closed the review and lost it, I rated this book a 2.  It lost a point for Kindle app doesn't work properly.  I have really had more than enough of Amazon doesn't care for one week.<br /><br />This book is WAY below Follet's usual standard of excellent writing, educational detail and high level of being interesting.  The Kingsbridge series are among my all time favorite books.  This book took until the book was 90% through to even become interesting.  By the end of the book the reader still wonders why Follett wrote it.  The book is not interesting in its own right, it adds nothing to the Kingsbridge series, and it doesn't even contain any characters nor recognizable ancestors of characters in the Kingsbridge novels.<br /><br />For the first 90 pages, the book is an endless and incredibly boring repetitious soap opera, boring even for a soap opera, interspersed with cycles of completely pointless violence.  There is absolutely no plot.  It's literally a very long working through of peoples' daily hum drum existence, day after day, punctuated with occasional violence that doesn't add to the story in any way.  The people themselves never found their lives as boring as I did reading about them day after day.  I skipped over large amounts of text and never missed anything.<br /><br />There was also something toward the end that really disturbed me.  I don't know if Follett thought a bit of jolly comeupance would make up for the deficiencies in the rest of the book?  But he has no morals when it comes to what's jolly comeupance.  The mean, greedy and cruel abbot develops ""Whores leprosy"", eg, syphillis, which neither was venereal or caused madness until the 15th century, and loses his mind.  The NEW abbott and the wronged woman together decide a good thing to do with him is lock him up in a hut where she was wrongly locked up.  But, the former abbott does not remember his past and has no idea where he is.  He is filthy and unkempt and gobbles greasy oatmeal and bacon with his hands.  There is no justice nor honor in getting revenge on a man in this condition!  Follett just lost my respect.",1.0,0,2022

Great learning experience,I'm happy Sabrina wrote this follow up as it made me rethink trayvon's  hideous murder again. She brought up points and situations I'd not known or understood from ten years ago and got me thinking about how very unchanged black lives have come to gain equality and respect. The world is not colour blind as it should be. Being black in America is disheartening and fearful in so many ways. I wish I was younger and healthier to help try to make a difference but all I can do is understand the true hypocrisy and hatred so many have toward black people and others of colour.

5 unequivocal stars!,"Scott Hershovitz is a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Michigan, a husband, and father of two inquisitive sons.<br /><br />In all honesty, philosophy has always seemed to me to be pretentious intellectualism which whenever encountered made my eyes glaze over and my brain disconnect. Who knew that it could be relevant, interesting, and even fun?<br /><br />So what attracted me to this book?  The picture on the cover reminded me, at some subliminal level, of one of my favorite Calvin and Hobbes cartoons. Shallow but true. And for the record, I think the subtitle is something of a misnomer; while Nasty, Brutish, and Short includes inspiring conversations with Hershovitz's sons, it goes much deeper than that. I don't think that you have to have children to enjoy it but it will help if you at least remember being one. The point is that all children are miniature philosophers trying to make sense of the world. Aren't we all? And it is certainly true that kids have something fresh to bring to conversations because they are more creative thinkers and tend to say what they think without fear of ridicule.<br /><br />The book is divided into three main sections:  Making Sense of Morality and Obligations, Making Sense of Ourselves, and Making Sense of the World.  Hershovitz explores what rights are and when we should override them, how should we respond to wrongdoing, what is power and authority (who has it and why). You'll consider tough questions about sex, identity and gender, race; debate the role of government, abortion, war, and the existence of God.<br />Along the way you'll encounter Hobbes, Aristotle, Plato, Kant, Pascal, Voltaire, Feinberg, and Einstein among others.<br /><br />Probably the thing I like best about Nasty, Brutish, and Short is that it doesn't offer easy answers but shows us that there are many ways to approach complicated questions. It challenges us to do the critical thinking required to find solutions to the most pressing issues of our times.<br /><br />Thank you to the publisher for an ARC.",5.0,1,2022

Not the usual Anne Tyler brilliance,"I have loved every single one of Anne Tyler's 20+ novels. I wanted to love this one, too. There are lots of glowing reviews here, but it just wasn't there for me. All her other books have had memorable, well developed characters; not for their big personalities or flamboyance, but for the small quirks and character traits that she so brilliantly describes in her beautiful writing. Not so with this book. The ordinary people are just ordinary people. What was missing is the distinctive character development she is known for. And the plot? It was just all over the place.  I won't remember a single thing about this book. Maybe a novelist only has so many great books in her.

Other half if book not coming for 9 months?! Is repeat of earlier works.,"I like this author despite her propensity to divide what is a single book into multiple installments. Sometimes a vastbook covers such a large period of time or has multiple plot lines that dividing the book into installments makes sense. In those instances a  9 month break between installments is reasonable as basically the author is writing multiple books which just have the same characters involved. That is not the case here. Basically the next installment is just the other half of this one.  There is absolutely no purpose served by splitting it. Add to that a wait of 9 months before the other part comes out and all I feel is aggravated, thus the 1 star rating for a book that would otherwise be a solid 3 or 4.<br />There are good reasons to have a series rather than a single book.....I mean who would read The Lord if the Rings if it was in a single volume?  It would be overwhelming. Length of pages is a clear factor favoring multiple installments.  Novels that cover a vast expanse of time or are multi generational are also frequently delivered in installments.  Science fiction novels are often presented in installments with trilogies being common.  Thiose authors may occasionally fall into the trap of presenting a book in this manner when it is not warranted.  I think that is what happened here. The author has gotten into the habit of splitting her books and has stopped questioning whether it is appropriate.  If the other half isn't written yet, then she should have waited until it was to release this part. A couple month wait in the circumstances here would be reasonable if she just has to present her books in installments. You can't artificially create the need for a series, the book by its nature either justifies it or not. This one doesn't and the split has totally made me not give a toot whether I read the next part or not.  I mean the book is so much like ones she has already written I could just reread one of those.",1.0,0,2022

Dark and Mysterious,"Content Warning: Death, Abuse, Murder<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is the setting of La Cachette, a very small town in Louisiana filled with people who have different psychic powers. I love seeing the cultures that thrive in Louisiana, from Creole to Cajun and everything else in the mix. The author immerses us in the language, food and the way of life in La Cachette. One year ten babies were born, they were known as the Summer Children. All of them, except Grey, it seems, has some powers whether it’s hearing spirits, or being an empath. But there are dark secrets in this murky town and it’s a race to uncovering them with a storm bearing down on them. When Grey’s best friend, and twin flame, Elora is lost and most likely dead, Grey needs closure to find out what happens but she uncovers a lot more than she was expecting.<br /><br />The tone of this book never loses its mysteriousness. I was immersed in the humidity and dark waters of La Cachette! I could only imagine living in a place where I’m running barefoot in the mud, and the humidity is nasty along with the mosquito bites. I already live on a tropical island and I thank God when there are trade winds blowing! But the setting is perfect for a story like this. I found the people with psychic abilities fascinating and once again, the setting of Louisiana is the prime place for a story like this.<br /><br />I had my suspicions of who could have killed Elora, and what one of the secrets could be and I was right. The secrets revealed are pretty shocking and uncomfortable – ooo those small town secrets! I thought it was funny how no matter how creepy the scenes are Grey kept going outside at night! lol…like what is she thinking?! I get she felt safe in her small town but with the rougarou (werewolf) stories and that Dempsey Fontenot creepy song and urban legend about him – I’d be freaking out going out in the dark, especially with gators around and snakes, plus maybe a killer on the loose.<br /><br />It seems like not a lot happens in the story though. Grey is trying to find out what happens to her best friend but the weeks go by with her not finding out much at all. You would think a town full of psychics and such would be helpful, even Grey’s powers as they manifest would have been helpful if she could understand it. But they don’t help a lick except for keeping town secrets apparently.<br /><br />Why you should read it:<br />*fantastic setting and atmosphere – felt like I was in La Cachette, Louisiana being eating up by mosquitos l<br />*the psychic abilities by most of the town was fascinating<br />*you like little towns with dark, dark secrets – creepy<br /><br />Why you might not want to read it:<br />*there is a lull in the middle of the story<br />*some uncomfortable topics, dark read<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed the setting in this one: Louisiana mud, rivers, getting around on boats, dark nights, fireflies, muddy feet and mosquitos, humidity, psychics, and a hurricane.

"I ❤ Harper, Landon, and Aria 🍬🍬🍬","An amazing read and final book in the Nanny Love Match series.  I love all the characters so much. Harper is tough, she takes care of her friends and family without hesitation. She is loyal and so caring. Landon is also loyal, and determined. The two are the perfect match. The kids are hilarious, as usual. The story will have your snickering and swooning from one sentence to the next. This book also introduced me to bon bons and they are my new favorite food!  I love this series and am sad to say goodbye, but I look forward to what Krista has planned for us next.  Great writing, awesome story! Top summer read!",5.0,1,2022

Always fascinating...,"Douglas Richards always introduces a dazzling array of plausible near future technology in each of his books.  Unfortunately when he has such an array of new tools at his fingertips, he still manages to paint himself into a plot corner.  In fairness, he has exposed all of the pieces that allow hime to build a bridge out of the corner, but it still takes some twists and turns as the main characters are trapped in a seemingly inescapable position.  Fortunately he is an excellent writer and in any other hands, getting his characters out of a bind would be an exercise in tedium.",5.0,1,2022
Disappointed,"The main reason I picked this book was because it was a ""Savannah book"".  I grew up in Savannah and lived there for 50 years so I was excited to read a book that takes place there. I was very disappointed in that respect.  Except for one reference to Habersham Street, Washington Park and the Colonial Cemetery, this could have been any city. Even the names of the hospitals were changed and from the descriptions, their locations. So if you want to read a book based in Savannah, this is not a book for you.<br /><br />The story line is interesting, though pretty far fetched and it does seem to go on and on at times. I plan to give the next book in the series a try and hope it's better. I also hope I can recognize the beautiful city I grew up in!",3.0,0,2022
"First rate archaeo-science, humanist social interpretation to the age of faith","Alice Roberts' Buried: An alternative history of the first millennium in Britain' is technically brilliant. Her story of unrelenting attachment to solving ancient burial mysteries is a superb, coherent narrative. The tomb site chapter-style storytelling is worth the time.<br /><br />Roberts repetitive weakness (IMHO) is extrapolating a Roman/Dark Age/Medieval cultural interpretation from burial and anatomical evidence by applying a 21st-century Humanist worldview. The problematic histories of Bede and others seldom reflect the mind's eye of the temporal inhabitants. However, Beowulf in its OE context influences Dark Age and Medieval OE/ME context, as did Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chaucer, Dante, Boccaccio, and the far more extant fragments of village-oriented poetry/storytelling. A modern, self-described Humanist, Roberts is out of context, attempting to impute humanism to an age before the invention.<br /><br />In an early example, she questions the interpretation regarding why 1/3 of the heads of the dead are cut off. Sounds shocking. But, it isn't. In the context of the period, the headless corpse is an Occam's Razor from the era's worldview. Ghosts and spirits were not a matter of opinion. Ghosts and haunting spirits were expert facts. The Bible tells of the supernatural. The authorities of kings and religion agreed. To not agree, was heresy.<br /><br />The dead likely agreed in life and likely participated in the village decapitation burial ritual. Removing dead heads, as frequently as it is observed, is easily understood as a community service to the departed to ensure they don't return, as they surely were seen to do, to haunt family and village. Did disemboweled Egyptian mummies represent anything different? Headless burial meant no ghosts. Gutless mummies represent a trip to Duat sans haunting spirits. Is it a wonder that the buried might later be dug up, staked, bricked, or cremated years later as the period literature describes?<br /><br />Medieval literature in all surviving texts presents a belief in an extracorporeal human spirit and afterlife within both the Christian and Pagan traditions. There is no evidence from the period of a humanist worldview. Roberts suggests a Hellenistic philosophical tradition using Epicureans to deduce a classical knowledge transference into North Sea paganism, Britonic paganism allowed by Romans (not so much the Druids themselves), and later Roman Xtianity. Several of the graveyards she investigates began as a cult of dead saints. People wanted to draw near the saints in death and were buried in proximity for medieval-minded reasons.<br /><br />The first historical evidence suggesting a non-haunted British world is expressed in the mid-16th century as Enlightenment began to question the supernatural and evil spirits.<br /><br />The study of language, runes to Old English, and the body of poetic literature from the era reflect a human thought paradigm utterly foreign to 19-20th century. These are the graves of people holding a worldview we might likely never comprehend.<br /><br />I was reminded in several passages of 'reading list' supplement. My list would include the academic work of CS Lewis in 'The Discarded Image'. Hana Videen's ""The Wordhord: Daily Life in Old English"" for a sense of word images and 'The Edge of the World: A Cultural History of the North Sea and the Transformation of Europe' by Michael Pye to consider a 10,000-year trading lingua franca.",4.0,1,2022
"Always so much fun, and this series has the cutest book covers! Love these old friends/characters!","I always end up laughing when I read a book in this series. Between the book club ladies and that little scamp Streetman, I'm always giggling at something! I can just picture Phee running around like she's putting out fires first with the ladies, then her mom, and having to deal with Streetman's just the icing on the cake, well for comedy reasons, not for Phee's sanity, lol.<br /><br />I wasn't sure how horse thefts and the murder at hand connected, but I was pretty sure I was gonna find out because these authors are great at tying up loose ends and making things connect just right. I loved how Streetman got to play a pretty important part in one section of the takedown. He's such a stinker but it's good he's like that sometimes! I hadn't guessed the killer either. Ann and Jim are always good for a great surprise.<br /><br />I know the series switched publishers, but I'm so happy the covers remained fairly the same. While the art looks a touch different, it's still captured the cuteness and rascally-ness of Streetman as well as the Arizona landscape. I literally can't wait until a future book with Phee's wedding, but I'm really more eager to see what Streetman does. I'm sure his picture on the cover's going to be awesome since Harriet's already got his outfit planned. If it was ever possible to feel like a second fiddle at your own wedding, I have a feeling Phee's gonna feel like that, lol. But it'll be such fun!<br /><br />I voluntarily read and reviewed an ARC of this book provided by Beyond the Page Publishing via NetGalley, and my opinions are my own.",5.0,1,2022
"A passionate, reunion romance with delightful moments of humor","Two years ago, Lucca Saracino lost his marriage of less than a year because an opportunistic, publicity-seeking topless model named Jasmine Bailey lied to the tabloids. She claimed that she and the gorgeous, young, Italian billionaire had shared a wild night of unbridled passion on his fabulous yacht. When Vivien, his pregnant wife, heard about the Bailey woman’s lies, she refused to trust his claim of innocence. Instead she chose to believe the libel, with the vicious encouragement of her older sister, Bernice, who had always hated Lucca.<br /><br />Vivien had other reasons for believing Lucca had cheated on her in addition to Bernice’s gut-wrenching reminder that Lucca was a womanizer before Vivien married him, and her insistence that he would always be a womanizer. No one on her side of the family or his had supported their marriage, because their personalities and lifestyles were worlds apart. When they met, Lucca was a 27-year-old, billionaire, workaholic, sophisticated, international businessman who had already had a string of gorgeous, high-profile models and actresses as his temporary lovers. Vivien was a 24-year-old, sheltered, naïve, virginal professor of botany, who had rarely even been on a date. They met through Lucca’s younger sister, Sarafina, who was a student in one of Vivien’s classes, on a day when Lucca came to visit his sister on the campus where Vivien taught. From the moment Lucca met Vivien, he pursued her relentlessly. Vivien was massively attracted to him as well, but she was too conservative to allow herself to become just one more of his passing flings. Though Lucca did not tell Vivien he loved her when he proposed, she was so madly in love with him, she was unable to do anything but accept. Unfortunately, after they married, Lucca did not cut back on his horrendous work schedule whatsoever, and Vivien hardly saw him. It became harder and harder for her to believe that he hadn’t come to regret the marriage, and his response to the announcement that she had fallen pregnant was anything but pleased. All of these issues taken together made the idea of Lucca’s cheating seem completely plausible to Vivien.<br /><br />Vivien moved out, refused to accept any financial support from Lucca, and took a part-time job as a botany professor. She has been living in a small cottage near the university with Bernice, her adorable toddler son, Marco, who is the image of Lucca, and her tiny, three-legged, rescue terrier, Jock. During the past two years, she has not seen Lucca, the two of them only communicating through their lawyers. She has also rarely allowed Lucca to see his son, because she can hardly bear to be apart from him. Marco has always been picked up at Vivien’s house by a nanny that Lucca hired. In spite of all this, Vivien is shocked when, at the very moment that the two years of separation has ended before divorce proceedings can legally begin, Lucca instantly files for divorce.<br /><br />As the story opens, the Saracino divorce is days away from being final when Lucca comes across a story in the same gutter press that ruined his marriage, in which, at long last, Jasmine Bailey has retracted her lies about him. When he shows the story to Alfredo, one of his Saracino cousins who works as his assistant, he is angered to discover for the first time that even his own family had believed the Bailey story and thought he had cheated on his wife. And, Alfredo assures him, none of them blamed him because none of them thought Vivien was good enough for him. Lucca sharply reprimands Alfredo for disrespecting the mother of his child, but he feels no anger at his family’s lack of faith in his ability to be a loyal husband. That is definitely not his attitude toward his soon-to-be ex-wife. He is extremely bitter toward Vivien for having no faith in him. As far as he is concerned, she threw away him and their marriage, and she has caused him to be practically a stranger to his beloved baby son. He has his secretary obtain a pristine new copy of the relevant newspaper and deliver it to Vivien by special messenger with a gift card bearing his name.<br /><br />When Vivien reads the article, she is devastated to realize how unjust she has been to Lucca, and is desperate to see him immediately, apologize profusely, and declare to him that she is willing to do anything she can to salvage their marriage.<br /><br />As always with LG, this story is full of a great deal of emotional intensity and sexual passion, which makes for a compelling read. And, in addition to all of that, there are a number of delightfully humorous moments sprinkled throughout this story, when Vivien and Lucca are on stage together with Jock the dog and baby Marco.<br /><br />Though this novel was originally published almost two decades ago, and technology has changed quite a bit since then, nevertheless, this romance has aged well and does not feel dated at all.<br /><br />My only complaint about this novel is that I wish Vivien had had a growth arc in her relationship to “Mean Girl” Bernice, who is blatantly verbally abusive to Vivien throughout this whole book. Rather than Vivien’s constantly making excuses for Bernice’s inexcusable behavior, I really wanted her to stand up to Bernice and set some much needed boundaries. Kindness and compassion do not require being a doormat. Bernice desperately needed a judicious application of “tough love,” and she did not remotely earn the happy ending she got.<br /><br />I have read this book multiple times over the years, originally purchasing it in mass market paperback format and repurchasing it in Kindle format. It is definitely a keeper.<br /><br />I rate this novel as follows:<br /><br />Heroine: 5 stars<br />Hero: 5 stars<br />Romance Plot: 5 stars<br />Baby Marco: 5 stars<br />Jock the dog: 5 stars<br />Abusive Bernice: 2 stars<br />Writing: 5 stars<br />Overall: 5 stars",5.0,1,2022

"Not bad, not great","I wouldn’t exactly call this a ‘thrilling’ historical romance novel, but it was a bit better than many I’ve read.  There were some elements I liked and some that I really didn’t.  I seldom give romances three stars as I really like the book or I really don’t and then give them the associated rating. This one, for me was neither terrible or wonderful.<br /><br />What I liked: a different kind of hero.  Yes, he’s handsome, virile, and reasonably wealthy, but he is also not wholly English.  He is from a presumed Middle Eastern country, the mythical Oran. His mother is English but she was part of a harem as one of the Sultan’s many wives. After the death of the Sultan and internal conflict with his half-brother over control of the Sultanate, Gabriel and his mother flee to London to take up a new life.  Bottom line, I have no argument with the framing and development of Gabriel’s character and give kudos to the author for developing an atypical character with a few of his native cultural characteristics in tact.<br /><br />What I disliked: the female protagonist who grated on my nerves.  Drusilla’s background is not as well developed, so there is little to point to to support her very annoying habit of doing things to sabotage her relationship with Gabriel in spite of the fact that she has been ‘in love’ with him for nearly 5 years.  Caustic comments, outward disdain, and standoffish behavior rule their interactions through the first third of the novel. Of course, the author offers up an explanation for her behavior but, in my estimation, it didn’t seem sufficient to warrant her relentlessly off-putting behavior and poor decision-making.<br /><br />Of course, both characters have a professed reluctance to marry but the author employs the oft-used ‘caught embracing, so we are forced to marry’ trope to get them together. There are a few marginally developed side characters with Eva, Drusilla’s friend, being the most fleshed-out.  There’s a reason for that: she will be the star of the next novel in the series as was made obvious by the lead-in ending to this novel. Finally, there is a satisfying, if somewhat melodramatic, HEA.<br /><br />So, will I read the next book in the series, the beautiful, head-strong Eva’s story? Since it’s available through KU probably.  If I had to pay for it, probably not.",3.0,0,2022

Glaring holes in the plot,"Unger is an excellent writer, but I found this book to really miss the mark. A lot of going back and forth between past and present and not very well done. And probably the biggest problem for me was the shoddy editing. Below are two areas that made absolutely no sense - spoiler alert if you haven't read it.<br /><br />First spoiler alert - the crazy stalker, her ""love"" Adam is worth a lot of money.....yet he conveniently leaves a trail for her and the detective to find him. Seriously - it made ABSOLUTELY no sense to me that he would stay in an apartment rental and stiff the elderly man he rented from. Adam is rich, yet he pays for the first week, then a partial payment and them skips town, not paying the balance and leaving a few items behind.....which includes an article about Wren's early life.<br /><br />And the next glaring hole has to do with Wren somehow discovering that she had a tracking device on her car and it ends up on a Mustang. Next scene she's in a car accident, leaves her vehicle, phone and gun and walks to Adam. Again- glaring hole, makes no sense. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this book - and highly recommend the author have more readers help in the reading of her work - after the second glaring hole in the story I started skimming. Strongly recommend a new editing team that helps the author parse out what she is trying to tell us. A lot of competing themes and very difficult to stay focused and continue reading.",1.0,0,2022
The best book on how to make software testable,"I have been doing unit and integration testing for about fifteen years, and I have read many books about testing using different languages. This book so far is the best. Most of the books gave simple examples like calculators or dependency injection. This book covered where and how to use each and design your code to be testable. That is very important since testable code requires a different structure or architecture. This book also covers dealing with mock, databases, external services.

Great book!!,"I love a great read, a book that relentlessly pulls me along with action and adventure, mysteries and plot twists, good characters.  Douglas E. Richards is great at this and I can always count on him for a great read.  But the really special books do something extra, and this is one of those books.  One of my favorite ways to add that extra something is when an author researches an area and bases part of the story on true information, thus educating me and entertaining me at the same time.<br /><br />But this book is about UFOs…  Well, if you’ve an interest in UFOs you should definitely read this book.  And if you don’t believe in UFOs, then you NEED to read this book.  I was FLOORED when I dug further and found the degree of confirmable information that is available right now.

Her family life was not so unusual,"Many rural people of that era did not have indoor plumbing until the 1950s and 60s. Many families lost children to stillbirth, illness, and other conditions.  “Nervous breakdowns” were not unheard of. The author tries to take common difficulties of life and turn them into something unusual for a book. She wasn’t “cheated” out of a house. Both her father and his sister received a life estate to the house. Her father did not choose to use it, while his sister did. I tired of hearing about the author’s successes in life, the fancy jobs and houses she bought. I tired of her complaints against her ex-husband who doubtless had his own side of the story.

Convoluted,I got this book free on a Prime monthly pick. Glad I didn’t pay for it. The main character is unlikeable and stays completely flat through the whole thing. The whole book feels like a series of events that don’t contribute at all to what is supposed to be the main story. There is a completely graphic and unnecessary scene in the middle. The ending is stilted and abrupt. It felt like the author got tired of her characters (and who could blame her? They’re all awful) and wrote a perfunctory ending just to be done.,2.0,0,2022

As hard as I tried, I couldn't sympathize with either David or Norah and Paul's angst didn't ring true for me.  Also, you never really get to know the characters.

Continuity issues KILLED THE STORY,"First of  I loved the story by TL Swan, but per usual Montlake hires lackluster editors that can’t keep a timeline straight to save their jobs. But I have come to the conclusion Montlake doesn’t care about the quality of the book they release, or their authors. Yes the book has a lot of reviews more than a lot of NY Time best sellers, therefore someone should have pointed out the errors.<br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br />Emily the heroine of the book, meets a character named Claudia, but doesn’t know who the woman is on the street and has to be told. Geez I feel for Emily and her early dementia.<br />Second a major plot of the book is about news stories being stolen by the competition. Hmmmm….all of a sudden I’m listening and Hayden has been fired for stealing from Miles Media. HUH!!! When did this happen? So I go to the book text and nothing about them proving it was Hayden.<br />Third major time line errors, too numerous to mention. It was as if the editor couldn’t be bothered to check the manuscript. It isn’t Swan’s fault her editor can’t edit.<br />Fourth plot point is the character Lara, she is fired via phone call early on. In the call the character of Tristan, the reader is told he is aware of the firing. But then Tristan later on has to ask HR who she is? I know it’s a multi national company but since Tristan took care of the money; would he not be aware of the employees.<br />To most readers little things like these don’t matter, but I EXPECT; when a publisher edits a book for it to be a clean copy. If this was an Indie published book I would overlook these errors; but I won’t from a book that was edited by a book seller who masquerades as a publishing house. TL Swan wrote a solid book and has been let down by her mediocre editor.",3.0,0,2022

A perverted retelling of Snow White,"Absolutely gross and vile. Six year-old Snow White kills her father by sucking the blood out of his penis, it's suggested she has sex with a monk when she's 12 while killing him, and the prince is a necrophiliac. If I'm a prude for not liking this and finding it perverse, I'll happily take that title.",1.0,0,2022
Creative World Building,"Content Warning: Death, Violence<br /><br />This book was a pleasant surprise! I was drawn to the cover – because look at it, it looks amazing. And then I heard some good reviews about it so when I saw the ebook on sale on Amazon, I had to get it.<br /><br />There are a few characters in this story, but the main ones for me are Lin and Jovis. Lin is the Emperor’s daughter and we learn her father is pitting her against his foster-son Bayan, to see who would be his rightful heir. Thing is the Emperor has an obsession. He makes constructs. These are creatures that are made, different animal parts put together to make a new creature. The construct is powered by a human part though – a bone shard taken from children. The Emperor claims these constructs are needed to keep the empire in order, but Lin knows something is wrong. I found the story about constructs so fascinating and so creative!<br /><br />Outside of the palace, there is Jovis – a smuggler who is trying to pay down his debts and who has his own obsession – with a woman he loves and who went missing years ago. Since she has been gone he has been following clues to find her. I love his personality. He kind of reminded me of Aladdin (in the Disney movie lol) and he found a pet companion named Mephi. I loved their bond. Jovis definitely is that character that keeps the story moving and he gives us a tour of this world the story is set in. He travels to different islands and encounter the people that live so through him we get a lot of the setting.<br /><br />The romance is between Phalue and Ramani. Phalue is a governor’s daughter, Ramani is a commoner and a rebel. They love one another but Ramani is trying to make Phalue see the plight of the people around them. I’m glad someone had a happy ending in this book because Jovis missing his love, Lin wanting her father’s love…it was tough for a lot of the characters.<br /><br />Now this story is dark because the bone shards they use for the constructs come from children. There is a ceremony where a child’s shard is taken. The Emperor is like a mad scientist, he’s creating creatures and he doesn’t care about anything else. There are a few reveals in the end which sets up the sequel.<br /><br />There are some questions I still have about the constructs – because it’s not futuristic, the constructs have instructions written on their shards. And how is it the Emperor is the only one who repairs this many constructs around the empire? There are a bunch of islands in this empire…so I just had a few questions. Maybe there will be more answers in book two?<br /><br />Why you should read it:<br />*original and creative story about constructs and bone shards<br />*great world building and lots of action, especially if Jovis was telling his side of the story<br />*LGBTQ+ romance rep<br />*bond between Jovis and Mephi (love Mephi)<br /><br />Why you might not want to read it:<br />*not into high fantasy<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />This story has a lot going on but I thought the author did a good job balancing it all. There are multiple POVs, romance, action, plot twists and detailed world building. I was intrigued with the constructs, and the characters. It’s an entertaining story and I’m eager to read book two to see what happens next!",4.0,1,2022
too many coincidences,"I was happy to see the end of this book, because I was quite frustrated reading it.  The premise is based on too many coincidences to start with, and then some type of unexplained ""magic"" (the only way to describe it) at the end.  SPOILER ALERT - How did Leo suddenly know where Morgan lived, and how did he get there before her when he was chasing her through the park before she escaped? Also, this book had a bunch of typos/misspellings or just wrong word usage/choices - ""taught"" when the sentence should have read ""taut.""

WOW! What a ride I wasn’t expecting!,"This author is new-to-me, but I picked up this book because I saw a few people raving about it and how good it was. I kinda went in blind, meaning I didn’t read the blurb right before diving in (I had read it a week or so before I grabbed it, but didn’t remember what it was going to be about). I also stayed away from reading any kinds of reviews so I didn’t come across any spoilers. And I’m glad I did. I wouldn’t have wanted to know what this book was about because I probably wouldn’t have had the shock factor that I did. This book was definitely a page turner. It kept my interest from the beginning & I couldn’t wait to read more when I had the time to read. I almost brought my kindle out at a birthday party, but I refrained. LOL!  It started out with a letter, a pen pal so to speak, from a penitentiary. That’s all I’m going to hint about because it’s in the blurb. This book had a heck of a lotta steam, but it was also a very intense book. Dark at times. It was 2:30am last night when the plot twist smacked me right in the face (and feels) and I was speechless. I couldn’t read fast enough, yet I didn’t want to miss anything. I needed to slow down, but I couldn’t. I was seriously blown away by what I just read. And then I couldn’t fall asleep. Thank goodness for energy drinks. LOL!  J.T has a very crazy imagination but after reading the acknowledgment at the end, I kind of understood where her words came from. Still, she expanded her imagination to somewhere I could’ve never thought in a million years. I’ve honestly only read one book that blew me away like this one did, and that was Verity by Colleen Hoover. I’m absolutely going to check out J.T’s other books because she’s a fantastic author!",5.0,1,2022
My tattle-tail loved it!,"I saw this book come out in perfect timing and I got so excited I started to read it out-loud immediately. My tattling child popped his head into the room to listen without really wanting to show me he was listening. By the end of the story he confessed that he not only listened but he also enjoyed it. Thayer that day when he came to tattle on his brother i simply asked him “are you tattling or telling?” And i kid you not. My child stopped himself! He hung his head and said, “I’m tattling.” Then he apologized and walked away. My heart is happy. Thank you for this book!!!",5.0,1,2022
Good story. Too many holes,"I’ll admit. I’m not an attorney in Montana. But I am an attorney. And there were too many legal holes for this story to be plausible. And a few environmental holes. Stop reading if you don’t want spoilers.<br /><br />First off marriage records are public record and are recorded in courthouses in the clerks office. If you can’t find yours, you go there to get a copy. Second off, states can’t just take your property from you - even IF you may not be the legal heir you have more time to prove if you’re the heir and if you aren’t, they will look beyond the immediate family for an heir. They won’t just take your property. And finally methane is found in mines. In coal mines. The mine in this story is not a coal mine.<br /><br />The general story was fine. Good even. But the attempt to twist the legal world to fit what the author wanted to do was too much.",2.0,0,2022
"Mediocre curation -- some excellent stories, some poor ones","I wasn't that impressed with this collection. There are some gems, certainly, and ""The Cold Calculations"" would be outstanding in any collection, but a great many of them just didn't have much going on. I'm the kind of reader who is interested in who did what, why, and what happened. Give me interesting people doing interesting things and I'm happy. I don't need flowery prose. This is a collection where either the prose is outstanding, bordering on poetry, or the worldbuilding is exceptional, but it's either trite plots we've seen millions of times, or it's nearly devoid of plot. ""10 Steps to a Whole New You"" offers nothing by way of interesting characters, or anyone doing anything interesting really. But the writing style is pure art. If you want an outstanding turn of phrase, you'll love it.<br /><br />I don't feel all of them entirely fit the genre, or at least that they are truly representational of the genre. To me, romance has as the driving element two characters falling in love. If they do that on an alien planet, it's not science fiction, it's romance. A mystery has as the driving element someone gathering clues to solve a crime. If the crime is the murder of the dragon dung shoveler, it's not fantasy, it's a mystery. Science fiction has, as the driving element, something that is possible but not yet real. ""Broad Duddy Water"" is definitely science fiction. Fantasy has, as its driving element, something magical and impossible. ""The Red Mother"" is definitely fantasy. Some of these contain elements of science fiction or fantasy, but the driving element fits neither. ""I Was a Teenage Space Jockey"" has, as the driving element, a boy making peace with his elder brother escaping their abusive household. Which is that? Science fiction or fantasy? I'd argue neither. It is literary fiction with a trapping of fantasy. While some are excellent and would belong in The Best American Short Storis collection, and I'd argue that's a good place for IWaTSJ, I'm not sure they belong in this genre's collection. They are almost all heavy-handed political stories, which would not normally be an issue, but it seems here genre was sacrificed for message as was quality of story-telling.<br /><br />I rated each story individually, and my rating of the book is the simple average.<br /><br />10 Steps to a Whole New You -- At the core, this is the story of someone bit by a vampire, with about as much structure and substance as might be composed by an average fifth grader. The use of dialect that reads false and artistic flourishes attempts, and in my opinion fails, to save this piece from banality. It was the weakest of the collection. (1 star)<br /><br />The Pizza Boy -- This is a side adventure in a sprawling interplanetary rebellion. I liked it, drilling into the detail of the small instances of a bit player in a larger story.  (4 stars)<br /><br />If Martians Have Magic -- A university professor needs to save a group of civilians from the cruelty, hate, and viciousness of a war-ravaged victor. Both sides make so much sense, this story packs a lot of power into a short piece. (5 stars)<br /><br />Delete Your First Memory for Free -- A reversal of the Phillip K Dick Story, ""We Can Remember it For You Wholesale"". This explores how our memories, even the minor yet unpleasant ones, can shape us. (5 stars)<br /><br />The Red Mother -- Just a Viking Mage delivering a message. I had an irrational love of this because Elizabeth Bear seems to honestly know how to spin yarn on a drop spindle.  (5 stars)<br /><br />The Cold Calculations -- The most powerful of the bunch. What if the situations beyond our control aren't? What is the price of a human life, and who gets to set it? (5 stars)<br /><br />The Captain and the Quartermaster -- This was a basic tale of the workings of an army between the fights. It is told out of order, and the characters are charming, but there is little new to be found here. (2 stars)<br /><br />Broad Dutty Water: A Sunken Story -- Much like the first story, more style than substance. Jacquee botches going home from a doctor's visit in a post-apocalyptic world. At least there's a talking pig. (1 star)<br /><br />I Was a Teenage Space Jockey -- Native American kids facing bullies and abusive households find solace in an old-style arcade. For fantasy, 1 star. For literary fiction 5 stars. I'm taking the average. (3 stars)<br /><br />Let All the Children Boogie -- This one seemed like it had so much promise, and then it ended on a whimper that not only left more questions than answers, but left the wrong questions, such as ""why?"" and ""who cares?"" It's the story of two kids who hear a mysterious voice on the radio and follow it to -- I won't spoil it. It's so good until the end. (3 stars)<br /><br />Skinder's Veil - This starts off as the story of a PhD student who clearly does not know what a library is and who lives with a horrible roommate. It takes a while to have a slight brush with fantasy, but it runs far more literary. By the time it gets near fantasy, things rapidly devolve to where the protagonist is doing things, not because they make sense, but because the plot calls for them. There is no recovering from that. (1 star)<br /><br />The Algorithm Will See You Now -- A psychiatrist works through her own issues while treating a patient. And there are computers. (1 star)<br /><br />The Cloud Lake Unicorn -- A woman has a baby. That's the only driving thing anyone acts on, so that's the entire plot. The rest is literary dressing. But it is such good literary dressing I have to elevate the rating from what the mere plot would deserve. (3 stars)<br /><br />Proof by Induction -- This was a finalist for this year's Hugo award. Failing professor does math with his dead father. The characters are cool though. (3 stars)<br /><br />Colors of the Immortal Palette -- An artist seeks immortality -- literally and figuratively -- and to find her place in a world where she is far from the default. This is a brilliant reimagining of the vampire lore and a powerful tour through the life of a fascinating character. (5 stars)<br /><br />The Future Library -- A combination romance and save the trees story set in a dystopian future. This feels structurally awkward. The character is more an observer than an agent. It was compelling at times more for the knee jerk reaction to climate change than the particulars of this story. The logic of the protagonist's actions fails any attempt at analysis. She wants to prove something false, by providing absolute evidence it is true. (1 star)<br /><br />L'Espirit de L'Escalier -- An adaptation of the Orpheus and Eurydice story in modern times. (4 stars)<br /><br />Tripping Through Time -- In a world where virii like Covid are the norm, a young woman takes a job as a waitress in an establishment that uses glimpses into history as a form of entertainment. I'm not honestly sure what the characters wanted, since they did so little to get it. (1 star)<br /><br />The Frankly Impossible Weight of Han -- This is metafiction, more about the technology at its center than the characters involved. Normally not my cup of tea, but it's incredibly well done. (5 stars)<br /><br />Root Rot -- This story starts not entirely horrible and it kind of devolves a bit. I think once they took a liter of blood from the protagonist, who hasn't eaten, and he just wanders along his way, it was nearly a book meets wall incident. I've given a pink on a half-empty stomach and nearly hit the floor. And then they put it back, so the why is bewildering, but the why of most of this story is bewildering. It is, at best, dystopia on Mars (1 star)",3.0,0,2022

Not a complete story in itself!!,"Was loving this book right up to the final page and the discovery that it was continued in the next book in the series.  I feel cheated when a story is incomplete.  Series can be built that finish a storyline yet leave an opening for the next plot.  I will never know the close for the main characters as I won't support authors who don't provide a complete story of clearly state that the plot is not resolved until the next book.  Nora Roberts does this well.  I wish this author did as I would have been a follower.<br /><br />If the lack of completion isn't an issue to you, it is a good wholesome read.  3 stars for me as I am left hanging.",3.0,0,2022
"Danger, intrigue, surprise, loyalty, truth, and sacrifice","Oath of Sacrifice, by Jane Henry, is the fourth novel in the series Deviant Doms, a Dark Mafia Romance which once again focuses on the Rossi family located in the Boston area on the East Coast. In Oath of Fidelity,  Elise Regazza returned to Boston to the Rossi’s Castle where she was kept as a “prisoner” until she married Tavi Rossi. Santo, an “adopted brother” into the Rossi family, was sent to Tuscany to investigate a mysterious death. In the process of his investigation, Santo’s loyalty was questioned since he did not come clean and divulge details with Romeo Rossi, the newly appointed Don. As a result, Santo was exiled to Tuscany to run the Rossi vineyard away from the family.<br /><br /> As Oath of Sacrifice begins, Santo is in Tuscany reflecting on his exile and how much he missed his “adopted” Rossi family, the only true family he had ever known. The Castle had been his “home” since he was ten years old and had been adopted by Narciso and his wife Tosca. Tavi arrives and shares some bad news with Santo: the Campanelles claimed that the Rossi family owed them several million dollars from an old deal made by their father Narciso years ago. Santo inquires what Romeo decided and Tavi tells Santo that he promised Rosa’s hand in marriage, but that she does not know her fate yet. Santo returns to the United States with Tavi because Romeo takes cousin Dario officially into their Brotherhood and needs all the brothers present for the Blood oath. Santo is thrilled to see his “family,” if only for a few days.  While the family celebrates and dines on authentic Italian cuisine cooked by Nonna and Toasca, later the Rossi boys go to their warehouse for a friendly game of cards when Troopers descend upon the place and arrest Romeo. Romeo orders Santo to stay in the United States as he will be needed here for the family.<br /><br /> As the Underboss, Tavi puts the Castle on lockdown as he takes over for Romeo who is in jail until his lawyer can get him released. Santo is secretly thrilled because he gets extra time to be with his Rossi family before he goes back to Tuscany. Several strange incidents began to happen on the Castle property: Santo’s sports car explodes, guard dogs are acting strange, a few shadowy strangers are seen on the property, etc. Everyone is on high alert. But throughout this tense time, there is slow, hot, secret “dance” simmering between Santo and Rosa. They are trying avoid their attraction, but like moths gravitating to the warmth of the light…they are pulled like a magnet. However, there is too much at stake. Rosa has been promised to wed Carmine Campanelle to settle the Rossi million dollars of “debt.” Rosa knows as the eldest Rossi woman, she is merely a pawn to her Mafia family.  Santo knows his time is limited in the United States because when Romeo is released from jail, he will be sent back to Tuscany. The Blood Oath that Santo took makes him family which means he can never have Rosa, or any Rossi sister, as his own.<br /><br /> Danger, intrigue, surprise, loyalty, truth, and sacrifice will arise. The strength of the Rossi family will be tested in many unexpected plot twists and Jane Henry will keep you spellbound until the very last page. Santo may have been “adopted” into the Rossi family, but one thing I know for sure--Santo clearly has stolen MY heart.<br />  ~~Kelly Wolf, PhD 3/17/2022",5.0,1,2022

Bit weird,"I have given this read-in-a-day story 4 stars because it held my attention from start to end. Unfortunately, part of the rationale to catch the culprit was bizarre and lost it a star.<br />The story centers on three themes: The leopard doesn't change its spots, history repeats itself, and hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.<br />While the tale is primarily told in the present tense where Grace catches her husband Dominic red-handed in flagrante with a woman two decades younger than him and metes out her own brand of justice, we are also told Grace's backstory of being let down by men important to her, and her subsequent reactions.<br />I did find the willingness of a mother and uncle to literally pimp out their daughter/niece to catch a suspected wrongdoer absurd.

It includes the Watchmen Sourcebook and two expansion modules, Watchmen: Watching the Watchmen, and Watchmen: Taking out the Trash. While these books certainly contain background material on the Watchmen characters, most aficionados do not consider it canonical.

SPOILERS,"Story started off fun and characters likeable.  Then I started to absolutely despise the female lead.  Her self hate started to work my nerves.  She needed to get help for her severe eating disorder.  it was insulting to have her eat donut/doughnuts and drink soda daily.  That was insulting to those of us that struggled with weight eating healthy.  This character had a death wish.<br /><br />The 6 months apart really got on my nerves.  Really! she really hated herself that she couldn't accept any good.<br /><br />The H still chasing her plus apologizing for things that really wasn't his fault irked me farther.<br /><br />I wanted him to tell her to simply kick rocks with open toe shoes.<br /><br />Then her body image issues were miraculously cured with pregnancy.  So after she gives birth<br />Then what?  Will she go back to the ""woe is me, I don't deserve anything"" mentality?<br /><br />It got better after those issues.

Overall it was an okay read.  Just typical of many writers to create angst that ruins the love story.  She wasn't a prize with her attitude for me.

Kids out of control and financial crash,"3 1/2 stars<br /><br />Graduation is approaching at New Falls High School in New Falls, New York.  The kids are eager to celebrate, so when they start to receive texts inviting them to a party at a house under construction along the river, they’re all too eager to partake.  Once there though, things quickly get out of hand.<br /><br />This was an okay read.  The writing was good, but I could never completely buy into the story, and I couldn’t sympathize with any of the characters.  It wasn’t their entitlement, but the fact that they all thought that they were the only ones that mattered.  No matter that there’s underage drinking, drug use, criminal property damage, and sexual assault, the parents were always convinced that their kids didn’t do any of it.  Worse, the ending left me wanting more explanation of how the party came about.  Who really planned it?  I’m pretty sure that the kid taking the fall for it wasn’t the one.  Too many questions were left unanswered for my taste.  While I could see the police wanting to close the case, I didn’t buy into just how brazen they were to blame kids from lower socio-economic families while letting all the wealthier kids off with a slap on the wrist.  Also, the way the district attorney went after his assistant DA without allowing for explanation or investigation of what happened with him seemed over the top.  Was he really that concerned that the ADA might take over his job?  Hardly likely.<br /><br />There are some secrets in this book. Some get answered, others do not.

Alpha-hole,"Where to start? If you’ve read Nikki Clarke’s wolf shifter series you will love the heck out of this. If you haven’t you should while you wait for the next book. I think Mills foray into PNR was a slam dunk. Enough lore to get the basics without drowning you in info. The pace was good. It was fated mated/insta love but I think she did a good job of giving the relationship some foundation. The writing is very conversational making it a quick and easy read. I personally consider it more steamy than spicy but good.<br /><br />*mini spoiler*<br />*<br />*<br />I can’t recall ever reading a shifter story with a dub-con claiming (that was from the mmc). Sure it was heat of the moment but it was still premeditated,so this is your content warning if you have strong feelings about consent.

Inaccurate stories,"Well written and interesting, but early in the book the author tell’s us Bo squatted 975lbs and the school record was 1,025lbs.  That’s flat our WRONG.

You can better info by researching for free,This book was a joke. Lots of lists and repeated lists for extremely low to no income. Many are things that don't actually pay you half the time. Mechanical Turk is one. She's teaching you to have a poverty mindset. Want to do an hour or so worth of work to hopefully be paid .75 cents? IF they decide to pay you at all.  Then this book is for you. How she really makes her income is off YouTube and these books that rip people off. I'm sorry for the harsh evaluation but it's an honest review.

"The Becoming - disappointed, bored","I loved book 1.  Yet I couldn't wait for this book to end so I could get back to the David Eddings series I'm reading.  For a ""dragon"" series, there is very little dragon story in this book - except the dragons fly riders around. I could ignore that even though I love dragon stories, but I couldn't ignore how the story slowed down.  Nothing happened.  Some of the peril/drama was sharing a vision of something happening somewhere else.  I liked the gay love story; I hated the brutal sex; and anytime Shana was in the story I hated it.  I started skipping scenes with Shana and the god. There were times the scenes or dialogue didn't make sense. I am surprised how little I liked this book.  The epilogue was dark and didn't make me want to read book 3, but I probably will.  Hopefully, book 3 will be more like book 1.  I'll wait for the library copy.  I did finish this book so I'm giving it 2 stars.",2.0,0,2022

One problem with falling into this kind of rut is that character development virtually ceases for the protagonists.<br /><br />Installment 12 barely moved from its original location.

Amazing Story,"This review is for both of the books in this series, The Clocktaur Wars, consisting of The Clockwork Boys and The Wonder Engine.<br /><br />First, I will agree with several others that this feels like one large book split in two parts.  With that said, it is worth every penny to read these books.<br /><br />T. Kingfisher (a pen name for Ursula Vernon) crushes it with this tale, and she took me on a journey that I will not soon forget.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything, but it is hard to contain my enthusiasm over these books!<br /><br />First, the characters are so well written and three dimensional, you feel as though you know them.  The author has an incredibly strong grasp on human interaction, and the hesitant thoughts and doubts we carry in our heads.  The main characters are flawed and broken in their own ways, and while they sometimes feel hopeless inside, they still have that tiny glimmer of hope that is inherent to the human condition.  Not all authors can successfully write a dark characters while showing their human side as well as T. Kingfisher does in these novels.<br /><br />There is humor, tragedy, and suspense throughout the tale, and the way they are presented is done so smoothly that the reader won't know its happening until you are in the middle of a laugh or brought to tears. There was a section in Clockwork Boys that had me laughing so hard in bed that my wife thought I had lost my mind.  Likewise, there was a scene in the Wonder Engine that touched me in the soul so deeply that it brought me to tears.  Oh, how I want to talk about that scene with someone, anyone! But, I said no spoilers, so I will have to hope you feel it as I did.<br /><br />There has to be a special mention of the banter between the characters; especially between the male leads.  The way they interact, insult, challenge and joke with each other is fantastic. As someone who works in an environment with a lot of alpha male coworkers, I can confirm that this is very accurate to how we interact (minus the trying to literally kill each other).  Then, when it's time to work, they set their differences aside and do the job.  I was very impressed that the author had such a stong grip on this male interaction; she was quite accurate.<br /><br />The world building is done very well.  It takes a back seat to the characters, and that is perfect. The characters do their things, and the world is formed behind them in a subtle, perfect manner.  It comes across as a natural way to have the reader fit into the world.  There are non-human creatures, and they are introduced as just another natural creature in the world, as though I were to add an elephant to the story.  The way demons and possession are introduced, as with any magic or items, such as the Wonder Engines, is just as natural as if someone were describing a car in our world.  The result is a world that feels natural and normal, even though it contains magic, demons, and fantastical creatures. This is aided by the inclusion of a scholarly character, who is excited about exploring the world and ancient items found there.<br /><br />Another special mention for the Gnoles.  T. Kingfisher's gnoles are well described: their look, their manner of speaking, and their society. They are wonderfully well written, and used in the perfect amount. Many authors who create such wonderful creatures and put so much effort into working out their society, would overuse them, making them part of every scene.  T. Kingfisher uses them to good effect: to help move the story along, without being bogged down.<br /><br />I could go on, and I really want to, because these books are fantastic and some of the best character writing I've seen in a while.  These books affected me so much, that I want to start a book club with the express intent to have some people to discuss these books with me. Alas, all I can do is write this review, and hartily recommend these books.<br /><br />If you're still reading, I will leave you with this: The Clocktaur Boys and The Wonder Engine are a pair of those books that are so good they kind of ruin other books for a while.  I tried jumping into a couple of other books right after, and neither of them could hold my attention for long.  I may have to visit some other books by T. Kingfisher to help with the transition.",5.0,1,2022
the first 10% of the book is a snore,"I have yet to find anything actionable in the first 10%. Past exploits are not anything to get a person from novice to master as the title suggests. I'm not sure how a rewrite would help this book considering the author is moving to a different publisher. OK, so there was the one line which hackers and internet stumblers should consider... there are laws that could imprison an ordinary user if even the most normal activities caused damage intentionally or not.",2.0,0,2022
Can we have a non-overpowered MC?,"This is another tale where the world ends, but a single character gets thrown back in time to the moment before the disaster starts.  In theory he'll be able to change the past and improve the future.<br /><br />In every variant of this basic plot start I've encountered the main character who gets sent back in time is over-powered and just unlikable.  And Blaise Corvin managed to make one of the least likable characters I could imagine.  Of course he compounded that by ""killing"" his own MC and turning him into a magical zombie ""with a soul"".<br /><br />The rest of the tale played to other elements I dislike.  The ""gang"" that is evil and killing every other survivors is a trope that I dislike for more reasons than I want to explain, and the execution of that plot thread in this book was poor at every level.  The addition of gods who don't really make sense, and who bent the plot around their own antics made this read more like ""Deus ex Author"" rather than an organic tale that moved with the characters and their growth (or lack thereof considering their survival rate.)<br /><br />Just everything that I dislike about this genre and very little I like, but its well written and someone who does like the plot threads that annoy me will probably praise this tale highly.  Sadly, I can only give it my normal 3 stars.  I did not love it.",3.0,0,2022
"So much potential, but bare bones","I have loved Ms. Roberts' books for so long. I always look forward to one, hoping it will be one of her good ones. But that is becoming rare. Her talent is obviously still there. This was a good idea for a story and the basic outline was fun, with some interesting characters and places. But it felt hollow or rushed. Like once he left Miranda the first time, it was just a series of vignettes . And not a lot of plot development. I enjoyed it but was left dissatisfied when compared to a really good Nora book. I don't know if she's pressured to crank them out too often, is burnt out or what.  I'm thankful to her for all the pleasure I've had in her books, and hope we get one of her great ones again someday.",3.0,0,2022
"A fun, stand-out read","This enjoyable read has a lot going on, all of which I very much enjoyed: a sweetheart of a leading man who falls fast and hard, a tough leading gal whose trust in people needs to be rebuilt (and with very good reason), an adorable service-dog-dropout hound who steals the show, and a supporting cast that enhances the story significantly. While the book is indeed long, I personally think that's a good thing when the story moves along well and the characters are likeable (such as is the case here); I'm definitely not complaining about getting to spend more time in this world of Kinship that Ms. Score created. While this book is certainly built around the budding romance between Maggie and Silas, and it's got an interesting little mystery running through it, I'd say the most important aspect of the story revolves around the relationships being both developed and repaired. The plot is different and the ensemble cast enjoyable, ensuring that this story is one that will stand out in my memory rather than get lost among so many others.",5.0,1,2022
I enjoyed it!,"As a cartographer, there were a few things in this book that had me questioning but I think for most people those would be easily overlooked and not hurt the story. I enjoyed the suspense of the book. At first I had some trouble with the style where full chapters were from a different character's point of view, but once I figured that out it made sense and worked well. I started the book on a 2-hour flight then got a hooked and ended up reading it in 2 days! The characters were fun, though the ""magical"" part was unexpected it was told in a way that made it somewhat believable.  I read this for a monthly book club I belong to and I think it was a good choice. Most of our group did enjoy it.",5.0,1,2022
Not my idea of romance.,"I had high hopes for this book. It began in an interesting way and then took a nose dive into depravity. Not my idea of romance.

Sad, because the writing is very good.",1.0,0,2022
"Boiler Plate characters and plot, nothing special.","I picked up Paths of Power wondering if I was going to like it or not.  Author Sean Barber had no previously written books for me to have read so I was going by the description on the back.  It did appear to be a sub-genre of cultivation/post-apoc tale that I enjoy.<br /><br />And the writing is fairly good quality.  There were a few missed wrong words, but I doubt anyone is going to be thrown off by them.  The story moves along smoothly and at a fairly easy to read flowing pace.<br /><br />Sadly, while the writing itself is quality and the talent is clearly there, a couple of editorial choices combined with dipping a bit too deep into the central casting cliche toolbox left me feeling that this story could have been just a bit better.<br /><br />One of the editorial choices I can easily point to.  Early in the tale on more than one occasion the main character thinks about specific books in the LitRPG genre he's read and compares his current situation to those.  I understand to a point why this was done, but it was not something that pleased me as a reader, especially as I have a strong dislike to one of the series referenced.  Sean would have been much better served keeping these references generic.<br /><br />The other editorial choice involves the use of a character with traits that honestly did not affect the story and felt like the author was making a nod to something outside the story itself.  I'm sure someone who reads the book will recognize the situation when it comes up, but I don't want to spoil the tale by saying more.<br /><br />But that also plays to my complaint about the many reaches into the central casting cliche box.  One thing we end up seeing multiple times is the power-mad warlord who within a week of the start of a big apocalyptic reset somehow has gathered an army and is going out a conquering.  I have said in other reviews that I dislike this cliche unless there are clear signs of careful world building and plot preparation to explain how this warlord can herd people into an army that quickly after the apocalypse starts.  In this case there is absolutely no build up.<br /><br />Its still a readable and enjoyable story, but I just can't put it into my recommend list for this genre.",3.0,0,2022

Great story but just a little too much,"Sonia Purnell, kudos to you for taking on the story of Virginia Hall.  The story is fascinating, and I am in awe of the amount of research it took to write this book.  There is always so much more to learn about WWII.  I feel guilty giving this book only 3 stars but here is why:  it is just too many people, too many places, somewhat dry, too much detail and it kind of rambles.  I found it hard to follow and by 30% started skimming the chapters.  I would have enjoyed knowing more about her life once she returned home.<br /><br />If I were Sonia, or her publisher, I would take the same terrific body of information and turn it in to a really interesting biography.  Slim it down, make it a story and more people will love it.  I felt the same way about David McCullough’s Path Between the Seas about the Panama Canal.

Best book on estrangement from an adult child I've read...,"I have read four other books on this subject, but this book really gets down to the nitty-gritty in a heartbeat.

Honestly Just Blown Away!!! I Highly Recommend This Book!,"I don't give a lot of 5 star book reviews but I'd give this book 6 if I could.....<br /><br />No spoilers review:<br />Against all odds a mysterious and mute young woman is hired as the live in nanny to a wealthy, well-connected and VERY DANGEROUS man. He's basically an enforcer for a highly influential secret organization called The Society (IVI) and is waaaaay too good at his job. The Society is like the mafia but even more powerful, less flashy, more refined and their members have infiltrated just about every sector of regular society. Darn good world building here and I'm dying to learn more about it and the Sovereign Sons.<br /><br />I've read a lot romance novels centered around organized crime syndicates, so I'll admit I came in expecting the usual male/female dynamic that is repeated so often in this genre but I couldn't have been more wrong:<br /><br />To start, I found Natalia to be one of the best written FMCs I've read in a long time. I fell head over heels for her and I totally got why Alessio and Nino gravitate so quickly to her. She's so darn strong and competent, but still warm and capable of great love and affection. She's also incredibly fractured due to a series of vicious and cruel acts of violence perpetrated against her (it's not shown in detail, only explained in past tense). She's got a massive secret and a painfully traumatic past, but she's no victim and there are a few scenes in the book where she gets to show how much of a survivor she truly is!<br /><br />Alessio is my new favorite Gamma! He's essentially Society royalty because he is a direct descendant of one of the founding families. He's got major sway within his world, is respected and feared and is not one to be F-ed with. He was such a dichotomy and often vacillates between cold and mean and incredibly sweet and loving, which did get a little tiresome as time went on (but people don't change over night so I pushed through). He and Natalia mirror one another in terms of devastating past trauma but where she is still emotionally open, he's so painfully closed off. But there is clearly still deep love and a yearning for connection within him. He just has to learn to let those stunted emotions out which takes much trial and error. He also has his own little secret that I have yet to see in ANY other MALE leads in the mafia romance genre, and I found it kind of endearing and only adds to his delicious layers.<br /><br />Overall just a well written book with so many twists and turns. Many of the secrets and bombshells are revealed around the 50% mark, so the 2nd half is about dealing with the fallout, which I found incredibly refreshing. The author doesn't wait until the last few chapters of the book to reveal everything and then wrap it up in a rushed manner. There is sufficient time to really dive into all of the repercussions and that gave the book a more fleshed out feel for me! It may be considered very graphic/violent to some people but for me it STILL managed to be a very poignant, emotional, heartwarming love story. Watching Alessio, Natalia and Nino slowly breaking down each other's walls was such a pleasure and it will give you so many tender moments in an otherwise gritty book! I'm so sad it's ended and I can't stop thinking about them days later. Hands down the best mafia-esque book that I've ever read (I'm still fairly new to the genre). I already want to re-read it which is always the mark of a good book in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm truly impressed by this author and I cannot believe I've never read her material before.<br /><br />Triggers:<br />Murder<br />Rape (not shown, but very important to the plot)<br />Torture<br />Drugging<br />Kidnapping",5.0,1,2022

Our FL has the ability to make mushrooms grow on people when she feels strong emotions, and they pop up everywhere throughout the book.  Not only is the story well told, but I found myself doing a little research on the mushrooms as they were introduced so it was an educational read as well.  Overall, a good book if you are looking for a fun read with a few fungi facts thrown in.",5.0,1,2022
Disappointed,"This is my first book by this author. Nick was trash and Summer was weak. Summer and Nick date for a year. Nick breaks it off when he starts having feelings for Summer because of past hurt. Summer discovers she is pregnant. She doesn’t tell Nick because of something he said. Of course he finds out about it and is angry. We basically see Nick treat summer bad but for some reason she still love him. The thing that bothered me was we got to see how Nick treat he bad but never got to see him back things right. Yes, he felt guilty about how he treated Summer and even said sorry. We never got to see him over the course of time start treat her better. There was no therapy just the premarital counseling. We just got the happy ending.",1.0,0,2022
A Prison Story,This s the first book I have read by this author.  It was interesting reading about the lives of the different women connected to the prison.  It showed the compassionate side of both prisoners and employees.,4.0,1,2022
over to soon,I need more. I need some on tour bonus scenes or something. If you’re going to give me single person pov please give it to me from the guy’s perspective. This was exactly what I need. THIS is what I have been in the mood for. Tan is so good at building your connection to her characters without a lot of fluff and I love that. I need to quit playing and finish her backlist.  And 5 stars for the way this gives your fat girl rep without making everything about her weight. Fat girls deserve to just be a MC full stop.,4.0,1,2022
"Realm of Demons - one of my least favorite in series, disappointing","I was enjoying this series, so was surprised how long this book felt with the endless fighting, cussing, running, lying, cussing, fighting, and more lying, fighting and cussing. What I loved in the earlier books was the relationships and the humor.  In this book, relationships were just a bit of filler for the fighting, cussing, and endless ""falling off cliff and grabbing a tiny root on the way down"".  There was no downtime for the characters to just be - a tiny cuddle during sleep doesn't work. Shannon loves using the F-bomb, endlessly.  I mostly try to ignore it, but it reminded me of an old Eddie Murphy comedy night where every other word was the F word and it was just stupid.  Not funny or interesting.  What was very jarring was a sentence in her book with a reference to Christ (and donkey).  What was the point of that? Humor? to be shocking? Mak came across as weak and uninteresting. There was no space given to Lila and Fen - characters I was interested in; and their relationship was tied up with a few words that were completely flat and unsatisfactory. Only a sentence or two was given to Lila as queen; very little written about the dragons (whatever happened to the one who could move the earth). Everything felt rushed.  And the book ended with a reference I had no idea what it meant. I think another reviewer mentioned that it connects to book 1 of another series, but I doubt I care enough to look it up.  The last 4 or more books of Shannon's have been disappointing, and she used to be one of my favorite authors.  I have bought MANY of her books. (Loved the one with Breene; hated the one with St Clare).  This book had typos and scene issues I didn't notice in her other books.  In another review I wrote of one of her works in a different series, I wondered if Shannon is writing too much, too quickly as the quality of her writing has dropped a lot.  Two stars because I finished it.",2.0,0,2022
I think this is a rough draft,This has to be a rough draft version. I just refuse to believe they let this book drop with this many errors...and for $6.99??? I was really looking forward to Kay and Lucus's story. I was disappointed. We should have got a look at how their relationship started before the breakup and I could have seen from both of their prospectives what happened. It was too much repetitiveness being said in every chapter. And it ended abruptly.<br /><br />This was not what I expected so I sent this back for a refund.,2.0,0,2022
It's different,"I have to start at one particular line that is.... Just incorrect.<br /><br />Hysterectomies are readily available. Reese doesn't know why women who don't want kids are not lined up to have them.<br /><br />Ahem. They are not readily available. Before the reversal of Roe there were still plenty of unqualified people up in a women's reproductive business. There's a woman I know who is just certain that she will never want kids, she had to go to eight different doctors to have a hysterectomy, one doctor referred her very calm and lucid self for a psych evaluation. These doctors refused, sure that she wasn't sure of herself, until finally she found the one.<br /><br />The second woman I will use as an example, in her 40's, two kids, happily married, family complete. She had horrible periods that plagued her for years. She had to go to four different doctors for her hysterectomy. The doctor's didn't want to stop her periods and be responsible for the hormone replacement, when this is what she wanted, to live with the hormone issue, but not in pain.<br /><br />It's just not correct, it seems like a small thing for me, a uterus bearing person, to focus on, when it comes from a non-uterus bearing character in the book, but I had to say it.<br /><br />Otherwise, I found the flashbacks disjointed, they were written and inserted in such a way to take from the main story, not enhance it. I ended up skipping the last few flash back chapters because they just didn't fit in the flow to me.<br /><br />It was a really interesting perspective, and I am glad to have read the modern story for it's perspective, thank you.",3.0,0,2022
"Intriguing, Original, Unsettling","I really enjoyed the premise of the mystery in this book --- a group of monks in a secluded monastery of northern Quebec are divided on how they should express their love of God and their God-given musical gifts.  It was very believable and Gamache went about his investigation in his usual quiet, intentional way.  Some people say this book moved too slowly.  I can understand that observation, but a lot of detective novels feel slow-paced to me, which can certainly seem tedious.<br /><br />It has been a while since I read a Louise Penny book -- I think the last one was the raid on the factory, in which lives were lost.  Gamache carries a lot of self-blame.  His right-hand man, Jean-Guy, who is conducting a secret relationship with Gamache's daughter Annie, is painted in this book as a bit of a self-absorbed turd.  He is recovering from a narcotics addiction (pain killers from injuries sustained in the factory raid) and is very impatient with the contemplative, spiritual orientation of the monks.  I got irritated with him in short order.  When a character devolves in this way, it's very often an indication that the author is planning to dispose of the character as the story unfolds.  While Jean-Guy is not completely disposed of, he gets thrown under the bus due largely to his own weaknesses.  As for Sylvain Francoeur, the interfering (& evil) admin from La Surete, well,  I hope some future book details his grisly demise.",4.0,1,2022
Worthwhile read,"While not a follower of trump or an admirer of Mr. Barr's recent stint as AG, the book is well written.<br />It was interesting to get an inside look at the workings of the administration.<br />I believe Barr, to his credit, ""calls them as he sees them"". A good thing.",3.0,0,2022
Tells it like it is,"The writing style is very personable...as if the author was sitting for coffee with you. Doctrinally sound, ones heart and soul are touched if the reader is open to hear the Good News. It's no wonder that pastor Spurgeon continues even this day to touch lives for the Savior.",5.0,1,2022
Best Post-Divorce Book Ever!,"I wish I had this book eleven years ago when my childhood sweetheart and husband of 44 years up and left me because...okay...I'll leave that out and write my own book if I can do it with a sense of humor akin to Debbie Seagle's. I read this on my kindle but am buying the book(s) to share with all the other women who need to follow her advice and just DOiT. I wish all men would read this book; it would be a wake-up call to most...as long as they have enough humility to override their egos. Even if you aren't divorced but have lived with or met with some kind of tragedy, this book will help you ""let go"" and move forward with joy and courage. Do it for YOU!",5.0,1,2022
Prescient,"I laughed a little bit when I read the first review.  Apparently, it wasn't what that reviewer was expecting at all.<br /><br />McDevitt novels never are.<br /><br />And then we have Moonfall.  It was nothing even close to what I was expecting.  McDevitt tends to be a good, clever writer who has interesting scenarios and settings followed by average endings.  I tend to like authors like that, with my favorite being Jeff Long.  I can't help but wonder what would happen if one of these authors could complete the deal.<br /><br />I think I've figured it out.<br /><br />Moonfall has stayed with me for a good year after I finished reading it.  I'll go out on a limb to say that this was the best novel I've read in some time.  However, the timing had a lot to do with it.<br /><br />Occasionally, I'll read a book that just so happens to be extremely relevant by sheer chance.  Like when I read Fahrenheit 451 during the 2016 election.  Had I read that book ten years prior, I would have not understood the full implications.<br /><br />Had I not read Moonfall a year into the pandemic, I would not have been able to suspend disbelief at what was happening in the book.  A year into the pandemic, and I am absolutely amazed that McDevitt was able to predict such ridiulosity in the shadow of an international catastrophe.<br /><br />There is a neat plot twist in the book that is well foreshadowed.  That's also something I like, and the suspense that was built up multiple times in increasing degrees of intensity made the ending very satisfying.<br /><br />Prior to reading Moonfall, I would have said Jack McDevitt is an above average author who just so happens to write about subject material that interests me.  After reading Moonfall, I'm putting him in my category of ""favorite authors"".<br /><br />Oh, and the fact that he regularly references North Dakota with a fair degree of accuracy helps.",5.0,1,2022

Two Sides of the Same Coin / The Portrait of Dorothea Puente,"This is a true crime story of two sides of the same coin. Only in this instance the other side of the coin is horribly mutilated. Another parallel I can give to the life of murderess Dorothea Puente is that of the picture of Dorian Gray. While Dorian behaved deplorably his deeds were never reflected in his personal appearance. Outwardly he was a devilishly handsome young man that women found very attractive and charming, whereas men envied him and wished to have his luck and looks. Unbeknownst to everyone Dorian had a terrible secret he had a portrait commissioned. For every terrible deed he participated in his portrait bore the horrors of his actions. It became a truly horrific work of art showing his truly damned soul.<br /><br />Similarly Dorothea Puente came across as this sweet little old lady who the public only knew as someone who took in and helped the needy and downtrodden. She won civil awards for her dedication. Her own portrait of her truly evil black heart was where no one could see it. And when people began to suspect her of her murderous actions they disappeared before they could tell the truth the gentle kindly false face was so great at hiding. Her years of telling lies made her quick on her feet in whatever situation she found herself in. She could come up a suitable story that her out of a lot of trouble. Even after the bodies were found in her yard how was she able to slip away from the police? Elderly murderess Dorothea Puente was elderly, clever, lucky, and homicidal.<br /><br />Ms. Ortiz has become a true crime writer. She has honed her skill and is able to portray her monsters in truly a credible  fashion that keeps you reading until the end. What I found especially interesting was reading the killer's backstory. What made her capable of perpetuating such a series of astonishing crimes?",5.0,1,2022
New Series Starter,"This is the start of a new series. There appears to be a continuing story line but this book ends with an HEA for the couple involved. Stasia is a non-typical rich girl who’s in danger, Owen is her bodyguard with a secret. She’s serious and uptight, he’s laid back and optimistic. The story is simple on the surface but there are underlying threats, mysteries and nuances that I hope to see more about in the next books. I liked both characters but didn’t see them together in the beginning. As we get to know them, they are more suited and their chemistry is undeniable. Supporting characters leave us with additional questions but Stasia and Owen’s story is complete. Enjoyable read but at this point I’m more interested what wasn’t in the story and can’t wait for the next books.",4.0,1,2022
"Laporte can write, but what she writes isn't enjoyable","I was beginning to enjoy this story, although the heroine's self-hating emotional spiraling wasn't wonderful.  But then, just when I was expecting it to get better, the narrative just fell off a cliff for me.  And the emotional self-destructiveness got worse, and now the men in her life were doing it as well, just a little differently.<br /><br />And there wasn't much else going on to keep the story engaging.  So I bailed out about halfway through: I just don't see the fun in reading ""light romantic fiction"" telling me about the travails of neurotic characters escaped from a therapy session.",2.0,0,2022
