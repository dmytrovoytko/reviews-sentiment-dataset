Here Come The Trolls. . .,"I felt compelled to respond due to the ""1st negative review"" I just read,(insert eye roll here)  as obviously, this was not written by a lover of Twilight books/films.  I have had the hardcover pre-ordered for months, but we are in the middle of a hurricane, so I had to opt and buy the kindle, due to the unlikelihood of the book being delivered today.<br /><br />It's been 15 years since the first Twilight book came out, and several years when Meyer's manuscript was released on the internet. She vowed to never finish, yet, here we are, she did finish it for her fans! I have been counting down the days until this was released for the past few months.<br /><br />It is the same story yet told differently. Everyone has a story but the perception is different when the other party tells the story. My husband wrote a book, he tells ""our story"" in a part of his memoir. Although similar, it is different due to his tone, and his recollection of events. When I tell our story it is the same story, yet there are stark differences. This is due to a different author, different verbiage, and a different tone. Although it is the same story, it is interesting to hear it told through someone else's eyes.<br /><br />As far as Midnight Sun, it is Edward, he was a little stuck up and reserved. We noticed this from the first twilight book/movie when he walked into the cafeteria and heard Bella's friends speaking of him, and he walked past and rolled his eyes. . . When he went to protect Bella from the guys she ran into while alone at the book store, he was aggressive and confident. It is just how Edward was. Bella softened him up and showed a different and less reserved and relaxed version of Edward. He grew throughout the series. They both did.<br /><br />So yes, the beginning of the book, Edward seems like a conceited jerk, but we never knew who he was before Bella, yet, we are learning now and I want to know. I have been waiting for this version. We only knew how he was pre-Bella, so this is very different.<br /><br />If you were a Twilight fan and felt like there was more of a story to tell, that it didn't need to just end, this will help fill in this void. If you are not a Twilight fan, you will just hate this book and complain about how horrible it is. If you didn't like the first 4, you will in NO WAY like this.<br /><br />As far as me? I loved hearing this story told in Edwards point of view. I am a HUGE Twilight fan, a 43-year-old Twilight fan at that!  Thank you to Stephanie Meyer for finally finishing and releasing Midnight Sun. Twilight Fans, you will NOT be disappointed.",5.0,1,2020
"No ""adults in the room"".  The only guardrail now is Trump's obsesssion with reelection...","First, the elephant in the room where it happened. Yes, John Bolton admits in this book, that the New York Times’ reporting during the impeachment was true: Bolton –did- back up the impeachment by leaking that Trump had withheld congressional funding from Ukraine in order to pressure them to lie and smear Joe Biden (and also to lie and say that Putin hadn’t cheated for Trump to win in 2016.) He withheld tax payer dollars to try to cheat and win the 2020 election--definitely impeachable and disqualifying.<br /><br />Unfortunately, leaked quotes to the New York Times did not sway Bolton’s fellow Republicans in the Senate in the way that his actual testimony (or even a press conference or sworn affidavit) could have.<br /><br />Bolton, not lacking in self-regard, has no regrets about his decision not to testify. He even, near the end of this book, bizarrely, accuses the House Managers of committing “impeachment malpractice” by not making a broader case. (He chooses to forget that Trump ordered complete non-cooperation from federal employees and also forbade everyone from turning over any requested documents.)<br /><br />It was only because of the testimonies of people far, far braver than John Bolton—and some good lawyering—that the Democrats were able to build a strong case against President Trump.  (Bolton writes that they should have taken their time—apparently also forgetting that the impeachment was about Trump “cheating to win” (again) in 2020. “Cheating to win an upcoming election” wasn’t the kind of danger to democracy that Democrats could pursue at their leisure.)<br /><br />Fortunately, there were some public servants who were far braver than NSA Bolton, including his own subordinates—Fiona Hill and Lt. Commander Alex Vindman. Unlike their boss, they risked their careers and saw their reputations falsely smeared, in order to do the right thing for their country. (In Vindman’s case, Trump not only fired him in retaliation for responding to the subpoena, he also fired his twin brother, an NSC lawyer with no involvement at all in the impeachment.<br /><br />I thought Bolton might have praised Vindman and Hill and the others who DID testify in spite of the risks. But, based on how he comes across in this 500+ page memoir, Bolton's not apparently the self-reflective type, and so, he doesn’t.<br /><br />For those expecting a juicy, gossipy book, this really isn't it. Most of the best quotes have already become public. (As has the president's stunning ignorance. Bolton tells us Trump didn't know that Finland is a country or that the UK is a nuclear power.)  Much of this book is about Bolton doing his job as NSA. He writes a lot about his work--and makes it sound like work--the meetings he took with others, the policies he wanted to see in North Korea...Syria...Iran...China... Europe, etc.  Honestly, a lot of this is very dull--and worse, if you don't even like the policies.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find Bolton a very satisfying observer, maybe because of his political orientation.  Time and again, he's in an interesting situation, but doesn't have much of interest to say about it. One example is that press conference between Putin and Trump in Helsinki, which was televised in full, following their one-on-one two hour meeting.  Bolton leaves out the context of the two men's answers--he shares Trump's dislike of reporters--and his summaries of what was said is poor.  As always, he shortchanges the importance of the Mueller investigation, including that just three days earlier Mueller indicted 13 Russians for their interference with the U.S. 2016 election.  He does mention what a bombshell Trump's expressed support for Putin over U.S. intel was, but doesn't write about the event or followup in a very interesting way. (Maybe Dan Coats will write a memoir some day. Trump's DNI almost resigned over Helsinki, per Bolton.)  As with the rest of the book we really don't get much sense of Donald Trump as a personality--what Bolton believes that the president is thinking and feeling, why he does what he does.  (Again, if only the writer was a journalist or historian.)<br /><br />Bolton clearly sees Putin as a U.S. adversary, and one who is in control of the Putin-Trump relationship. It surprised me that he didn't see this as a greater threat to the U.S. because of Trump's ongoing subservience to him, shown in Helsinki as other places.  He -does- seem more alarmed by the realization that this as a pattern--how easily foreign autocrats and dictators, including Kim, Xi and Erdogan, find it to manipulate Donald Trump by appealing to his self-interest and his vanity.<br /><br />(I -was- interested in the description of Putin as having two ways of interacting with others ""either humiliating them or dominating them"". (Sound familiar?) But this is just an aside. There's a blandness to much of Bolton's narrative, a passivity that makes you want a journalist or historian ""in the room"" instead.)<br />Bolton's narrative makes it clear that Trump doesn't care one bit for human rights, democracy or the rule of law.  He encourages Xi Jinping to build concentration camps to imprison China's 1 million Uighurs.  He only makes a statement about Saudi buddy Muhammed bin Salman's role in the grisly murder of journalist--and American resident--Jamal Khashoggi--because he wants to distract reporters from Ivanka's abuse of private email.<br /><br />Trump's betrayal of the Syrian Kurds'--for years acknowledged as such courageous and reliable U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS--marks another deplorable chapter in U.S. foreign policy. Trump's heartless comments as he plans to abandon the Kurds--including their families and villages--to Turkish troops are too painful to repeat here.  Bolton had left by the time the policy was finalized, but he obviously also didn't care.  To him, the fate of Syrian Kurds was simply, ""all about Iran"".  Mattis resigned over it, but Bolton never asks himself who would ever trust the United States again?  Trump managed to turn his one foreign policy success in the Middle East into an abject failure.<br /><br />It can be disconcerting when a writer's personality and political viewpoint differ so strongly from one's own. For example, Bolton describes a trip to NATO headquarters that sent Mattis, Kelly and himself into a panic. Trump--always eager to undermine NATO (coincidentally, also a top Putin goal)--was going to threaten to leave if Germany didn't ""pay what they owed"".  Bolton says he ""doesn't know"" if Trump actually was wrong--over and over--about the arrangement or just was short-handing the fact that it was about NATO countries funding their military defense, not money..<br /><br />Well, you don't need national security clearance to know that Trump absolutely doesn't understand that NATO nations' are talking about the amount they're spending on their own defense, not something paid into a mutual ""kitty"" (they have one of those, too, but that's never what Trump is badgering them about.)  As usual, his target was Germany, whose leader--a woman--has emerged as the global leader of democracies, now that the U.S. has abdicated the role. Anyway, the meeting is tense, and eventually it ends without the U.S. withdrawing from yet another international agreement (Bolton, by the way, hates the Paris Climate Accords and the Iran Nuclear Deal. In this, he and Trump are quite simpatico.)  There's a large group at the end and Merkel extends her hand. Instead of shaking it, Trump bends down and kisses her on both cheeks, exclaiming, ""I love Angela!"" The onlookers, according to Bolton, applaud.  He seems to feel this was a good moment.  I felt embarrassed by my president and his team when reading it. (The Bush back rub wasn't bad enough?)<br /><br />Despite taking his book title from the hit musical ""Hamilton"", Bolton does little to create scenes and make events and personalities come alive. Much of this book is dry and dull. Still, Bolton may deserve –some- credit anyway for bringing it out before the election. (It’s really not ALL about the $2 million from Simon & Schuster, right?) He has, after all, made himself widely disliked on both the right and the left—and also has antagonized the ever-vindictive president and his powerful lackeys, including the attorney general. Trump and Barr have already indicated that they will make sure that Bolton -does- pay a price for making Trump look so bad,<br /><br />There've been a lot of unflattering quotes from this book--probably most of the interesting things are already out there. But he also appears to whitewash Trump's personality and his lack of dexterity with the language. Bolton mentions how the president is unfocused and talks too much (including during his infrequent intelligence briefings). But he never tries to capture the rambling, repetitive, often disturbing quality of Trump's unique style of verbal expression.  Trump here, like everyone else, speaks in short, succinct phrases whenever directly quoted.  In fact, everyone in direct quotes basically sounds the same. Did the publisher want quote marks in the text even though these are obviously NOT exact quotes?<br /><br />Again, I want a journalist or historian ""in the room"" with Trump on these occasions.  I want to know what was really said.<br /><br />Bolton doesn't represent Trump's unique verbal style--or his well-known temper and tirades, He does, at times, remind you of how often he fires people--and how often they quit. Or, as in Bolton's case, it's both. Bolton quit  and gave notice, only to have Trump jump the gun and announce that Bolton had been fired. It's credible because we saw him do the same with SOD James Mattis.<br /><br /> In one of the most disturbing quotes, Bolton observes that ""obstruction of justice as a way of life"" for Trump.  He warns that if he is re-elected, the ""last guardrail"" on the president--his obsession with being reelected--will be removed.  At that point, Bolton--who sees in Trump an opportunist with no core principles or philosophy--could do anything that he felt benefited him personally.  Given his warmth toward the world's dictators and autocrats--Putin, Kim Jung Un, Saudi MBS, Turkey's Erdogan, Xi--the potential for even greater corruption in a second term is huge.  Even now, Bolton describes Trump promising Erdogan he will intervene in a case involving the Turkish bank and SDNY ""as soon as I put my people in"". (Will he do the same for his major lender, Deutschebank?  We don't know how interconnected his personal interests are with the financial perks from the dictators of the world since he refuses to release his tax returns.).<br /><br />Bolton worked for George W. Bush, GWH Bush, and Ronald Reagan. But his 17 months with Donald Trump convinced him that not only was Trump unlike any other U.S. president, he was unfit to hold the office. Unfit, yet with Trump's 89% popularity with Republicans according to recent polls, and with the generally unwavering support from elected Republicans, it's hard to know if Bolton's intended audience will be reading this.  Election Day is less than five months away. The question you're left with is:: Will Bolton's warning make any difference?",3.0,0,2020
Well-written and well-researched narrative of governing with Trump in charge. But...,"This is a well researched book, of course, given Rucker's and Leonnig's reputation (and a Pulitzer prize each). They interviewed nearly 200 people, many of them top Trump advisors although most chose to remain unnamed sources. There are a lot of quotes, enlivening the text, and they know how to lay out a strong narrative with often-vivid details about the participants.<br /><br />There's no getting around it  President Trump is shown as erratic, impulsive, ignorant of the things a president should know, vindictive, profane and mean.  He runs a chaotic administration and likes it that way.  Pitting people against each other, creating insecure lackeys, is his preferred management style.  He did it at the Trump Organization, and the opportunities for testing loyalties--and making himself the center of all the attention--are even greater now.<br /><br />How many books describing a completely unfit president will be published before his core support drops significantly?  Books come. Books go, and yet Trump's support among Republicans in Congress and voters (95% or so approve of him) remains basically unchanged. (And, spoiler. The title is ironic, at least for the authors. Trump, who's used it at least four times, seems completely convinced of his superiority. In his mind, it is always others who have to be wrong--while he has to get all of the credit.  The writing was on the wall for Steve Bannon after he made the cover of TIME.  Trump treats both political appointees and experienced government experts the same--with disdain and disrespect.  He doesn't listen, won't learn, and thinks he knows ""more than the generals""...also, more than the communications director, the financial experts, intelligence officials, lawyers....and on and on.  As some previous biographers have noted, it would not surprise him to be told he knows more than anyone. He would agree.) When things go wrong—and they often do—his first thought is to find someone to blame. (And blame them he will, even if the problems were caused because they did exactly as he told them to.)<br /><br />Trump’s leadership style is also defined here by his temper, by uncontrolled (and apparently uncontrollable) rages.  This is not a psychologically well man. He is shown frequently ranting, raving, reducing people to tears (Nielsen and Sessions and Spicer are just three of them). We've all seen how he insults and demeans his political opponents or anyone who mildly criticizes him.  But Trump doesn't even treat ""his"" people with respect.  There is no manager in America who would not be reported for this kind of abusive behavior to HR--too many examples to list--and fired if it continued.  What Trump creates in the workplace is the definition of a ""hostile work environment"".<br /><br />His verbal abuse of others--including publicly humiliating women who don't even work for the government anymore like Lisa Page--would not be tolerated (by law) at any workplace in America.  Why are the behaviors these authors describe tolerated from the nation's top CEO?  There is no one who can rein him in and it's unnerving to read about his unrestrained tirades, including calling the nation's top generals--with their aides present, squirming-- ""babies"" and “dopes”. How is this permitted from the nation's president?<br /><br />Rex Tillerson wasn't a good SOS, but at least he shows up in book after book as having the spine to stand up to Trump.  He was genuinely upset about how Trump--who took five draft deferments during Vietnam--disrespected the nation's military leaders.  Tillerson did not deny calling Trump an ""f-ing moron"" after the above “dopes” meeting.  Preibus corralled Pence afterward to come and show Rex how to treat Trump with proper deference and how not look to look so contemptuous when he spoke--repetitiously, ignorantly, ramblingly, irrelevantly--in group meetings.  Working for Trump, means knowing and accepting that that loyalty is EVERYTHING.  And you show you're loyalty by endless flattery and compliance with whatever Donald Trump wants.<br /><br />Leonnig and Rucker show a profile of the nation from the Oval Office.  If I had to make a criticism--observation, really--its that it benefits from all their sources but also suffers from them.  With so much emphasis on information from those who had the willingness to work with Trump in the first place, the book fills a certain political niche, but lacks the sweep of popular history.  There's not enough about how Trump policies are impacting real peoples' lives, and little about what others are doing in opposition to his policies--and why.  The travel ban is one impactful decision extensively described, but the descriptions are largely confined to reactions in the executive branch (and, in one brief passage, what Trump staff sees happening at airports via television.).<br /><br />There’s ample detail but sometimes it lacks context.  The Russia investigation, for example, is gone into at great length, but some of Trump's statements are treated as if we all should assume they're true.  After how the authors' own paper has documented over 16,000 presidential lies in 3 years, they should be in the forefront of encouraging readers to be skeptical of whatever he says.  Certainly, no one can say with certainty what President Trump ""feels"" or ""believes"" about anything.  All we really know is what he says and does. This includes reaction to the Mueller investigation which has a number of missing pieces in the retelling, and is marred by the idea that ""Trump believed Putin when he said he wasn't involved"".<br /><br />""A Very Stable Genius"" is an up close look at Trump and how he governs. It rarely pulls the lens back for a wider view, for a look at his impact around America and how he's changing the country with his laws, his deregulations, his nationalism and his apparent goal of returning to the America of the 1950s. They leave it largely to the reader to make those conclusions for themselves. Some will appreciate that approach; others will wish for more of a sustained argument that a president like this is dangerously unfit for office.<br /><br />They quote one official who summarizes  Trump's impact at the top.  In the beginning of his administration, ""There was more of an ethos in the place of trying to help the institution and to help enlighten him rather than simply to execute his marching orders.""  Now, this official said, ""I'm not sure there are many, if any, left who view as their responsibility trying to help educate, moderate, enlighten and persuade--or even advise in many cases.  There's a new ethos: This is a presidency of one.  It's Trump unleashed, unchained, unhinged.""  In the end, we are left to imagine with some alarm what a second term would be like.",4.0,1,2020
"There should be a subtitle: ""How to make everything about race for fun and profit""","For someone who claims to be an anti-racist, the author spends an amazing amount of words making everything in the world about race. He can't even talk about getting his college acceptance letter without making a big deal about the race of the people standing around him when it happened.<br /><br />Every chapter begins with definitions of words related to race and racism. But Dr. Kendi not only picks the words, but makes up his own definitions for them so that he can then explain to all of us uneducated racists why they're such bad, bad things. His definition of the word race is blathering nonsense.<br />""Race: A power construct of collected or merged difference that lives socially.""<br />A power construct lives socially? I didn't know power constructs lived at all, Dr. Kendi!<br /><br />Kendi sets up a straw man in the form of a blatantly false dichotomy between ""assimilationists"" (who, according to him, think everyone not white is inferior, but can be taught to ""be white"" and, thus, fully human) and ""segregationists"" (who he says also think everyone not white is inferior, but are sure they can never learn to be white, i.e. human). This is, of course, nonsense. 99.999% of Americans do not believe either of these ideas, yet Kendi treats them as if everyone who is white MUST belong to one of these groups.<br /><br />Even the American ""melting pot"" is racist to Dr. Kendi. To him, it's forcing people to ""be white"" or not be accepted. I can't imagine the size of the blinders he's wearing to not see the influences of cultures from all over the world have had and are having on American society.<br />Rap music is one of the biggest-selling genres.<br />African-American athletes have multi-million dollar contracts with MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, etc., etc.<br />It's hard to find even a small town in America that doesn't have restaurants that specialize in Italian, Chinese, Mexican/Tex-Mex food. A town of less than 3000 people not far from me has all 3.<br /><br />Then there's the bald-faced lie about President Trump calling Latinx immigrants animals. I know the media repeated this lie so many times that many people believe it's true (probably even more than think Sarah Palin actually said she could see Russia from her house), but the fact is he was talking very specifically about gang members (MS-13, to be very specific) that abuse our lax immigration/sanctuary laws to gain entrance to the country then engage in crimes ranging from drug dealing to cold-blooded murder. (You can look it up...Amazon doesn't seem to like me trying to include external links to news stories in my reviews.)<br /><br />Dr. Kendi has made a career of writing books about how horrible race relations are in the United States. The common thread through all of his books is, ""White is bad...always."" It's almost as if he is actively looking for racism and somehow, miraculously always finding it!<br /><br />This book will not show anyone how to be an antiracist. All it will do is try to get people to accept Dr. Kendi's ""white people are bad...all the time...in every way"" mentality...and make him a lot of money.<br /><br />I'd really like to know why my first review of this book was deleted. If someone reported it because this isn't a ""Verified purchase"" that's because I read the Kindle preview then got the book from the library. If it's for any other reason, I defy anyone to try and disprove one word of my review based on the content of the book.",1.0,0,2020
Monotonous,"Dragging pace and repetitive, I feel like I’ve been reading this book for 300 years— and I haven’t quite struggled to the halfway point! Add an immature protagonist who never seems to learn anything or grow spiritually and a few lackluster love interests and you have the recipe for a boring, go nowhere read that leaves you scratching your head. It is very rare for me to give up on a book, but when you find yourself rooting for the devil to end the misery of continuing the story, it’s time to slam the cover closed!",2.0,0,2020
Disappointing. Weak characters. Unanswered plot lines,"The premise of the story about the twins lives got lost in many pages of LGBTQ trans issues. It was like there was not enough going on with the sisters lives, the author felt it necessary to throw this red herring into the story. And I don’t say plot because it was not part of the plot. I was very intrigued about the lives of the sisters, but I got no satisfaction of what made them what they were. They just moved from one day to the next like they could not take charge of their lives. They each suffered a malaise that was similarly experienced but the author was too lazy to explore it. Ending was unsatisfying and abrupt.",2.0,0,2020
Should be in the fiction section,"I’m trying to read this book but it’s hard. Reads like a grade schooler wrote it. The authors, and I use that word loosely, claim H and M didn’t contribute to the book. Then how do they know some intimate details that they claim are true? Of course Meghan contributed. It’s a book trying to make her look like a victim when poor Harry is her victim like Trevor and Cory were. No one is as perfect as this book claims she is. I had high hopes for this marriage. A beautiful young American for a handsome prince. But the more I saw of this ungrateful couple the more disillusioned I became. I had hoped this book might change my mind but no, I just wasted my money.",1.0,0,2020
Stelter shows how Fox hosts serve as propagandists for Trump--and also nfluence his policies,"Stelter does a public service with this book, though those who need to read it most very llkely won't do so.  It shows how the morally unsavory Roger Ailes was put in charge of Fox News by conservative Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch and turned it into a rightwing propaganda machine.  Stelter also shows how far back Ailes and Trump went--and Fox's role, thanks to Ailes, in turning Trump into someone conservatives listened to about politics.<br /><br />It was 2011 when Ailes started a weekly call-in feature every Monday with Trump on ""Fox and Friends"" As Stelter says ""the show reflected Ailes's hatred of Obama, fear of Muslims, and comfort with white male dominance."" Trump was a natural fit, and Ailes gave him a forum to share the so-called ""birtherism"" that would launch Trump's political career and set the stage for his presidency.<br /><br />Stelter shows how Fox found the big pile of money that was available to those who could convincingly peddle the attacks and defenses that their conservative audience wanted to hear.  Sean Hannity--the college dropout who Ailes had plucked from a talk radio outlet and turned into a mega-star--was so influential with President Trump that White House aides called him the chief of staff.  Sometimes Trump would ask for Fox's Lou Dobbs to be patched in during meetings with his economic advisers.<br /><br />They were all concerned with the same thing: popularity, ratings, money and power.  Stelter shows that this was a dangerous relationship before the covid pandemic in America; after it, the relationship was literally deadly..  The more Trump spread misinformation and outright lies about the pandemic--it's cause, spread and his handling of it--the more FOX championed his actions.  It didn't matter that the evening hosts' pro-Trump commentaries were invariably false.  What mattered was telling the Trump (and Fox) ""base"" what they wanted to hear.<br /><br />Arguably, as Stelter writes, Trump and the Fox evening hosts and those on ""Fox and Friends"" have been complicit in a national tragedy that will see over 200,000 Americans killed by covid-19 by Election Day. Fox's determination to keep Americans ignorant of the danger of the virus, of Trump's gross negligence throughout the crisis, and of what people should be doing to stay safe, makes them also culpable for the deaths of thousands of people who would be alive today if they were wearing masks and social distancing. Instead of relying on experts, Trump and Hannity et al played politics--it was, after all, an election year--with devastating results. Surely, there should be some accountability, and a recognition that what Fox does--in the main--is not journalism.<br /><br />[I deducted one star because his narrative of the Trump vendetta toward Megyn Kelly omits much essential information and a timeline that puts in perspective just how dangerous a man like Donald Trump would be if given great power.  Kelly writes in her autobiography that Trump not only knew her questions ahead of time, but pressured her and her exec producer not to ask the one about his past insults to women. She refused and afterwards suspected that he had her driver slip something into a Starbucks he insisted on getting for her. She became so ill that she almost didn't go on camera that night.<br /><br />In her memoir, Kelly described how Trump targeted her for months in tweets and other public comments in an effort to get revenge  Kelly received plenty of hate mail, and Fox was so worried for her safety that they hired a bodyguard.  It ended when Ailes eventually brokered a truce--with Kelly conducting a softball interview of Trump and both of them making nice for the camera.  It's a revealing story about Trump's character and relationship with Fox that Stelter's narrative would have benefitted from including. In spite of this--and the way he shortchanges how negative Fox's impact was from Bill Clinton's last term through Obama's presidency--his book does a service. It's a sincere and detailed effort to help Americans see through the propaganda and essential dishonesty of the network and hosts they trust and turn to for an understanding of the world.]",4.0,1,2020

Best Killing Book So Far,"I know it is an overused cliche, but it really is the best to date.  I've read all the 'killing' books and this is really a top notch, easy to read and understand book of the series.  And, truly the best I have seen on the Indian wars anywhere.  Usually, when you read a book on the subject there is some kind of slant, but in true O'Reilly fashion, there is no spin here.  From the beginning you begin to realize that the wars are based on one thing:  revenge.  Each side is always trying to avenge something the other has done.  Sadly, the revenge is so total that each battle ends in torture and mutilation on the losers.  Indian leaders don't tend to be humanized in these accounts, but O'Reilly accomplishes that.  My understanding of the Native American's side of their actions are greatly understood, and the same could be said for the military leaders.  The real shame in this war is the effect it had on the real innocents, the women and children, so many deaths that should have been spared.  Truly a five star read.",5.0,1,2020
A warning about ambition and corruption--including Donald Trump's,"""For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”- Matthew 16:26<br /><br />Michael Cohen doesn’t quote Matthew, but the sentiment is a theme he repeats over and over Cohen is well aware that most people will be repulsed by the way he was able to set aside morality, kindness and integrity  in the service of Donald Trump.  Trump’s own lack of a soul as described  here is particularly frightening, given the power of the presidency.<br /><br />Cohen admits  he graduated from one of the worst law school in America. Nevertheless he was earning $750/hr pre-Trump and had been able, apparently, to make millions from New York’s tax  medallions and some real estate  purchases  and sales. He contrives  to meet Trump (my  opinion, not exactly how he puts it) by buying condos in two different locations and then choosing his side in a dispute with one of the boards.  Blind ambition.<br /><br />In this way, Cohen met the “kids” and then Trump himself and did several jobs for him—without pay—before Trump finally decided Cohen might have some of the qualities of the late largely unlamented and unethical thug who preceded him a decade earlier,, the infamous Roy Cohn.  Cohen jump into the new role  enthusiaistically for the next ten years.<br /><br />As a teen, Cohen, had some contact sand fascination with Italian majfiosa. He sees resemblance between Trump and a mob boss. (Comey and McCabe would—from two very different kinds of experiences with organized crime—also observe the same thing.) Cohen describes himself in his work for Trump, as “ one hundred percent a made man.”<br /><br />He also describes himself unsparingly as a thug, a complete opportunist, and a man whose conscience was never once bothered by what he was doing on Trump’s behalf—whether it was cheating small business owners out of money they were owed, working with the National Enquirer’s David Pecker to “catch and kill” stories about Trump grabbing women’s genitalia or arranging illegal hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels eleven days before Election Day. (Will any reporter actually ask Trump if he approved this payment? It’s against the law and he’s never actually denied it.)<br /><br />Cohen had gotten rich from New York’s taxi medallions, but wanted more money, more power, more importance and proximity to celebrity.  He wanted to feel superior to others.  He writes he was “actively, rabidly, incessantly, insistently repeated the lies and innuendo, knowing in my heart that it was wrong—but unable to stop myself.”  He described his desire to please Trump as “a cult of personality. And I loved it.”<br /><br />He describes Trump’s racism (no “n” word, but plenty of blatant racism all the same, much of it aimed at Barack Obama. Obama, fit, and some, a fine writer and orator, admired and smart—represented things that Donald Trump was not and it infuriated him.)<br /><br />Cohen describes how Trump grabbed onto the issues popular on the right and stoked racial grievance in the lie of so-called birtherism. With help from Fox news (See Brian Stelter’s Hoax) Trump became someone give serious attention for his ridiculous and divisive political expressions.  Cohen showed him a poll in mid-2011 that showed 26 percent of Republicans favored him for president. It was, Cohen says, because of birtherism. (The WHCD didn’t make Trump run, per Cohen, but it solidified his decision.)<br /><br />Trump hates Obama, and is extremely threatened by his accomplishments (he also hates Nelson Mandela, harkening back to the good old days of apartheid instead.) Cohen includes a photo of when he hired a fuax Obama impersonator  to come into Trump’s office because Trump wanted to humiliate and fire him. Bizarre? Yes. Maybe the Steele Dossier’s description of Trump and prostitutes in the Ritz Carlton Moscow was true after all. Cohen doesn’t rule it out.<br /><br />This is a quick read and, yes, a cautionary tale.  I watched Cohen’s testimony to Congress—explosive in describing Trump and the payments, and I believed him as did prosecutors. (Plus, he had cancelled checks and copies of letters). He's serving 3 years –now out of prison in home confinement now because of covid. Several of the crimes were for Trump-related actions (yes, as he told Congress under oath, “Individual 1 whom he implicated to prosecutors and in court—was, indeed “Donald J. Trump”).<br /><br />This book has a few themes—corruption of all kinds, certainly. But beyond that, Cohen is certain that Trump has so many illegal activities, so much to hide, that he will do anything—anything—to stay in office.  He  calls him dangerous, and is convincing.\<br /><br />Cohen describes a man who is angry and empty.  He has avoided accountability all his life and Cohen is convinced he will do everything possible—everything—to avoid it now, too. Will any reporter ever ask Trump about his apparent perjury to Mueller re: Stone, per Senate Intel committee?<br /><br />He includes some gossip – for example, describing Kushner (unsurprisingly) as “ supremely arrogant, a real snob, with an exaggerated sense of his importance and intelligence.” Ivanka, could be fakely friendly and pleasant, but when it came to being ruthless in serving her own financial advantage she was as unethical as her father.  Cohen took pride in doing the worst jobs for Trump, the real “dirty work”... “no matter how dishonest or dishonorable”.<br /><br />Cohen now sees himself as a former Trump cultist and watches the news of the White House staff and people like Giuliani as cult members. He tells many stories of how Trump lies—in big matters and small—and how people who know better capitulate to him.  Cohen describes how pleasing Trump – and the fear of displeasing him—took over his life for ten years.  He observed too that trump had an “unerring instinct for sycophantic yes men” like Lindsey Graham and Jim Jordan, weak men like himself, too, who could easily be co-opted. He sees in descriptions of cohen and a few others a microcosm of the larger picture—trump’s ability to completely takeover the Republican Party, leaving other politicians mostly servile and acquiescent to whatever he wants from them.<br /><br />He describes Trump unflatteringly, noting how his “grandiose sense of self importance, need for constant praise, exploitation of others without guilt or shame was the classic definition of a narcissistic sociopath.”Trump also “constantly projected his worst traits onto others”. After Trump behaved in a sleazy way toward Cohen’s 15 year old daughter “asking for a kiss and telling her in a few years he’d be dating her friends, he daughter told Cohen she was tired of creepy rich old men treating young women that way. She added that she thought her father had Stockholm Syndrome.  (From Stone, to the Trump kids to the Agalarovs etc. the only likable people in this tale are Cohen’s family—none of whom approve of Trump—but we don’t see much of them.)<br /><br />All in all, its a cautionary tale of moral corruption and ambition driven only by self-interest, a life without ideals. Not only Cohen’s but, especially, Donald Trump’s.",4.0,1,2020
"Grew up in Asheville and questioned if I would like this book, but it rang very true!!","When I first saw this book, I was skeptical, but I bought it anyway. I was raised in Asheville, and my grandfather was employed by the Biltmore Estate for many years, working in the dairy at first and later delivering milk and other dairy products around the wider Asheville community.  My parent's and grandparent's homes were just a short distance away. Biltmore Village was a part of my daily experience from birth. It is a part of so many of my personal memories, as well as those I heard from my grandparents, my mother and my uncle about their memories of the estate as they grew up. The Vanderbilts regularly held holiday gatherings for their staff and the staff members families through the years: I remember hunting Easter eggs there, and seeing the Christmas tress lit, and many such festive occasions. Yes, Mr. Vanderbilt was a product of his wealthy upbringing in many ways, but he was quite rare, as this book portrays, in his early efforts to understand ""the locals"" and certainly rare in his efforts to provide decent jobs, at decent wages, and in his ongoing efforts to see to it that people had decent housing, food, and medical care. This book did not go far enough forward in time to cover Mrs. Vanderbilt: a pity, because her focus on, and promotion of, the weaving skills (and other skills) of the local women that provided wages for many over several generations. I hope to see a subsequent book covering her many contributions to the community.  As a child, I had to have each of my baby teeth pulled since the roots did not dissolve. The reward I requested each and every time was stopping at the weaving center created by the Vanderbilts,  where for decades large looms were positioned so that visitors to the estate could watch as intricate bedspreads, coverlets,  and many other items  were woven and offered for sale. Many, many other weavers wove at home, but were able to market their work through the Biltmore Estate and Biltmore Village shops. Houses built for many of the people employed at the estate as it was built and expanded are still standing, and still occupied. Many advancements in modern forestry were promoted there and spread out to other regions of the country. So this book ""rang true"" to what my family had experienced and the stories I heard in my childhood. I was pleased to see a balanced portrayal of how hard it was for people like the Vanderbilts to understand the damage they wrought on the community on the one hand, but also  portrays their efforts to understand and assist ""the locals."" While selling the family farms was extremely difficult, it is also true that in most instances the land had been farmed to death over the generations. That, and the changes in the overall culture of the US meant that change was coming to the area whether it was wanted or not. I do believe that ultimately the good intended by G.W. Vanderbilt at least balanced the damage done by the building of the estate, and in the long run has contributed quite a lot to the development of the Asheville area. This book accurately portrays the times and the feelings of the parties involved, and is both an interesting and informative read. I truly hope there will be a sequel to this book about the later efforts within the community by both George Vanderbilt and his wife Edith.",5.0,1,2020

"Clean Language, Clean Fantasy.

Title doesn't quite fit. It's really about McGahn and Comey standing up to Trump.,"The title is a little misleading.  This really isn’t about Trump v. the United States. It’s about Trump and the Russia investigation--but particularly how two very different men (Comey and McGahn) acted as guardrails durng the investigation, standing up to Trump (in that context at least), to varying degrees.  McGahn, a true believer in Trumpism, stood up only re: obstruction of justice--but, in that, he played a key role in the information Mueller's team used, giving them nearly 1000 pages of documents without Trump's knowledge.  On the other hand, working with McConnell to push the votes and the Federalist Society to provide the conservative judges, McGahn was responsible for Trump's record number of conservative judges appointed to the federal bench--25% of them at present. These appointments satisfy his base, but are a scary thought for the rest of us as they will be there for decades to come.<br /><br />Comey's role was different from McGahn's. A Republican, he didn't vote in 2016 (feeling that voting conflicted with being FBI director). When Trump said over a private dinner, ""I need loyalty"", Comey dodged, and then documented and shared the inappropriate request with others in his leadership team.  (Two years later, Trump had successfully targeted and pushed out everyone who had been on that team.  Along with firing the FBI director himself, four months into Trump's presidency, and in the middle of Comey's 10 year term.)<br /><br />Two years later--the day after the midterm election--Trump also fired AG Jeff Sessions over the Russia investigation. Sessions, who had been part of the campaign, had recused himself from overseeing the investigation--a decision that angered Trump as being ""disloyal"" and ""not protecting me"".  Trump wanted his ""Roy Cohn""--a corrupt ""fixer"" who, in this case was hired by the American people, but would work to serve the political goals of Donald Trump.  Schmidt reminds us that Trump found his Roy Cohn--and then some, given the AG's power--when he appointed William Barr.)<br /><br />Barr spun Mueller's report with the false narrative Trump wanted, ""No collusion. No obstruction."" When Mueller had a chance to testify and lay it all out for the American public--the lies, corruption, obstruction of justice, possible criminality--he basically refused.  ""I refer you to the report"", he insisted, despite knowing that only 6% of Americans had actually read it.  And so Trump survived the biggest scandal of any presidency--cheating with a foreign adversary to win and illegally obstructing the investigation of it multiple times.  (Fortunately, he was so emboldened by Mueller's testimony, that he committed another impeachable offense the day after it, strong-arming the president of Ukraine to (1) cheat for him in falsely alleging dirt on Biden and (2) falsely exonerate Putin for cheating for him in 2016 and lie and say it was Ukraine instead.  This led to a whistleblower complaint and, finally, impeachment--even though the Republican majority in the Senate acquitted him at the trial.)<br /><br />Schmidt is more interested in looking for heroes (relatively speaking) than corruption. His section about Comey is so laudatory--a man so earnest and upright and devoted to family--that it is almost an eye-roller. Especially for those of us who still blame Comey for going beyond FBI protocol TWICE -- once, taking it on himself to announce and interpret the end of the FBI's investigation of the Clinton emails and second, 11 days before the election, very PUBLICLY reopening the investigation and undoubtedly costing her the election in such a close race (where she won by 3 million popular votes).<br /><br />Schmidt is gentle on him about it and while Comey says the usual, ""I hope it wasn't my fault"", he still sounds unable to admit that he shouldn't have been the one to announce in July (it should have been DAG, if not AG) and shouldn't have made ANY announcement so close to an election, per FBI guidelines. It was pride, hubris, that did him in, something the former religion-chemistry major should take some responsibility for.  His breaks with FBI protocol probably changed history.)<br /><br />At first, I was a little put off by just how saintly Comey comes across here (even testifying to Congress years earlier while recovering from a stage 3 diagnosis of colon cancer--and still wearing an ostomy bag while testifying!)  But then I thought, ""after being trashed publicly by the President for 3 years, including falsely smeared in tweet after tweet as a 'dirty cop', 'crooked cop, and even 'traitor', who could deserves some hagiography more than a lifelong public servant like Jim Comey?""  Schmidt's narrative might seem a little over-the-top, but Trump's attacks have really been beyond the pale.  Apparently, per Schmidt, Trump even pressured the DOJ to find a way to prosecute and ""lock up"" Comey and Clinton.  It is shocking for example, and I think new, that Sessions had John Durham (the same U.S. attorney who is now ""investigating"" those conducting the Russia investigation for Barr) ""open a leak investigation into Comey"". As Schmidt notes, ""The Trump administration was only two months old and the attorney general was already investigating the FBI director.""  As John Dean might say, ""Worse Than Watergate"".<br /><br />Cliff Simms (former comm team staff for Trump) titled his memoir of time in the WH, ""A Team of Vipers"".  But Schmidt wants to find something redeemable among all the corrupt enablers and so highlights Comey and McGahn. (And, briefly, John Kelly.  When Trump asks him to replace Comey and demands loyalty, Kelly refuses, saying ""I'm loyal to the Constitution"". Schmidt breaks this new piece of information, too)<br /><br />There are a lot of good scoops here and he frequently uses a lively first-person writing style, reminding us that he is a dogged New York Times journalist (and Pulitzer Prize winner). It's too bad the Senate intelligence committee report came out after this book.  That report confirms that the Russia investigation was well founded, not a hoax and that Trump was complicit with the Russians and WikiLeaks in welcoming what they were doing, and even requesting it (""Russia, if you're listening....).  The Republican-majority committee referred Kushner, Bannon, and Don Trump Jr. to the DOJ for investigation for possible perjury charges.  It also concluded that Trump had probably committed perjury to Mueller's team, falsely saying he was unaware of Roger Stone's contacts and coordination with Assange and the WikiLeaks email drops to benefit Trump. Perjury--yet another Trump crime going unprosecuted--and little commented on.<br /><br />Note: Schmidt does make one significant mistake in his reporting/  He says that Mueller only asked Trump questions about the campaign.  That's not true. The report makes it very clear that they also submitted written questions to him about the transition and presidency (both important re: obstruction), but Trump refused to answer any of them. And Mueller accepted that and let it go.  Just like he didn't subpoena him. And just like he didn't get his financial records. Then Mueller refused to educate Americans about the detail and scope of Trump's wrongdoing that he had found when he had the public forum to do it.<br /><br />It remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of American politics how someone can get away with so much--so many different kinds of corruption and possible crimes--as Donald Trump does, while still having so much public support. This isn't the book that lays out the extent of that corruption as I hoped it would from the title.  But he lets us see some of his own hard work tracking down sources and how these particular ones worked, largely unheralded, to try to preserve our democracy.",4.0,1,2020
A story of accomplishments--and many failures,"Weissman rewrites history here and it isn’t pretty.  Yes, the Mueller team of top-notch prosecutors unraveled many complexities of the Russian attack on the 2016 U.S. election and detailed it for the history books.<br /><br />Yes, they made it clear that there were many instances of suspicious conduct between members of the Trump campaign (and Trump himself) and Russian spies, intelligence officials/hackers, Assange and WikiiLeaks and others. It could all clearly be called “collusion” even if they didn't meet the standard of saying they could charge a crime and get a conviction.<br /><br />Anyway, it's crystal clear that Mueller was never going to prosecute a sitting president anyway. That's why Vol. 2--brimming with at least 10 instances of probable criminal obstruction of justice--didn't go anywhere either. (And I don't believe Weissman that they thought punting to Congress was the answer.  Republicans were Trump enablers, not his critics.  As with the Ukraine impeachment, no Republicans would be removing Trump from office based on a referral to Congress.)<br /><br />Weissman is a tough prosecutor who took on Enron, as well as the members of the Gambino, Columbe  and Genovese crime families—but wasn’t quite bold enough (with Mueller et al) to fully take on Donald Trump.<br /><br /> In 2016, Russian intelligence officers hacked and stole Democratic  emails.  With the help of WikiLeaks—and apparently members of the Trump campaign—they weaponized them to successfully sabotage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Much of this book –like the Mueller Report—lacks an emotional core toward its subject.<br /><br />The Russians are still here, still working to cheat for Trump, although iit seems no one wants to talk with the public about it. (See pp. 116-118 of Woodward’s book “Rage” for just one alarming interference with actual voting in Florida).  If Chris Wray gets out a sentence or two to Congress, he quickly finds Trump tweeting about replacing him.  The ability of Donald Trump to intimidate people who, unlike him, respect the law and the Constitution continues to be astonishing.<br /><br />What are they so afraid of?<br /><br />That’s the question I had reading Weissman’s book. (“Where the Law Ends, Tyranny Begins” is a quote from John Locke.  If only the outrage  and passion of this quote had informed this book..)<br /><br />Weissman wishes they’d done more—subpoenaed Trump perhaps. They didn’t subpoena Don Jr and Ivanka either because they were afraid Trump would get mad and shut them down.<br /><br />But mostly his criticism of Mueller, an icon to so many, is lip-service. At worst, he was “naive” when Barr, a personal friend, intercepted the report with his own misleading “summary” of it.  Barr is the villain of the piece—not even Trump who also deserves to be. (Weissman does little to document the truly bizarre and disturbing tirades of a sitting president against those involved in this investigation.)  Weissman corrects some of the President's lying (for example, about Strzok and Page, who disliked Trump but never leaked to the press about the investigation. It was only Clinton who was hurt by the FBI--McCabe's leak about the Clinton Foundation and Comey's mishandling of her email investigation--twice.) He takes some of the halo off of Comey  Trump always fails to mention that nothing came out about his campaign members being investigated until after the election was over.<br /><br />Considering the incredible story they uncovered—probably the greatest espionage coup in history—it  is a rather lackluster read.  (And why no indictment of Manafort for conspiracy?  That investigation was Weissman's job. Repeatedly giving campaign polling data to a Russian spy wasn't conspiratorial enough? With Russians weaponizing social media with micro-targeting?  The Trump Tower meeting with a representative from the Russian government promising to ""help"" Trump win wasn't enough?<br /><br />Not questioning Veselnetskaya and Don Jr and Ivanka was really inexcusable (the former may have been unavailable in Russia, but the Trumps weren't questioned for fear of upsetting their father.)<br /><br />The recent Senate intelligence report said Trump lied to Mueller about not knowing Roger Stone was an intermediary to WikiLeaks. (Very obvious from Bannon and Gates,, too.)  And they referred Kushner, Don Jr. and Bannon to the DOJ for investigation of lying under oath. More potential consequences than the Mueller team gave them.<br /><br />And Mueller allowed Trump to not only answer questions in writing (with lawyers) but to ignore most of them.  He answered -some- of the written questions about the campaign.  And refused to answer ANY questions about the transition or his presidency. Even then, per the Senate report, he lied to them about Stone.  But they let him refuse to answer anything he didn't want to answer (most of it).  What were these Mueller team prosecutors so afraid of?<br /><br />Weissman doesn't mention the worst thing Mueller did, the greatest failure of all. Yes, Rosenstein prohibited them from following the money to see if Trump was compromised, and shut down the investigation into that that McCabe had (courageously imo) opened.  And, yes, Barr sabotaged them and lied to the public about their conclusions before they could see the real report.<br /><br />But Mueller had a second chance to let Americans know what they had really found when he appeared in Congress.  By then, there was no fear of being fired.  Nothing but deference to the DOJ and President to prevent Mueller from laying out the facts of what they had found.<br /><br />Instead of educating the public, Mueller refused to answer Democrats' questions. ""If it's in the report, I concur,"" he would say, over and over.  He was willing to talk about the Russians, but not about the Trump campaign or Trump himself and how he repeatedly obstructed the investigation.  Mueller could have laid it all on camera and correct Barr-Trump for repeatedly lying about it.  But he refused to do so.<br /><br />He wouldn't even read excerpts from the report on camera when asked. .No wonder the following day, Trump called Ukraine and strong-armed the president to (1) announce a (false) investigation of Joe Biden and (2) announce that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered iin 2016--and had done it for Clinton, not Trump.. In this way, Trump could cheat to win again-- could attack a political opponent and also exonerate both himself and Putin for sabotaging Clinton's campaign.  (Weissman, bizarrely, says Trump wanted Ukraine to say they had interfered in 2016 for TRUMP.  Not true, and it doesn't even make sense.  Trump told the Ukrainian president (Zelensky) to say that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the U.S. election for HILLARY CLINTON.  That it hadn't really been Putin sabotaging the Clinton campaign in order to help Trump. As usual, Trump  was defending and protecting Putin, in order to falsely exonerate him--and, of course, to exonerate himself from encouraging and ""welcoming"" Putin for cheating on Trump's behalf.  Trump never let up on lying about what happened in the 2016 election and calling all the evidence about connections between hiis campaign and Russians/WikiLeaks ""a hoax"" and a ""witchhunt"".  He even, bizarrely, would accuse Obama, Biden, McCabe, Comey and others of ""treason"" Mueller could have spoken out and told the public the truth about Trump and Russia, but he failed to do it. Was he afraid of destabilizing the presidency?  Subservient to authority or the GOP?  The opportunity to be a truth-teller was there, when he went to Congress, and in that moment, Mueller failed his country.))<br /><br />Weissman is sorry that they didn’t try harder to let Americans know that the president probably illegally obstructed the investigation at least 10 times. (Side note: Volume 2 was easier to read than Vol 1.  But constantly referring to “the president” and never “Trump” gave it an unnecessarily deferential tone that weakened the criticism of the conduct being described.  Why not write it like history, hold Trump accountable by actually using his name?)<br /><br />Weissman has his own chance to summarize their work here, and he doesn't take it either.  I know it was all in the report (448 pages) but a couple of summary pages would help people who he knows are never going to read it. It’s what Mueller also could have done in Congress—to even greater effect—but refused to.<br /><br />Weissman seems to want the responsibility to lie with Barr. But they all seem so intimidated and inhibited by Trump.  It makes you wonder: What if they hadn’t been?  What if they did subpoena...indict...be fired... or have a court fight?  Couldn't all of that have educated the public, perhaps outraged them as well?  It could have made a stand for justice, at least, a stand against corruption, cheating with an adversary and coverup from Trump that seems so much worse than Watergate.<br /><br />Even if Trump continued his ongoing ""Saturday Night Massacre""-style obstruction, by taking a stand, Mueller & Co could have  given a lesson about the Constitution and the limits of presidential power for the history books.  Instead, Mueller, Weissman & Co had taken on terrorists, crooked corporations like Enron and the toughest crime families in America, but were unable or unwilling to take on the president of the United States, even if it was someone like Donald Trump.",3.0,0,2020
More Like Non-Fiction with a Little Bit of Fiction in the Mix,"Jodi Picoult’s newest book was really different from anything that I have read by her before.  Instead of being a fiction book with a little bit of background history if needed, this one was more like a study of Egyptology with a story as the background.  I was mired deeply into all of the facts about tombs, long names of Egyptian rulers and how to read hieroglyphics.  And that wasn’t in a good way!  Sometimes, I felt lost in the tombs of ancient Egypt and was ready for the story to move along.  The plot was about Dawn, a death doula, and her relationship with her husband Brian and her former lover Wyatt.  Most of the plot was entertaining, but again, the endless repetitive details!  And the subconscious of Dawn when a plane crashes was also hard to follow what was happening.  If you are a fan of Picoult, you may enjoy this book, but it wasn’t my favorite by a long shot.  It seemed to be promoting her son’s interest in Egyptology instead of her readers’ interest in her usually fascinating stories.  I did enjoy reading about Dawn’s occupation and how she helped people slip from life into death in the most comfortable way possible.  This book is not exactly historical fiction, but it has a lot of history in it so I’m not sure how to classify it.<br />Disclaimer<br />Disclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

Mary Trump describes a villain here—but it’s not who you think,"“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" Mary Trump doesn’t quote Tolstoy’s famous introductiion to “Anna Karenina” but she could have. Even though she’s writing about the family of the 45th president of the United States, these people are a mess.<br /><br />Sometimes the effect of her descriptions is comical (oh, that family Christmas!). More often, it’s tragic—with the ultimate tragedy, in her telling, being that a “sociopath”--her grandfather, self-made multi-mlllionaire Fred Trump—destroyed the lives of his children. Particularly, she blames him for all of her father Fred Jr. ""Freddy"" Trump's failures and for his alcoholism-related heart attack at 42.<br /><br />Even though she sees Donald as being a narcissist and sociopath like Fred, she finds a way to blame Fred Trump for that, too. And Donald’s ruthlessness and lack of empathy, even as president, are also traced back to Fred.. She writes, ”Ironically, the defenses Donald had developed as a young child to protect himself against the indifference, fear and neglect that had defined his early years, along with his being forced to watch the abuse of Freddy primed him to develop what is older brother clearly lacked: the ability to be the “killer” and proxy his father required.”<br /><br />Donald’s mother tells Mary something that’s more in line with my speculation about why Donald is the way he is:  He was ""always a spoiled brat"". Even Donald's written about how he bullied his younger brother Robert from a very early age, stealing his blocks and gluing them together, threatening to break his favorite toys, etc.  By fourteen, Donald was so difficult, that his parents sent him to a military-style boarding school (the siblings called it a “reform school”).<br /><br />Donald was at NYMA for 4 years, from 14-18, a time that I've always wondered about--especially given the tough physical punishment--but which Mary writes nothing about.<br /><br />She really doesn't KNOW much about Donald's childhood--wasn't there--hasn't talked with him about it either. She didn't spend much time with her father, isn't that close with her relatives, but does hear some reminiscences from her aunt and probably second-hand from Mary's own mother (she and Freddy divorced after he pulled a rifle on her when Mary was 5.)<br /><br />She also doesn't know much about Donald's college years (beyond getting his smart older sister to do his homework and paying someone to take the SAT for hm.)  Cheating was natural for him, even then.<br /><br />It seems beyond question that Fred Trump treated hs charming, affable, fun-loving eldest son with contempt.  Freddy was too soft, kind and “weak”, not a “killer”.  Freddy tried working with him for three years, suffering from his father’s contempt and withering criticism. Finally, he quit, going on to become a commercial pilot (for years, Fred had financed his “rich young man” life style—nice clothes, luxury cars, a boat and flying lessons.<br /><br />In his mid-20s, Freddy became a pilot for TWA. Donald and Fred mocked him as being a ""bus driver"", but to the world at large, he's glamorous, successful, with a wife and the first of two children. (He still also has a trust fund from his father.) Then -- after ten months-- he's fired because of his alcoholism.  How is that his father's fault?<br /><br />Anyway, he returns to work for Fred, whose father was also an alcoholic (Fred, like Donald, doesn't drink.).  Mary has empathy for Freddy...for Donald....but none at all for Fred Trump, who, yes, sounds like a bigot and a jerk, but he had a tough childhood, stepping up when his father died and Fred was only 12.  He started doing construction while still in high school, supporting his mother, and putting his brother through college. (John Trump became a top physicist and professor. Mary doesn't even mention him).<br /><br />After graduating, Donald goes to work for Fred and unlike his brother, it suits hm. But Mary's bitter about Donald's  compatibility with Fred, who makes Donald president of the Trump Organization at 24 while her father does work that Mary feels is beneath him.  She describes Donald's move to Manhattan to try to expand the company there as “driven by a chauffeur whose salary his father’s company paid...Donald’s job description seems to have included lying about his ‘accomplishments' and allegedly refusing to rent apartments to black people.”<br /><br />A major weakness of this book is that, as his niece, she really doesn't know much about Donald Trump from personal experience,  Even when he hired her to write his second book, ""The Art of the Comeback"", he wouldn't really talk to her about it. (He once handed her 10 dictated pages for it--""really great!""--that turned out to be demeaning comments about famous women who'd refused to date him.)  When she didn't prove adept at just making up insights and life experiences for ""his"" book, he fired her.<br /><br />This is not really about experiences and conversations with her uncle Donald.  It would take me about 5 minutes to tell you every personal interaction she describes with him,<br /><br />Mainly it's about how bad Fred Trump was, how her father suffered, and her own struggles to get her inheritance.  (She takes for granted all the things Fred did pay for through the years. There's an entitlement running through this--a feeling of not getting enough money, and not appreciating what she did get--or how the parents tried to help Freddy.  may be unavoidable when you're related to an exceptionally rich man, but that doesn't make it any less annoying.  In an interview, she sud the family suffered from ""learned helplessness"".  Again, this is kind of privileged whining--an explanation that still blames others for your own bad choices, and puts yourself as the victim because of them.  (Sound familiar?)<br /><br />Donald's presidency has given her a good reason to write this--and more things to say about him than she would have had in 2016. She explains his deficiencies as president as the result of his life-long character deficiencies that were enabled and indulged by his family and by ""being the boss"" at the Trump Org.  Everyone always indulges his delusions of superiority (she calls the omnipresent coddling,  ""being institutionalized"") and observes that it continues in the White House where he's surrounded by sycophants.<br /><br />Mary believes that if Donald Trump is reelected “American democracy will be over”, and the last part of the book lays out the reasons for it.<br /><br />Many good writers about Trump—Tony Schwartz, Tim O’Brien among them—have called this an important book.  I’m glad it is getting attention, but it seems really over-hyped for what she actually knows. I just didn’t love it like I expected.",3.0,0,2020
The book that changed my life,"Wow.  This is a fantastic children's chapter book.  I think this is more for older elementary school/ middle school as some of the content is heavy.  As an adult, I can tell you that I laughed and cried at different points of this story. I loved how the underlying theme of kindness and ultimately how kindness can change lives.  The mother in this story is nasty, but a mother can come in many forms.  Great characters.  Nice setting.  Lovely read.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Content:  Ada, the main character, is severely abused--verbally, physically, and emotionally.  This is heavy but handled well by the author.<br />Language: Clean<br />Religious: No.  There are some parts where the kids go to church.  But this is not religious.<br /><br />Happy reading!!",5.0,1,2020

A very poor retelling of Verne's classic,"I don't know what has happened to Greig Beck.  He started off so well, with great stories, characters, writing and pacing.  And then... wham. Dud after dud after dud.  With TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (TTCOTE) , he has reached a nadir.  It can't possibly get worse than this.<br /><br />TTCOTE is a retelling of Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  Same plot, same story line but without any semblance of reality with respect to the science, the characters or the resolution.  Even the writing has deteriorated from early Beck novels.  In one sentence a character has a half stick of dynamite, in the next it has turned into a quarter of a stick. Plain is misspelled (or missed) as plane, verse is substituted for versus, tense mismatches from sentence to sentence.  Wow a complete disaster.<br /><br />Unlike the PRIMORDIA trilogy that was also very closely based on a 100 year old novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, (and that was excellent), TTCOTE covers no new ground of any consequence.  The characters all act so stupidly that it is a wonder that any of them can tie their shoes.  Just like in the original, a group of cavers (rather than explorers) follows a mysterious text describing a previous journey to the center of the earth.  This time the text is Russian, and the ancient explorer was Arkaday Saknussov instead of Arne Saknussemm (misspelled by Beck).  Saknussov was allegedly the model for Verne's Saknussemm.  Anyway, this group (actually two groups) prepares for a descent into the world's deepest cave somwhere in Russia, after meeting the only survivor of a similar attempt in the early 1970s who warns them of horrors beyond belief. So naturally, they set off with no weapons, no compass, no camera, absolutely nothing more than standard caving gear.  And a minimal amount of that.<br /><br />Beck invents something called ""gravity wells"" that make no sense at all.  The group leader (apparently the only one out of all these geniuses that has even heard of Jules Verne's classic) explains that Earth's ""...gravity is a function of its mass, core and it's rotation.""  Uh, no it's not.  It's only mass that counts. But who's counting? Anyway, these gravity wells are super long channels in which objects float. OK.  But then when our intrepid and unprepared explorers dive into one, something (never explained) makes them accelerate *downwards* to 250 mph.  At journey's end, the survivors find another gravity well where objects float but this time when they enter the well, the accelerate *upwards* at 250 mph.<br /><br />It not only the science that's stupid, so are the explorers.  Early on one of them finds a funky looking pool of algae infested water and decides to drink it, even after warnings from his smarter pals.  So of course he ends up exploding  from the giant fungal colony growing inside him. The rest leave him to grow there without a second of emotion.  And he's only mentioned once more in the novel.  Later, another of the bright boys sees a strange fruit and decides to eat it, apparently no knowing that such things as poisonous plants exist.  It turns out to burn the hell out of his mouth, costing him two molars in the process.<br /><br />In sum, Beck manages the trifecta of a ripped off plot, nonsensical science and stupid characters with some poor writing for dessert.  You've been warned.  Stay Away.<br /><br />Strongly not recommended.<br /><br />JM Tepper",1.0,0,2020
Not worth it! Annoying! Maybe Atomic Waste?,"I barely made it through 1/3 of the book. Reading it as an audiobook, I found it very repetitive and monotonous. As I read, and as the author spoke of methods and mental operations, my mind was drawn to two books that I read decades ago: [[ASIN:0143111884 Psycho-Cybernetics]] and [[ASIN:0061122432 Addiction and Grace]], both written by medical doctors, both which explain things like habits and their formation in a way that has stayed with me all these years. In contrast, I remember little of what I read in this book, maybe because it was so annoying and kept making me think of what I learned long ago.",1.0,0,2020
SYMPATHY FOR SOVIET SPY,"I am an uncritical fan of Ben MacIntyre but this book reflects a certain modern liberal zeitgeist .Sonya was for decades in the service of a regime and an ideology of unimaginable evil--one which we were forced to look the other way in WW2. Can one imagine any author or any publisher coming within a mile of any book which detailed with some sympathy the life of a Nazi spy? Well yes Hitler was bad but these Nazi idealists were trying to  create a ""new kind of man"". She contributed to the deaths and enslavement of millions of people by working to support Stalinism. Much later she regrets. Yes Stalin was bad but she did not return her medals or seriously make amends, living out her final years in East Germany, for God's sake! Her abetting of Klaus Fuchs is actually indirectly excused by MacIntyre as somehow preventing war by evening up the East/West power balance! Fuchs got 13 years, the Rosenbergs got the chair. Western Liberals seem constitutionally unable  to get beyond:Russia was a nightmare but somehow their Western dupes had their hearts in the right place. NB:Notice that Trump is always Hitler, never Stalin.",4.0,1,2020
It was great until the end,"I’ve read many of Mr. Coben’s books and have never been this disappointed..<br /><br />The storyline is actually very interesting.  The main characters are a man who as a boy, was left in the woods by someone, a 70 yr old criminal attorney who knows just the right questions to ask, a politician who will do anything to get elected, two teenagers and an ultra rich couple.<br /><br />A teenager goes missing.  The there’s another ...  the storyline proceeds with drama, suspense, the usual twists and turns and would have ended on a great note if one didn’t have the read the chapter “three weeks later.”  I know you’ll read it even if I say not to.  But it wrecks the whole book.  If it weren’t on my iPad, I would have torn out that chapter or just simply stomped on the book, tore the whole thing up and set it on fire.<br /><br />The ending is stupid, nonsensical and ridiculous.  It doesn’t even belong in the story.  Mr. Harlan Coben, you are much better than this!",1.0,0,2020
"First half needs more editing, gift book for the impossible to buy for, important topic","Reader: Ivy League PhD in Engineering and IT.  Non-academic, half as old as dirt.  Two degrees of separation from the people and events of the book.  Kindle version.<br /><br />Good news:<br /><br />1. The second half of the book is tight and fact-rich.  The information technology content throughout was well-written and at just the right level for the audience and topic.  The author tried valiantly, and generally succeeded, to make this important but dry topic interesting.<br />2. This is a gift book for the sort of person who is impossible to buy for: 60+ white collar/intellectual, preferably from/in the Boston-DC corridor or the SF Bay Area.  The older the better.  If Republican, send nose plugs.  There’s a gratuitous undertone of “how in the world could the wonderful Democrats lose election X” to some of the discussion.<br />3. This book acknowledges something of crucial importance for American culture.  Events 50 years and older are history and we should be treating them as such.  Trillions of dollars were spent by funding agencies on Cold War research.  Those funders, the actual people, and researchers are getting old and starting to age out.  Modulo intelligence concerns, these stories should be captured.  Doomed to repeat failures and the like.<br /><br />Bad news:<br /><br />The first half ambled in areas of political economics and Cold War military posture outside of the author’s expertise.  Stylistically, the first half reads like a group of 20-something research assistants wrote drafts of portions of the book and it was cobbled together by the author.  Let’s call it tenured-sloppy.  Not just pandemic-sloppy.  I’ve noticed some late-career writings by some tenured humanities academics, especially “golden rolodex’ types, share this disjointed and self-indulgent style.  In the Chronicle of Higher Education, the author bemoans the humanities crisis, saying fixing it is easier said than done.  Well, think global and act local.  Get your cronies to establish an editorial process to correct this understandable and natural but malodorous trend.  You (the royal you) are too tenured to be effectively managed by your acolytes and peers without some structure within your discipline.  You have to police yourselves.  There are only so many crotchety independent old snarks like me willing to complain.<br /><br />Doubt the direct words of Harvard 20-somethings in this?  Here’s what I learned from the first half of the book:<br /><br />1. The tenured Harvard history professor author believes “humanity would, by the twenty-first century, find itself trapped and tormented: stripped bare, driven to distraction, deprived of its senses, interrupted, exploited, directed, connected and disconnected, bought and sold, alienated and coerced, confused, misinformed, and even governed.”  I interpret the author as stating all of humanity has been in this state for 20 years.  This sounds like 20-something hyperbole to me.  Allen Ginsburg would have loved it.  Allen Ginsburg was a poet, not a historian.<br />2. The author really doesn’t like Richard Nixon.  The author blurts out negative comments about Nixon irrelevant to the thesis of the book like a sufferer from political Tourette’s syndrome.  Maybe Checkers bit her ankle as a child.<br />3. McCarthy activities went after “supposed Communist subversives”.  Not “actual and supposed”, just “supposed”.  How in the world did they avoid the actual?  And the author thinks McCarthy himself was a poopy-head.  That’s about all the information presented.  It isn’t mentioned whether he had a dog.<br />4. The author really likes John F Kennedy.  “The election of John F. Kennedy to the White House in 1960 became the stuff of myth and legend. It carries an air of destiny.”  #MeToo doesn’t exist in the author’s universe.  Just womanizing.  The cad.  The dreamy, dreamy cad.  Wait a minute, the author is from Harvard, and Harvard is in...do you think there’s a little tribal signaling by the young bloods going on?  Nah.<br />5. A historian will quote passages *from novels* of the period *about fictional characters* to support a thesis about real people and events.  Several times.  A tenured professional historian.  This topic has available more than just living memory of what participants had said.  Many of the people tangentially involved are still alive and have most of their own teeth.<br />6. Women students at top colleges wore “skirts and baby blue eye shadow and midnight black mascara” and would look up at a male professor longingly.  There was no citation from the period, not even to a Harlequin romance novel, to support this assertion.  And I’m certain there is absolutely no projection going on here by 20-somethings.<br />7. A UC-Berkeley protester in the 1966 ""cried out to a crowd aching to hear an indictment of the age of the machine, his voice rasping with exhaustion” over a ban on handing out pamphlets on a specific 25 foot brick walkway on campus.  Out of a two square mile campus.  And they say over-wrought 20-something purple prose is dead.<br />8. In the early 1960s, IBM would, upon request, step in and deliver a number of “girls” on Election Night since the “girls” (always in quotes, a signature move by tenured Harvard professors) actually knew how to operate all the equipment.  (Get your minds out of the gutter.)<br />9. You can do a hatchet job on a man suffering from mental illness and his long-suffering wife and, if you are labeled a historian and the man is dead, get away with it.  On the side of the Great Divide the author temporarily resides.  That’s an “early scholar” kind of move.<br />10. The Greenfields “would sometimes head up to Cambridge, to visit the Pools on Irving Street, by the Schlesingers and the Galbraiths. Jean Pool loved Patty Greenfield; they’d catch up in the kitchen. America’s most beloved chef, Julia Child, lived next door, at 103 Irving Street; she was close with Jean.”  We get it, you live in Cambridge.  Does a tenured Harvard professor do this?  No, they’d name drop Cabots and Lowells.  Plebeians.<br />11. “Everything in the [1950s and 1960s American] culture told [Bill McPhee] that great men had to be bastards.”  Everything.  Christian culture, rural and agricultural culture, Hispano culture, Pueblo culture, Navajo culture, New England Yankee culture, Black culture, Asian culture, Jewish culture, Appalachian culture, Scandinavian culture, Women’s culture all pointed to that, according to the author.  I respectfully disagree.  And I also submit that all those facets are part of “the culture”, and always have been...even in the 1950s and 1960s America.  Anything less is just a 2020 cartoon version of what America was, *even to America itself at the time*.  Well, maybe that cartoon version was and is alive and well for Harvard 20-somethings.<br />12. “Stewart Brand broke the story of the coming computer revolution”, presumably in the same universe that Al Gore invented the Internet.  History, please, not just your parents’ personal history.  Thumbs up for mention of the great Whole Earth Catalog.<br />13. “Affairs, and fights, and recriminations” were to be expected when white social scientists and their families stayed at beaches.  In fact, the author asserts it would only have been noteworthy if they didn’t.  No mention of whether police were alerted in advance.  #BlackLivesMatter should take note.<br />14. Male social scientists of the period “really were crapped up: haunted by the war, deluded by Freud, trapped in terrible straits, raised to be strong but not brutal, astute but imperturbable, lines so easy to cross.”  I’ve heard that some of the 60000 young American soldiers who died in rice patties and the like in Vietnam, with their last breath expressed those exact same regrets about those tragic social scientists.  I sense 20-something Harvard.  Couldn’t find “crapped up” in DSM-V...perhaps a misspelling by the tenured Harvard professor.<br />15. “Eisenhower was a liberal.”  No question?  Revealed wisdom?  Something a 20-something would just throw out, and a professional tenured historian would say a bit more.<br />16. There isn’t such a thing as an “ill-advised tennis match’’ not involving Bobby Riggs to someone the age of a Harvard tenured professor.<br />17. “Hinkle-pinkle!’  (OK, Hinkle-pinkle is cute.)<br /><br />PS: When the author publishes a Kindle book, someone should make in-text references directly link to the attached reference section.  And skip the index on a Kindle book.  It’s 2020.<br /><br />PPS: there might be a misquote of sorts about an honorary Harvard doctorate recipient in the book.  The original quote sort of came out of nowhere in the text...one of the few current references.<br /><br />[“How do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service?” Zuckerberg blinked three times, apparently shocked that Hatch could know so little about so basic a matter. “Senator,” he said, “we run ads.”]<br /><br />might also be described as<br /><br />[“How do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service?” Zuckerberg *winked* three times, apparently shocked that Hatch could *ask out loud* about so basic a matter. “Senator,” he said *averting a knowing glance*, “we...run ads.”]<br /><br />Tomato, tomahto...generally better not to present interpretations of thoughts and intentions of living people without actual supporting evidence.  For example, asking them directly and reporting their response.  Maybe with commentary from others.  If it’s current, it’s journalism, not the free-form half-novels of history.<br /><br />PPPS: I’m keeping hinkle-pinkle and the author can’t have it.  My new favorite word...",4.0,1,2020
No way can you guess the ending,"I stayed up and read the whole book in one sitting, with a couple of breaks and a dinner in the middle.  Interesting.  Intriguing.  Excellent ending.<br /><br />What I found difficult was learning the names of a whole town of people.  I wish the author at least had pictures of the people, which would have been easier.  Now I can visualize a map of the town and where they lived, with the different families and their pictures.  That would really have helped me get into the story better.  On one level the story is very emotional and deep into the town's characters, and on another level, you have to remain logical just to keep track of the people of the town.  But then again, the whole story is about trying to figure out who-done-it - who stabbed the father and why.<br /><br />I loved the way the story was told.  Initially, you see people's reactions, but you learn more and more about the town and the history of the people growing up in the town as the story progresses, and along the way find out why.  I found the people to be very interesting and diverse.<br /><br />I especially liked the Facebook chat group the town has.  So real to life with some people being asses, some moderating influences, and everyone speculating why.  I thought it added to the story.<br /><br />But really, the story is about one family and their secrets, which unfold over the story, and leads to a much happier ending once the secrets are out.

this is more a memoir than a true crime book,"Bought this based on a NYT review, so I have only myself to blame. The author is a navel-gazer who is shocked, absolutely shocked, that the justice system is deeply flawed. Like so many outsiders she fell in love with Appalachia. As a former criminal defense investigator, I found nothing too unusual about the bungled investigation by short-sighted cops and prosecutors. A completely unsympathetic man was falsely convicted. It happens every day. This is a memoir with maybe 15% devoted to the crime, investigations, and trials. If you want to read a memoir by someone with an agenda, buy the book, but anyone looking to read the true crime genre should skip it unless you want to read about the author's alcohol and intimacy problems.",2.0,0,2020
A mediocre story tackling contemporary issues...,"I chose this as my March First Reads selection through Amazon.<br /><br />In the author's notes at the end of the book, Loretta Nyhan mentioned that more and more people she knew were being diagnosed with autoimmune disorders. I could literally go on a tirade about the science and main cause behind these disorders, but I won't. Nevertheless, reading about Ally running from doctor to doctor trying to find answers and not getting any at all...it was beyond frustrating to me, mostly because it's so accurate. Doctors really are that ignorant. Or, at least they pretend to be. (Please don't assume your doctor is all-knowing. Truly. Do your research...and I don't mean Google. I mean get actual medical books and research. Not only am I an RN who works with docs and realizes they're absolutely fallible, I'm also a mom who has corrected them on multiple occasions.)<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />The Other Family is a cutesy story revolving around themes of chronic illness, adoption, divorce, alternative medicine (which I loved) and the myriad of emotions that go along with each. The characters were full of depth, but the story itself seemed lacking to me somehow. It felt as though it just skimmed the surface of each topic, never really digging down deep. It is a quick, easy read...I finished it in one evening, so if you're looking for something which doesn't require much thought or brainpower, this is a good choice.<br /><br />Overall, this was a mediocre read. I'd recommend it to those who love domestic dramas, or are just looking for something light to fill a slow afternoon.",3.0,0,2020
Where is Ms. Hilderbrand?,"Normally, I would not bother writing a 2 star review.  However, there are so many Hilderbrand readers that I wanted them to know that this book is not what you would expect from her. I have always much preferred her books set on Nantucket, but as I had read the first two books in the ""paradise series,"" I wanted to know how it all ended. The writing style is so different from the usual - is she emulating USA Today, James Patterson? The characters are flat with no depth, no development.  It is all facts, name dropping of places on St. John, superficial plot filled with romantic angst, which all ended up as predictable. Perhaps if you had visited St John, you would appreciate the locale.  I didn't feel as though I had been there. This is about what I expected, but it was disappointing nonetheless and fairly costly as that. If I had not read 28 Summers recently, I would have thought that Ms. Hilderbrand had lost her muse.  That book, however, was a delight, a worthy addition to her long list of books.  I hope she ditches this staccato plot driven style and returns to giving the reading something to feel, to remember, and to empathize with her characters and their situations.

"Family Secrets and Lots of Romance, Too","Mary Ellen Taylor has written a book about the ties between generations, secrets, losses, resentment and regret.  I assumed when I started reading this book that it would be a light and sweet romance with little conflict.  I was so wrong!  I was drawn quickly into the story because of the setting in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where I was raised.  I understood the struggles of young Sadie, trying to help her family to survive any way she can, especially with the secret family recipe of adding honeysuckle to the white lightning that is the family’s main source of income.  Sadie is one of the narrators during the time period set in the 1940’s.  Fast forward to the current day and the narrator is Libby, a young woman who is aching over the loss of her husband and their dream of having children.  Libby is pursuing a new career in photography and it is that job that leads her to Elaine Grant, the owner of Woodmont, a fancy mansion that is perfect for having weddings on its grounds.  Elaine introduces Libby to the groundskeeper and handyman Colton and therein lies the hint of romance.  There were so many secrets in this book, and the author did a fabulous job of weaving the tale of the main characters and how all of their stories were connected.  This is a generational story that was a very satisfying read, but I must say that I want to read more of the story.  There was an ending, of course, and it did bring the story to a conclusion.  But I think that there are more stories to be told in these secretive mountains.

"Great Story, But (literally) Hard to Read","What a wonderful story about a 71 year-old man who is tasked with escorting a 10 year-old girl liberated from captivity to her only living relatives. The man is Captain Kidd, retired from the U.S. Army, having served in the Civil War and other 19th century wars.  He makes his living traveling from town to town where he charges attendees ten cents to hear him  read stories from newspapers around the globe, hence the title, ""News of the World.""  He is asked by army personnel to transport a young girl who was kidnapped by Kiowa Indians at the age of six, and who has lived with them (happily for four years) to her aunt and uncle in the Texas Territory. The young girl speaks the native tongue, but not English.  The story touches on many important themes, including the poor relationship with native Americans, the growing biases against freed slaves, and the political unrest in the Texas Territory.  The trip is a perilous one in which they encounter outlaws and  human traffickers wanting to buy the young girl.  They are also befriended along the way.  Paulette Jiles  provides so many layers of enjoyment for the readers of this book.  I absolutely adore the character of Captain Kidd.  The reason I said in my review's title that it was ""hard to read"" was not because of the book's sad themes, but because of the lack of quotation marks in conversations. Reading so much lively dialogue among the characters without the use of quotation marks affects my brain as if I were reading a string of run on sentences. It was literally ""hard to read.""  I had to reread many paragraphs to grasp who was saying what to whom.  It turned a five-star book into a three-star for me.",3.0,0,2020
"Wild ride, not too racy, MUST READ!","Wow!!! I LOVE this book and it's first sequel, Burn, Baby, Burn. There also is another sequel coming!!! I can hardly wait!<br />If you like books about mortals, super mortals, paranormals, mages, etc. and aren't offended by an 'unexpected' version of an angel, this book is absolutely for you! If you're offended, you might want to move on.<br />These books have been one of my all time favorite reads!!! I am definitely going to turn my mom onto them. She is a big Stephanie Plum fan, and is fine with the later books, so I think she will enjoy this. Oh, and so far, the sex has been very tame, so I can share this with her without embarassment!",5.0,1,2020
No solutions?,"Racism is one of the evil sides of humanity. I do not believe it is as simple as it is portrayed in this book. It is complex with numerous roots. It will never be eradicated. I have found even the kindest, most loving individuals display some racist tendencies. Racism lives in all of us regardless of skin color. Humanity finds anyone who is different to be dangerous, distrustful, well, simply different and therefore suspicious. Most of us try to look beyond this suspicion and accept others based on their actions. Unfortunately, too many do not, can not, or are unwilling to do so. Personal gain seems to be a major reason for this unwillingness.<br />The book gave great background on racism. It, however, posed no solutions.",3.0,0,2020
"Oh, Shuggie","I’m left emotionally exhausted as this story comes to an end.<br />One way I rate a book is by whether or not I worry about the characters when I’m not reading it, if I find myself wondering what they’re doing while I’m at work or going about my daily business.<br />Shuggie and his family were often on my mind and I couldn’t wait to be reunited with them in the evenings when my day was done. Being a mother myself I wanted to rescue Shuggie from his own. I could almost feel the heaviness and smell the odor of the Bain house. I wanted to get them all out of there. Now mind you, I don’t believe in violence but oh my Lord I sure wanted to outright punch more than a few of the people who were responsible for Agnes’ drinking, including her, at times. So do you see how involved I became in their lives, how concerned I was? Read this book and you will too.",5.0,1,2020
One of a kind,"Before I found this book I remember thinking to myself, why isn't there a learn-to-draw book where you learn to draw the whole figure in stages, you know, instead of head on p. 20, hand on p. 160? Well, here it is! The problem with those other drawing books is most people will never have the discipline to make it all the way through, and, you're ""learning"" complex disparate processes individually then never returning to them, like cramming for an exam and then forgetting everything. Research shows intervallic review is the most effective learning technique. Here, you return to each area of the body in each stage and learn to draw them with increasing detail; this allows you to repeatedly return to your process of drawing each part and retain more of the information while ever increasing your sophistication and precision. This too is far more enjoyable and comforting because you're putting in work on all the parts in a relatively short time period and improving at drawing the whole body, rather than literally having to work for years on heads and torsos and limbs before even getting around to drawing hands and feet. The only issue for me is I make dolls--girl dolls--and most the figures in this book are men. Despite the drawn women on the front and back cover, all the photos inside are male, and I counted less than ten pages devoted to obviously female features. I'll have to get back to my big anatomical drawing books after this to improve my knowledge of feminine attributes, but I think this method is giving me the confidence to finally tackle those tomes. This is the most accessible method I've found, with a pleasurable easy-to-follow style; it keeps you motivated and hopefully leads to bigger and better things!<br />UPDATE:<br />Having completed all the exercises in this book, I can attest the above-stated appeal is utterly superficial. However alluring the fleshing-out and starting-with-the-basics system is, the book rapidly loses track of its own pedagogical approach. When it begins, the text and description matches the pictures and exercises, and one can internalize the figurative concepts and reproduce them spontaneously with individualized alterations from imagination--the goal of the artist. But quickly the descriptions deteriorate from matching the example drawings very specifically to vaguely generally, and one is left copying strange lines and shapes that are the author's personal secret fancies and reading words that are nonsense. Then I realized the provided drawings are actually amateur oddities. And NOTHING is retainable anyway. I read every page, copied every example, and did every exercise, and I feel I've learned nothing, have not improved in my anatomical artistic abilities whatsoever, and accomplished nothing but wasting time.",1.0,0,2020

So Good!,"I've started this review several times but ended up deleting the words simply because they did not seem adequate.  I reached out to my reader's group and asked for a bit of help and one kind soul (Kay) gifted me with these words and I use them with her permission:  ""the phenomenal writing of raven Kennedy has once again stunned me speechless. Her way of storytelling leaves her readers feeling bereft when the last page is read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to lose themselves in a world so vivid and complex that their minds will forever be altered.

First in a new series.,"The author has an unusual writing style; if you have liked her other books you will like this.  She is building the story arc in this so things get complicated as the characters appear and the mystery develops.  It's a ""to be continued"" storyline, not precisely a cliffhanger but a lot of things are unresolved.  Still I liked the female lead , her cat, and the rest of the cast of characters and I enjoyed the book very much. I'm let down that it will be a year or more until the next one.

"A very good book, on a very unexplored period","Ugh! This book is such a mixed blessing. It offers a ton of detailed info into post war Japan. How life was when the war ended. How it was through the American Occupation. And how the Nation moved from despair to an actual Democratic Economic Powerhouse.<br /><br />Pro's; It gives a lot of detail into slices of life of the period. Things like just how daunting and horrific the repatriation of Japanese citizens from the points of their fallen empire was. How many never made it home from the USSR or China. Some good data and stories.<br /><br />Con's; Just one, but it's a bad one that clouds the entirety of the rest of the book. The Author is an Anti-American Academic who finds modern fault in US Actions or decisions taken in the time period, without respect to the context. His opening foreward reads like a History Undergrads best attempt to emulate the abomination of Howard Zinn.  The authors underlying ""War Bad"" ""White People Bad"" ""Americans = Colonialists"" etc quickly gets on your nerves.

Be prepared if you're going to read this book,"I thought my mother and I had a basically good relationship, although there were many things about my life that I did not tell her, partly because I knew she would not understand and partly because I did not want to hear her criticism. However, reading the variety of relationships between these women and men and their mothers stirred up memories of corporal punishment when I was young, arguments when I was a teenager, and grudges held by my mother - totally unknown to me - until she finally revealed some of them, thirty years after the fact. The truth is, no matter how loving your relationship is with a parent (or pretty much anyone else, for that matter), there are going to be points of disagreement. And, as witnessed by many of these authors, you can't always make things better because both parties have to be willing to change, willing to listen to the other person, willing to find a way to mend the brokenness between them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book but I will warn you - be aware that it will probably affect you in ways that surprise you greatly. Memories long forgotten may come flooding back, and not just memories of your relationship with your mother; you will be reminded of the entire family dynamic. Under the influence of these stories, I very nearly made the mistake of contacting a family member who is toxic. Fortunately I know myself well enough not to send messages in the wee hours of the morning, when I am at my weakest. Thank goodness I waited until the next day. My relief that I had not sent that message was overwhelming.<br /><br />So if you plan to read this, gird yourself for an emotional rollercoaster ride. And don't send any emails or texts at 3 a.m. Just trust me on that.",4.0,1,2020
"Wonderful, fast read","I was a bit leery of this book. I’m not one for vampire novels or stories of drug addition. But I gave it a chance and couldn’t be happier. It’s not a vampire book at all; it’s a murder mystery involving wealthy families in New York City in the early 1900s.

A strong woman growing into her own,"I couldn't put this book down and HAD to stay up very late to finish it.<br /><br />This book starts out with her mother dying and finding out she has rich relatives that will take her in as their own.  Except they don't really.  It's all a ruse.  For a while, they set her up to live their life - boring, meaningless, and you see what it's like to be rich with no morality, no goals, and unlimited money and privilege - a playland where they do whatever they want. Exciting in the beginning, but soon it feels empty. I almost stopped reading.  If this is as far as you read in the book, then I can see why you wouldn't like it. But this is written to contrast with the amazing middle and end of this book.  Just wait...<br /><br />You discover what it really feels like to be locked away in an insane asylum and have the life you know stolen from you, and later, to live through the devastating San Francisco earthquake and the weeks after it.  The details are so real that you feel like you are there experiencing them as her.<br /><br />Her bravery and determination are amazing.  You learn to love this strong, determined woman as she goes from innocence into full maturity within about a year.  She's truly an amazing person you'll enjoy cheering on as a friend.  And you catch a glimpse of what being rich yet wanting to help others is like.<br /><br />I especially appreciated that even though she goes through really tough times, this is still an upbeat enjoyable book, not a downer, but an adventure that you won't want to put down.",5.0,1,2020

"Easy read,  but disagree with lady C on some points","It's a very easy read, difficult to put down.  Nevertheless,  I feel the author (who I totally admire as a person) gives MM too much credit . She just got lucky that she met Harry,  because 99%of other wealthy families wouldn't put up with her shenanigans, especially that she really doesn't bring anything to the table.  Royal family is just too worried about their reputation to have a public scandal and Harry is too weak . I am sure if he had to choose between MM or being completely cut off and all his titles taken away. .  He would fall inline real fast.<br />Also,  I thought that lady C got a little carried away with her belief that MM can actually become US President.  First of all,  it's a lot more work than being royal,  second of all if you run you are subjected to such scrutiny of your past and investigations of your finances,  etc, and ridicule and hatred of""the other half"" that i don't think MM is up to it.  Also,  even the worst polititians are good debaters and even better public speakers,  and in this I disagree with [my favorite] lady C. MM is not intelligent enough to be a good debater or think on her feet,  and for some reason she persistently comes across as an annoying  phony in all her so called""speeches"",  she just lacks a charisma to be a good public speaker. She is just not a natural. SHE AIN'T GOT IT!<br />Also now I will say something that not everyone Beleives in.  Obviously MM is a believer into ""self hypnosis "" or what others call ""the secret"", or others call ""manifesting"". She Beleives that her thoughts and Beleives can shape reality if you practice repeating them long enough.  I think that's why she cuts off "" naysayers"" so fast...I happened to Beleive in it too.  I am sure now she is even more encouraged because she thinks she ""manifested"" Harry and her current life.  But here is a spoiler alert.  If you believe in that YOU GOT TO BELEIVE in carma,  too. You can't just Beleive in what is convenient  for you and not in other half . By being so nasty to people, including staff,  and so entitled and just being a bad person all around,  she created herself  really bad carma, and also a lot of  ""naysayers"" thoughts that coming across the world conciously or unconciously from many many people who witnessed her atrocious behaviour.  She can't do anything about it.  So if she keeps practicing self hypnosis chanting "" I am the most famous in the world ""or whatever she does now,  it might not work as well any more. ...<br />Also,  her claim to fame for just fame sake is honestly a little pathetic.  She doesn't have any special talents,  and A listers of different kinds she wants to associate herself with have talents (acting,  public speaking,  singing , etc). She just doesn't have anything to offer except being a ruthless  opportunist,  and it's not appealing in any country ( no matter what lovely and intelligent and classy lady C thinks of US) So I will be surprised if she achieves more than limited success.

Wonderful beach read,"I really wish Amazon allowed 1/2 stars for their reviews but since they don’t, you’ll just have to pretend to see the half star. Apart from being the closest thing I’ve read recently to a believable contemporary romance, this is just a good story of two mature adults with “baggage” that they both must work through in order to find refuge in each other.  Their baggage is essentially the same, broken hearts, even if the context is a bit different.  For January, the female protagonist, her broken heart is coupled with jarring, recent, doubly heartbreaking disillusionment and for Gus, his broken heart is confirmation of the disillusionment he’s known most his life.<br /><br />I won’t go into plot details, but there are a few things I’d like to point out.  One, the story’s small cast of secondary characters is fleshed out enough to make them expansive additions to the story rather than just filler.  Two, the “other woman” in the story delivers an interesting surprise element in the story line.  Three, the author writes a good enough story making it easy for the reader to hang in there as the relationship “percolates” between January and Gus.  It would have been so easy to make a quick trip to the bedroom early on as the attraction was certainly there but the author waited, knowing that the ultimate union would have much more impact.  I thank her for that.<br /><br />So, why the half star deduction?  The romance novel tropes began to fly fast and furious in the last 50 pages or so and I found them distracting.  However, that is a fairly minor complaint from a reader who normally can’t finish a contemporary romance without gagging.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a wonderful Beach Read.",4.0,1,2020

Create your own sequel instead.,"I really enjoyed Firefly Lane, and I looked forward to the sequel to see what happened in the aftermath of Kate's death. If this is your motivation in reading this book, too, I would advise you not to. This book is not just depressing, it's frustrating. Apparently Kate was the only strong character in the first novel, because everyone (with the exception of her mother) falls apart in this one. And not just falls apart- self destructs. They are selfish and isolated and depressing. Kate would have been disappointed in all of them. The only remotely worthwhile part of reading this book was finally learning Dorothy/Cloud's backstory, but to do that it ruined the image of Tully's loving grandmother. Overall I would say slip this book. If you truly loved the characters from Firefly Lane, I have no doubt you could create a better sequel for them that isn't so miserable depressing and so far from the characters presented in the first book. One last thing: if Marah had just read Kate's journal when Kate died instead of waiting 5 years it would have made a world of difference. Maybe start your version there?",1.0,0,2020
Save your money,"While the story was ok, the writing was not. There’s a TON of dialogue in this book, but the ONLY word the author could come up with when writing the conversations was SAID. I read 1-5 books per week, am over age 50, but I have NEVER read such awful writing. She could have used Google-“words to use in place of SAID”-550 examples. On page 254, she finally used “pronounced” & “trilled” but then went back to the overuse of SAID.<br />The editor failed this author.<br />The other annoying thing the author did at the beginning of the book was name-drop high dollar brands. Over & over. There are better ways to describe the wealth of people.<br />These things are perhaps more noticeable on the audible addition.

Loved this grumpy marshmallow of a hero and his sassy heroine!,"Absolutely loved, loved, loved getting to read about a second Bailey Brother falling in love. I'm so happy there are three left for us to get to enjoy! I'm also glad that Claire Kingsley likes to write series because she always crafts characters that we can't get enough of!<br /><br />Evan Bailey is the grumpiest, burliest, surliest sweetheart around. He's all bluster and gruffness, and Fiona is the bright ray of sunshine that he never thought he wanted. From their very first interaction, Evan is a little bit befuddled because Fiona is so magnetic, so charming and upbeat despite some negativity following her, and he is so used to being the surlypants that he is that he just doesn't know what to make of her. Fiona is an amazingly resourceful and resilient woman, and she crawls her way into Evan's guarded heart and takes up residence, practically rescuing him from the solitary confinement that he created for himself.<br /><br />Part of what I love about Claire's book sis that her characters are so real! Every woman that has worn tank tops to sleep, tried to sing in the car when they don't know all the lyrics, and talked to their plants can 100% relate to Fiona.<br /><br />Thank you for writing Evan and Fiona's story. Can't wait for the rest of those Bailey boys!<br /><br />ETA: After reading this back when it first came out, I could not wait to listen to the audio, especially when I found out that it was narrated by Jason Clarke and Ava Erickson. Jason Clarke is a favorite of mine, and his narration as grumpy, growly teddybear Evan was spot-on and absolutely perfect casting. He really brought Evan to life in a way that was so true to the character, and he made the experience so enjoyable. Ava Erickson was a great Fiona. She had all of the sweetness and sunshine that you expected from Fiona's character, as well as the determination that you knew she had to keep moving forward and keep herself on a good path despite all of the craziness around her.

"A structured, practical follow-up to expand on the ""neural"" basis of meditation techniques","I re-read ""Buddha's Brain"" - BB - in anticipation of this book (that may help derive greater utility with this book, though not a pre-condition) .  In BB, Hanson discussed the various aspects of the nervous system and provide a scientific frame to understand meditation.  (Another favorite book thats worth reading alongside is ""Why Buddhism is True?"").  BB did provide some practical lessons on how to activate the portions of the nervous system  critical to maintaiing a degree of calmness and be less reactive - but fell short of providing a cohesive, structured program or pathway  (similar to the methods Jon Kabat-Zinn employs).  This new book addresses that ""gap"" well.  If you are familiar with his previous works, this book reads like an attempt to provide a practical structure to the concepts described in BB while providing a much deeper context for ""Just One Thing"".<br /><br />In this book, he expands that notion in a more structured manner.  His definition of neurodharma is ""..truth of the mind grounded in the truth of the body, particularly in the nervous system.."" sounds more complicated than necessary - he is continuing to make a simple premise  mind-body are heavily intertwined.  Such flowery language sometimes distracts the flow - there are many mixed metaphors that reads silly (..""The routes they have charted travel from the dusty plains into the foothills and mountains and then the highest peaks of enlightment""; ""neural hardware, mental software"")<br /><br />The book (in 4 parts) is  a collection of seven practices positioned as ""essence of awakening"".  At the time of this review, the table of contents is not accessible - so here is a quick snapshot.<br />Part I (Embodied Practice) - two chapters that recaps aspects of neuroplasticity<br />Part II (Unshakeable Core) - three chapters (on steadiness, lovingness, fullness)<br />Part III (Living into Everything) - four chapters (on wholeness, nowness, allness, and timelessness)<br />Part IV (Always Already Home)  - a single concluding chapter emphasizing effort itself as success.<br /><br />Blending science and religion/philosophy in a secular-lite way is not an easy task and bound to be sometimes ackward.  Hanson approaches that ackwardness with humility - he qualifies his interpretations as ""limited perspectives of a middle aged, middle class, white American man"" and acknoweldges clearly that each of his seven practices have been studied in depth in various traditions.<br /><br />Each chapter is devoted to one practice - describes the core mental and neural foundations, reflections,  guided meditation/ideas on how to integrate the concept in daily life, and a suggested list of  additional readings. That structure lends itself well to a reader who may want to skip around to any particular theme or quickly access additional citations.  Since the impact of any of the techniques mentioned can obviously vary and can be realized (if at all) over time, it is silly to even comment on the meditation exercises itself.

Understanding the Russian,"I have this book 5 stars because it is undeniably the best book ever written by Red Phoenix! I keep thinking with each new release, there is no way she can top this book. But, we each new book she proves me wrong. If you like reading BDSM mixed with pulling of your heart strings, this book is for you! If you have read any of the Brie Series then you will be familiar with Rytsar. Understanding what drives this passionate man is profound. This is a journey like no other! Congratulations Red Phoenix!

Great book controlling anger for kids!,This book is for helping young children manage their anger. Nick is at the zoo with his mother and is mad because he cannot have that real live baby koala to take home! The zoo animals are very helpful giving him hints on what to do with his angry feelings. Things like breathing deeply and counting to 10 monkey helps him to do. Kangaroo encourages him to exercise in a variety of ways! I like the fanciful feel with the animals helping Nick to manage his angry feelings.<br /><br />The illustrations are colorful and captivate the reader’s interest. They fit the story nicely as Nick goes through the zoo meeting different animals to help him control his anger. Enjoy this book with your little ones!,5.0,1,2020

Author Must Have a Lot of Friends who Post Reviews,Thoroughly bad book. Read it because of the good reviews. Obviously they were paid for. Not well edited. Paragraphs repeated over several pages.

Won't Be Bothering With Book 2,"Descriptions like ""lush writing"" and ""compelling story"" lead me to purchase and read this book. Unfortunately, neither is true in my opinion. I read a review where someone complained about the ""flashbacks"" but, really, that's most of the story.<br /><br />The story has pretty big holes in it, I found. The bad guy is called a warlock - but only at the end - when it just sort of spills out how ""witches made by warlocks are always cursed"". What's this? We've been given no other information about other witches, if they're born or made, and that's part of the problem here. Nothing is really explained beyond a sort of ""here's this bad guy who's really a satanist and he turns this poor stupid girl into an immortal he feels he owns and so he pursues her down through the ages"". Which, honestly, is a bit stupid. Hundreds of years and he he hasn't managed to catch her or given up? A witch with intuition and everything but yet time after time she allows him to be right next to her for days, weeks, months, without seeing it?<br /><br />Maybe there are rules we aren't given? Maybe she has to go willingly? He does spend an awful long (agonizing) time repeating to her that she really wants it, that it gives her the best feeling, blah blah blah. Bit like the abuser telling his victim it wasn't rape because she secretly wanted it. Pretty gross.<br /><br />And oh the end! Lame, lame, lame.<br /><br />And Tegan? The ""daughter she never had"". It just all seems so desperate. Instead of liking or admiring the main character I'm left feeling she's stupid and should never have survived.<br /><br />So, all in all, I don't recommend reading this book and I certainly won't be picking up the second one. The writing is rather plain. The ""present time"" of 2007 is really just journal entries so rather plain and practical information. The ""flash backs"" attempt a different voice which mainly I just found irritating after a while. Each flashback should have just been called ""Bess gets dumber"".<br /><br />Oh, and he's Jack the Ripper, too. I sprained my eyeballs rolling them at that point.",2.0,0,2020
Shoddy Research Killed My Enthusiasm.,"Many authors write about things they have no experience of.  Most do a modicum of research.  Some don't.<br /><br />I can excuse the author has never been inside Langley.  His description of Agency employees as menswear fashion plates, however...  And Franklin, a former Marine, is a West Point (US Military Academy) graduate?  Technically possible... The honor graduate can choose another service, BUT! they rarely do.  US Marine officers that are academy graduates are US Naval Academy (Annapolis) graduates.<br /><br />And how does hot and humid Washington DC make England look ""tropical""?  Wouldn't DC be tropical compared to the chilly and rainy United Kingdom? I've been to both (and the tropics - Central America, Hawaii and equatorial Africa)  and while I have seen warm, sunny days in the UK I'd never mistake England for the tropics.<br /><br />And I haven't gotten to Iraq yet (been there too).<br /><br />If you're going to set a story in this world - as opposed to a fantasy world - the obvious details need to be researched.  Another reviewer mentions 'Wikipedia-level knowledge' but so far even that bar is too high.<br /><br />I paid .99¢ for this.  I'll struggle this implausible improbability at that price.  At $12.68 I'd want a refund.",2.0,0,2020
Cuts Through All The Tabloid Myths And Noise,"At last, royal watchers have access to a well-written biography by two royal journalists who actually know what has transpired behind palace gates. Scobie and Durand didn't use the opinions of dinner party gossips as ""sources"", they interviewed the following; royal aides, friends and work associates, witnesses to certain events, and people on the other side of the royal divide. The result is a balanced retelling of Meghan and Harry's first meeting, relationship, and the toll that the media's unending attacks took on them. If you are a Meghan ""hater"" who has already made your mind up about her, you might as well move on. But, if you are a reader who is interested in a balanced perspective that wasn't sourced from tabloid ""sources"", I encourage you to give this a read!",5.0,1,2020
Not really history & it doesn't really cover WWII,"This is basically a series of human interest stories about the victims of the war in Europe.  There is nothing about the causes of the war and almost nothing about the leaders or the generals or the strategy and tactics of the battles. There is very little about the war in the Pacific. In a sense, this is an extremely modern book because it focuses almost exclusively on the victims.  (Also, the focus is on the victims of the Nazis; very little about the victims of the Russians.) There are a lot of human interest stories about the horrors of war and the senseless deaths of non-combatants in Europe. If that is what you are looking for then this is the book for you.<br /><br />I object to the way this book is titled and marketed as a WWII history. I wanted a conventional one volume history of WWII. I already knew that the Nazis were bad and that innocent people died during this war.  I am going to return this book.",1.0,0,2020
Urban-fantasy Chick Lit in Space,"Hoped based on reviews for something well-written with plausible characters and a compelling plot. What I got was a cute opening premise--rich woman, brought low, splurges on equipment she can't afford for her indenture--which slowly descends into gibberish.<br />Starting with Walter's incoherent character and actions, continuing to Sil becoming an Insta promo model who somehow signals investment secrets based on her observations, implausible social interactions, weird rules and limitations on the AI which appear conveniently when needed... the book degenerates into word salad. Speaking of which, there are many misused words.<br />I stopped reading when some sort of new cartoonish cyborg villain was introduced with no foundation or foreshadowing a third of the way through.<br />I must admit, I was already put off by the  cardboard &#34;nice guy&#34; character and his ham-handed allusion to Jesus. I was afraid all this nonsense story was leading up to a sermon.<br />The supposedly thorough research is nowhere evident.This is less like sci-fi and more like urban fantasy chick lit in space.",3.0,0,2020
Don't Waste Your Money. Can't Believe I'm Saying That About 1 of My Fave Authors.,"I love Carl Hiaasen and have for many, many years. Every single book he's ever written (minus the teen books) had me laughing nonstop throughout each book.  I was SO excited to read Squeeze Me. I did what I always do when I'm about to read a new book by a fave author. I take care of any errands I need to run and make dinner ahead of time for my family. Then  I lock myself in the bedroom, flop down on the bed and devour the book in one sitting from cover to cover and don't stop until I've finished the book a few hours later.  I did not laugh once during Squeeze Me. The Hiaasen humor I've loved for years and years wasn't there this time around.  I did not feel any kind of connection or especially like the main characters.  As I approached the end of the book, I didn't feel that little nagging feeling I get when I'm close to finishing a book that I love and don't want to end. In fact, I nearly gave up reading Squeeze Me a few times. Most of all, Hiaasen went overboard with the Trump bashing. I am NOT a Trump fan/supporter. I did not vote for him in 2016. I will not vote for him in 2020.  But I am SO very tired of everything being about him. TV shows...movies...podcasts...books.... He already dominates the news every single day and for me, that's more than enough time spent on him. I want TV shows, movies, books, etc to be entertaining and an escape from what is happening in this country. Make a joke here and there about him. That's fine. It really is.  Stop shoving him down our throats over and over again. Hiaasen's main goal in this book was to trash Trump. This book isn't about Kiki Pew or Angie. Its about Hiaasen's hatred of the president.  And that hatred ruined the book. Never ever imagined I'd read a Hiaasen book and not laugh hysterically throughout as I always do. Never ever imagined I'd tell someone to skip a Carl Hiaasen book as he has always been a favorite of mine. Never imagined I'd give Hiaasen review 1 out of 5 stars. This book is so flat, dull and boring. Don't waste your money.",1.0,0,2020
"Tired of all the Christian talking heads?  Please read this instead.  (Hey, I rhymed!)","N.T. Wright has done it again.  This little booklet packs more punch, theology, wisdom, and application into its 80 pages then most scholars can do in twice, or even three times the space.<br /><br />Wright isn't content to just provide pat answers, or to give us the answers we want to hear.  He keeps going back to the Bible, back to Jesus, and back to our responsibilities as image-bearers of God.  In an age of knee-jerk reactions, social shaming, and trying to out-shout your ""opponents"", such a stubborn view of the issues is not only refreshing and welcome, but necessary if we are to maintain our status as the people of God.<br /><br />Wright builds a solid foundation for his premise, starting from the Old Testament, and walking us all the way through the Gospels and Jesus.  And even though the book is short, this crucial part is given the time and care it deserves, though Wright does have a knack for saying what needs to be said in a succinct, and easy-to-understand manner.<br /><br />It is true that you could skip these first three chapters, and get right to the meat of our proper response in chapters 4 and 5.  And it would even make sense.  But you would be doing yourself a disservice, and robbing yourself of some crucial context, not just for COVID-19, but for any tragic situation that might befall you in the future.<br /><br />The pandemic is not a reason to push people to repent (though that may happen), it is not a sign of the end times (though we may be close - who knows?), and it is not God's judgment on mankind.  What it is, is a time for the church to lament, to grieve, and then to *not* ask ""Why is this happening?"", but to ask instead, ""What should we be doing?""<br /><br />As you can see below I rarely give 5-star reviews.  So I really mean it when I say this is a special booklet, one that every Christian owes it to themselves to read.  And given its short page count, you don't have an excuse not to.<br /><br />---------------<br />I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between the two sites.<br /><br />5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only 30 in a lifetime.<br />4 - Very good.<br />3 - Worth your time.<br />2 - Not very good.<br />1 - Atrocious.",5.0,1,2020

"I want to give this 4 stars, but can't","I've read a couple other books by this author and have noticed that he often has long meanderings away from the plot or at least that seem to lose focus on the plot.  This story is a good idea.  The world is strange, but overall workable.  The hero is more of a geek Gary Stu than he should be and stupid to boot.  But the story is fun.<br /><br />The problem was that there would be pages of just ""fluff"" that added nothing to the tale.  I'd find myself skimming pages of the monster girls antics, or of the main character's angst ridden mental soliloquys.  These dragged down a very good book.<br /><br />**warning the following might be considered a spoiler**<br />Another major problem I had with the entire story was that the hero Charles had been hired to create ""super-soldiers"" for the Duchess.  Once he accidentally created a cat-girl he basically abandons this and spends a huge part of the remaining tale working to create a second monster girl.  Not once does he stop to consider a monster-man might be exactly what the Duchess wants.  Instead he has multiple arguments with the Duchess (who comes out several days in a row to berate him and complain about how long its taking.)  It just never felt like the author asked what I considered to be one of the most obvious questions available.  (and one he could have tried without endangering himself.)<br /><br />**end spoiler**<br /><br />But while I have complaints, I still enjoyed the idea and did grow fond of Charles and Val.  There was a good idea here and the author made use of that, even if some plot decisions disappointed me.<br /><br />But the plot decisions also meant that I can't give this 4 stars.  Instead its a very high 3 stars.  Its good and fun, but there are enough plot problems that my recommendation comes with strings attached.  You may wind up feeling that the world is a bit unformed.",3.0,0,2020
Spare me from idiot savant characters.,"How is it that so many characters in so many books are just so bloody bad.  The main character in this book is a master at one of the five kinds of magic even before he shows up for his assessment for Bastion Academy, and uses that mastery to win robot prize fights to accumulate money so that his mother and siblings won't starve while he's in his first year at school.  It's all quite noble even though the prize fights he attends are illegal and getting caught would mean no school for him.<br /><br />Well, he could go to a local much less expensive academy, but he's a noble knight who must sacrifice all for his family.  Except for all the academy rules he breaks:<br /><br />He keeps participating in robot fights (must send money home to the family, since Mom is dying of a wasting disease)<br />He keeps looking into a relic his father left him.  (the same father that ran away from the family 6 years before and who the MC doesn't believe is going to return)<br />He gets involved in a rivalry with some rich man's son for....  (This one was stupid, he looked at a pretty girl and the other boy had instant hate for the MC.)<br /><br />It goes on, but the key to me was that I wanted to be Kuni from the movie UHF and scream at the MC  ""Stupid!  You're so STUPID!""  Seriously, I know he's a teenager, and they can do dumb things at times, but this character is supposedly brilliant enough to create one of the top robots in the region, but then breaks rules, lives on angst and fails to listen to teachers who can expel him if he's caught breaking rules.  When he absolutely cannot afford to be expelled if he's to achieve the goals he's set for himself.<br /><br />It's a dualism that I hate.  It feels like its a method to hide a Gary Stu (Mary Sue) situation where the MC is too powerful, too noble, too special.  Instead of perhaps giving him real challenges by weakening him, bad personality flaws are substituted, and for me at least, its an incredible turn off.  I'd rather have a frightfully weak MC who has to struggle, strive and overcome, than a powerful MC who is given to angsty soliloquies and indecision or bad decision making in an effort to build tension.  It never feels organic for me when the MC is an angst-ridden mess.<br /><br />I love academy tales, but this series is a one and done for me.  I felt that the MC's flaws were excessively obvious and created a cliché tale that is just not fun to read.  However, this is not a bad book, it just hits points that I hate reading and turned the story into one that is easy for me to dislike.",3.0,0,2020
"MOC, heroine grows a spine and hubby learns to grovel. A little.","I have read this several times, and it is obviously popular.<br /><br />Brief Synopsis:<br />Theresa fell in love with Alpha Romero Alessandro and gets married only to find out her husband can't stand her. The can't stand part extends to only when they are upright as they have sex like bunnies about four times a week. After every encounter he says one thing. Nope, not the three little words we all want, ""I love you."" The Jerk's special little words are, ""Give me a son, Theresa."" Once she does, he can escape for Italy, his real family, and his twue love, Francesca. OUCH.<br /><br />After 18 months of this and one more sexually earth-shaking but emotionally nordic-blasting experience with hubby, Theresa say no mas, grazie. She's had it. It was bad enough being raised by her father aka Mr. Freeze, but now she's found herself in a marriage with a man that can't stand her. The Jerk is shocked and throws some poor little rich girl carp at her, but she is done. She heads out of the house, watches too many movies, eats too much popcorn, but the worm has turned.<br /><br />The twist is SPOILER the h's father owns vineyards that used to belong to Jerk's father. Basically the h's father blackmails the H into marrying his daughter, giving him a GRANDSON and then, and only then, will he deed the stupid vineyard to the H's dying father. Jerk assumed Theresa knows all about the deal. This miscommunication goes on for over 18 months. END spoiler)]<br /><br />Once the penny drops, the penny being now that he knows his wife is an innocent victim, Jerk goes into mega-courting as only a guilt ridden stupid man can do. He introduces her to the friends he's been playing soccer (football) with for the past year and a half, he asks her to lunch, and is all and all so beta. She sees through it all and wants none of it. All she wants is to get a divorce and lick her wounds. Sadly, our alpha Romero's magic sperm has finally struck.<br /><br />Now that she's pregnant, Theresa is stuck. The rest of the story is poor Jerk trying to wiggle his way into the h's good graces.<br /><br />Anders does a decent redeeming a hateful hero, and she graciously allows the h to keep her spine and make the hero work for it. A rarity in Romanceland.<br /><br />I am  still not convinced about Jerk though as his turnaround from being an emotionally abusive creep to loving husband is not explained well enough for me.",3.0,0,2020
"🌞🌞Everyone Deserves A Little ""Sunshine"" In Their Life...🌞🌞","If you've read Lucy Score's Pretend You're Mine followed by Finally Mine, then Protecting What's Mine will bring a little ""sunshine"" (pun intended) into your life! Even though this newest book can be enjoyed as a standalone, let me suggest you start with the series in order. The small town of Benevolence is packed with handsome heros, kick-a$$ heroines and charming, funny townspeople. In addition, readers can always count on Ms. Score to craft well-written and edited stories with a creative mix of humor, a little angst, and lots of hot romance to keep her readers enthralled.<br /><br />Protecting What's Mine delivers all the above (and more) with Fire Chief Linc Reed, surgeon MacKenzie O'Neil, and let's not forget Linc's furry, funny, four legged friend...Sunshine! The Chief is hotter than the fires he fights and the good doctor is about to get sizzled by this sexy, hunky firefighter! These two might even singe the ""pages"" of your e-reader!<br /><br />As a devoted fan of the contemporary romance genre, Pretend You're Mine ranks as my absolute favorite book of all time (yes...I have a written list), but Protecting What's Mine is so close to number one they now share the same line. It is not often I read a book where I am laughing one moment, crying in the next, and dreading the ending because I don't want the story to end. Lucy Score's Protecting What's Mine is one of those special books. Thank you Ms. Score for an excellent story, wonderful characters, a riveting plot, and most of all...Sunshine to warm the heart and soul!",5.0,1,2020
Too true.,"I got into this book  for a fairly sad reason. A dear friend recently passed away. He had been suffering from heart and pulmonary issues as well as diabetes. Retired, well educated professional living alone. The attorney handling estate issues told me that my friend had been scammed. From the local bank account representing his emergency reserves he had sent $25k to a Western Union address, another $25k in gift cards. The autopsy showed he died from an overdose of his medications. (Note the police declined to follow-up other than checking the Western Union address and determining no information was available regarding who picked up the funds.)<br /><br />Why, I wondered would someone this intelligent fall for this type of scam? This question led me to Maria's book which she answers quite well. Seems no one, no matter how educated, intelligent or careful is immune to the well executed con. She delves into the structure of the con, the stages involved, why they work or don't and why those scammed often continue to believe the con was legitimate.<br /><br />Also includes some of the more interesting historical scams such as Ponzi, Madoff, etc. The book was well written enough that I have moved off to her examination of the world of professional poker. If cons are an area of interest for you, hard to beat this one.",4.0,1,2020

Unbelievable and unnecessarily vulgar,"Some many things in the book just scream unbelievable to me.  British peer (a 59 year old Baron, no less) who is also a ranking police inspector falls for a crass, vulgar subordinate, with no redeeming qualities.  Kate is written as a typical ""East Ender"" who can't quite shake her cockney accent, and seems to be overly interested in the size of her colleagues' genitals.  Our first glimpse of Kate is when she engages in a crude shouting match with a superior in front of other police officers.  In spite of this vulgar display, Lord Tony is smitten with her at first sight (read ""lust""), later engages her in a weirdly bizarre and disturbing wrestling match, where she notices and comments on his erection, and then vacillates between being overly familiar, letting her call him Tony (which would never happen at Scotland Yard), and then switching to being cold and formal.  From the title, I assume he ends up marrying her (really a stretch).  Even Kate seems puzzled by his sudden attention, debates with herself about whether or not she finds him attractive, but finally realizes he would be her ticket out of her sad little life.  Eliza Doolittle meets Henry Higgins.<br /><br />So much of the police procedure described in the book also does not ring true.  What police officer would interview a murder suspect over lunch and let the suspect pay?  Also, the ending where the murderer is revealed just reads like a quick wrap-up because the author just got tired of writing the story.  Also unbelievable is how quickly the murderer just fesses up even though there is no real evidence that would convict her.  All in all, I will stick to Dorothy Sayers and Elizabeth George.",1.0,0,2020
Silly Not Sharp,"A serial killer wields his lethal skills on different continents. A multilingual FBI agent with triple citizenship pursues him from the states to Europe.  But he is clever enough to turn the tables on her.<br /><br />This is a silly story that quickly becomes as annoying as it is unbelievable. First the agent doesn't have a clue about the killer's identity or how he selects his victims. Other than having a thing for certain ages and a brutal manner of death they know nothing. Very unlikely they would fly her over and put her in charge of the investigation. But then professionalism is not a hallmark here. The behaviour of the characters is appalling. Sharp's partner constantly calls her ""American Princess"" which quickly becomes irritating and offensive. He refuses to remove his legs forcing a female member of another agency to have to climb over him. Which she does, even worse. There is a bar in the basement and Sharp's former supervisor behaves . poorly compromising Sharp's ability to perform. But even worse is when they finally have someone who got away there is no follow-up. Maybe he died or moved to Canada. There is nothing about him after he is taken to the hospital. Then when they are going to interview suspects, one of whom is likely to be the killer,they split up. This is not a sharp mystery; it is a silly one.",2.0,0,2020

The Royals come across as patient, fair and long-suffering, much more so than I would have presumed.<br /><br />The material could really use a proper edit, but this will hopefully be addressed and corrections made in future updates. The writing doesn’t always flow well and is confusing, at times. However, the story is so entertaining, I wasn’t terribly bothered by this. The authors seem to think MM had achieved a greater level of fame than she actually did. They refer to her as the 'show's (Suits) main star' , which she was not and a 'highly successful actress' - again, no.<br /><br />Divided into five parts (see list below this paragraph), the book addresses all the players in the continuing drama of MM and Harry, from the history of their respective families, including some geneology, through present day. I didn’t find any new revelations in the section on Princess Diana and Prince Charles, but the story of the Middleton’s included some facts of which I wasn’t aware. MM's earlier years are covered, along with her time as an actress, as well as when/how she met her Prince...<br /><br />Sections in Book:<br /><br />1. The Divisive Duchess<br />2. The Making of Meghan<br />3. Royal Welcome for the Other Woman<br />4. A Star is Born<br />5. When Harry Met Meghan<br /><br />The book is a comprehensive overview of the subject indicated by it's title, but it doesn't go into great depth. I'd say it accomplishes the expected purpose...Enjoy!",4.0,1,2020
An enjoyable read about senior women friends,"I don’t usually read a book like this. Many that I read are historical fiction, where facts and fiction merge. I got this from an online site to link to Amazon and read free. I liked the synopsis and especially that the women were all seniors. Expecting the senior women to be cramped with arthritis and not taken seriously was my biased view but I was very wrong. How often have you read that after 50 women become invisible?  In this book they definitely are not invisible!  Five very different women  meet at a swim aerobics class and become friends over several months.  A trip to Paris for 6 days to celebrate a special occasion is planned.  That’s where it starts to become fun. It was a positive spin on older women and their relationships. Nice to read a feel good book about older women. I will now download another of Judy Leigh’s books to keep the positive energy going.",5.0,1,2020
Couldn't finish the story because of language,"I really wanted to like this book and it does have good reviews.  The only thing is; it is sprinkled throughout with 'f' words and that alone will ruin a book for me.  I am not a prude and know that this is just the way some people talk but I read a book to escape the world and go into another one.  Profanity does not add to a story.  There are plenty of other words to use and a good writer will know what they are.  I realize I open myself up to ridicule but for people like me who appreciate a good book without the use of profanity, I want them to know it is there and to make their own choice about what to read.  If it was cleaned up I would have read it to the end.",3.0,0,2020
Nope,"Ugh. This book was trash. 15% in I knew it was trash. Did I finish it? Yes. For some reason it intrigued me enough to finish, but it was an utter waste of 4 hours of my life.<br />I wanted a fun fast, taboo romance read and a lot of people have raved over this book. If you love it, I am super happy for you.<br />The biggest problem I had with this book was the writing was so extremely juvenile. The talk between characters was so awkward and weird. Literally no one would ever say what they said in real life. On top of that, you had to read the book Elec published which was WORD FOR WORD what already happened in the first half of the book, but in his POV. Now, this could’ve been a cool element to add since it was strictly in Greta’s POV the whole time, except the author added in all the same dialogue. So yes, you had to relive the awful dialogue for the second time. IN THE SAME BOOK.<br />Now on to the story. Within the first couple pages, Greta is all hot and bothered over Stepbrother Dearest (see what I did there?) and I absolutely hated that. This is supposed to be a forbidden romance so why is the main character head over heels for her step brother within 30 seconds of meeting him? On top of that, of course she has to be a virgin and extremely polite and nice and naive. Gag. She also let’s Elec treat her like absolute garbage. Now I am all for enemies to lovers tropes, but there is a difference when the male is a top notch jerk and the girl is still fawning over his every need. Hard pass.<br />On top of this, the characters had zero development. Elec was supposed to be some bad boy with a rough past (yawn) who was a sex god. But when it came to the sex scenes, they were so sub par. I was expecting some hot a** writing with all that build up and it was just so l a m e.<br />The ending was boring and predictable.<br />Overall, I am clearly disappointed. I never know what to expect when reading books by this author because they are VERY hit or miss for me. I have ranged her books from 1 star to 5 star. But I truly am sad about having to give this book such a low rating because I wanted it to be good so bad.<br />I am sad I wasted $4 on this ☹",2.0,0,2020

OMG this is the most amazing cookbook of all time!!!,"Update to add a note about the Kindle version: Amazon currently has a warning that “broken navigation” has been reported for this title. If this is true, it is not widespread. Every link I have clicked took me to the correct page, and this title has been very easy to navigate in my experience. Sections and recipes are easy to jump to with links, index has links that work. If there are issues I haven’t experienced them. I highly recommend the kindle version of this book. It’s easy to navigate, image quality is excellent, easy to annotate, highlight, and copy, and you always have the book just one click away. To my mind this is what a kindle cookbook should be, but since I haven’t clicked every single link I can’t say there isn’t one or few links that might be broken? Just don’t be fooled into thinking there is a major formatting problem because there isn’t.<br /><br />I never thought I’d binge read a cookbook, like a thriller novel turning page after page anxiously to see what is next...but that is exactly what happened. Like every page was a new OH WOW moment for me. I should have prefaced this to say I’ve spend the last couple of years trying to learn to cook Filipino foods, but even beyond that he has included so much more...sauces...stocks everything. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this book. Everything about this from his story to the recipe comes across as honest and sincere. A guy who has a remarkable story and a genuine love of food and wants to share those truths with you in a way you can actually use. As a for instance he starts with his personal technique for cooking the perfect Jasmine rice without a rice cooker. A lot of people might say “I already know how to cook rice” but it is the foundation on which every recipe is built, so he makes sure you know how to do it right. It’s just one example of how he really explains to the home cooks of the world exactly what they need to do for success. He gives brand names he recommends for the ingredients some readers might not be familiar with which is a true rarity in cookbooks, and a real life saver...you might be able to relate if you’ve ever been overwhelmed by all the choices in an Asian grocery store. The photography is so warm and soothing, taken with a real shallow depth of focus and well lit, they are every bit as beautiful as you might expect from a restauranteur who holds the distinction of possibly having created the most instagrammed foods of all time. It feels like a warm soothing dream of comfort foods, which is in a way what this book is all about. And something else that’s remarkable, is there is no ego here. In a day and age when so many celebrity chefs are raging balls of ego, it is so refreshing to find a chef that is just sincerely sharing his love of food and sharing the love for the people who inspired his food love. If you have any interest at all in cooking Filipino food I can categorically tell you this is the best cookbook to get, I have purchased and tried just about every one Amazon sells, and although I have not cooked the recipes from this book yet I can tell from reading them this one is really special. And as a side note, do you know how many Filipino cook books don’t even include a recipe for pan de sal? This may be the only one I’ve found that actually includes it. If there is any justice this cookbook will be an award winning best seller. I will update this review as I cook the recipes, but I have never been so enthusiastic about getting started trying all the recipes in a new cookbook. And Alvin if you happen to read this I want to thank you personally for this. The most special person in my life is Filipina and the food love you shared from your family will be loved and cherished by ours. Much love to you.<br /><br />Day 1: I made Pan de sal (pictured) and it was the best I’ve made so far. Alvin May disagree that it’s even pan de sal because I chose not to use bread crumbs. But whatever you call it, it was delicious. I also tried making the Jasmine rice by his method and failed miserably. I was waiting for the steam to die down and it too much longer than his guideline and the end result was a gelatinous mess instead of rice. I will have to go back and revisit it to see what went wrong but learn from my mistake: unless you know the method is going to work for you scale it down. I just wasted 4 cups of rice during a pandemic. Not cool. I plan to cut it down to 1/4 next time I try his method. Despite my failure with the rice, I’m still totally geeked out about this book. Tomorrow I will try the hot-si-log for breakfast<br /><br />Day 2: Hot si-log. This was freaking amazing. My wife says the garlic fried rice is better than the one From her favorite restaurant. it’s legit because that’s pro level. A tip for anyone who wants to score the hotdog, put it between the handles of two wooden spoons so you cut to a uniform depth. Also heads up, you might get confused on the garlic fried rice recipe because he links you to his recipe that calls for 4 cups uncooked rice. This recipe calls for 4 cups, but at least in my interpretation it’s 4 cups of cooked rice (about 1/3 of the recipe he linked to). All I can say for sure is using 4 cups cooked rice is the way I’m doing it because it was pure amazing. I’m making more pan de sal today because we already have requests from the family for some. I’ll update after I make a new dish, probably in a day or two. Oh, one more thing...be sure to get the chives for your fried rice. Flavor magic. Trust me, you don’t want to skip them. Update: we love this and keep making it. Always delicious. But you may want to only add chives to the portion of rice you are serving. Try to leave them out of anything you know will be leftovers that will be reheated. Their flavor really intensifies in the fridge and it can be overpowering by the time you heat up the leftovers. It’s best to add them fresh if you can.<br /><br />Day 3: The signature dish from Eggslut. Coddled eggs over buttery mashed potatoes garnished with chives and pink Himalayan sea salt. We served this with toasted slices of pan de sal because that’s the only bread we had. It was out of this world delicious but very filling. This would be the cure for what ails you if you are down and need some comfort food. Warm, rich and delicious. It’s also fun to spear the egg with the bread. It comes out bright yellow from the yolk but also bring some rich potatoey goodness with it. I recommend using an artisan bread with good crunch. Fresh pan de sal is still a bit chewy after toasting. A potato ricer is handy if you make this dish. Fantastic flavor pairing though. Tonight we are making mechado. Beef broth is going through the filter right now. Will update tomorrow.<br /><br />Day 4: Mechado. This was really good, the homemade stock he uses really does transform this from very simple to complex flavor. I definitely wouldn’t skip the homemade stock. I think next time I make this I will add carrots and maybe olives like kaldeteta. I’ve had Mechado at restaurants that was very much like kalderata, possibly even down to the liver paste. This is a much cleaner stew, mostly meat and potato with sweetness from onion and brightness from the lemon. As flavorful as it is, I do miss the extra vegetables and mix ins that I’m used to. This cookbook continues to amaze. I’m so impressed by the beef stock base that I’m going to make the veggie and chicken stocks next.<br /><br />Day 5: Nilago. It’s just a pure simple delicious stew. Alvin said it best, it’s a hug in a bowl. Fish sauce at the table is a must do everyone can season as they like. I added some spicy red pepper as a garnish to mine because I love spicy food. It was amazing! A tip I learned from foodnatics is to add two star anise and a little butter to Nilaga. Alvin’s way is better. For me the star anise took away from the dish but if you are adventurous you might want to give it a try. In my opinion the heart of this dish is in being simple and clean. But everyone’s taste is different. Not a dig on foodnatics, they have the best adobo recipe of all time.<br /><br />Day6: Patis fried chicken with white adobo sauce. The chicken was quite tasty. I recommend only making half the amount of rice flour especially if you grind it by hand like I did. Ended up throwing out 3/4 of it. This is a major win if you are gluten free. I prefer the texture of flour based breading though. The chicken tasted really flavorful, but you don’t detect the Patis or lemon. It’s a really interesting take on fried chicken. I’d like to try the real thing if Alvin serves it in his restaurant.",5.0,1,2020
it grew on me,"Vernacular is hard. You have to get past the language, or learn to flow with it, even when you don't understand some slang term or it's a rhythm that you don't groove with. I had to fight through the vernacular in the beginning with this book, just as I did with Huck Finn--it can seem corny and sort of ""put on"". I also resisted learning about this period of history and cast of characters, although I was interested in the main conceit, which is that John Brown mistakes young slave Henry Shackleford for a girl, puts him in a dress, saddles him with the name ""Onion"", and drags him all over tarnation as a sort of mascot toa raggedy bunch of freedom fighters, encountering all manner of terrible people.  Once I got going, the book was riveting. and I learned SO MUCH about the abolitionist movement, the raid on Harper's Ferry, and what life was like during and after the Civil war in general. If you're ok to push past slow beginnings, I think you'll find this book worth your time. It really stuck with me.",5.0,1,2020
I loved it until the final act,"Wow.  This is one that I'm going to have to put in a TL:DR at the start and then a huge spoiler warning.<br /><br />To start with if I want to condense the review, the title basically says it all:  This is every bit as good as the other 4 in this series and among the best that Daniel has written.  However, the ending was in my opinion a mess.<br /><br />So I give it 4 stars, but with a couple of quibbles (and now I want to scream WARNING SPOILERS as I go over why I had issues with the ending.)<br /><br />Ok, First, this story ends in the middle of a battle, with the main result pretty much decided, but the total survivors still undetermined.  That is just not all that acceptable to me.  I dislike this kind of cliffhanger on general principles because it requires leaving major plot points and threads hanging without resolution or closure until the next book comes out (which might never happen, although I doubt Daniel is as bad as George R.R. Martin has proved to be.)<br /><br />Second (and again SPOILERS!) the final fight was only close because in a world where the gods were banned by the Fae Queens, you suddenly have a Valkyrie and 20 of her Einherjar standing around in the court of a supposedly unremarkable fae Lord, and willing to become lifebonded to some Fae Knight just to allow them to fight against the MC and his harem.  This really broke my immersion.  It was way to Deus ex Machina.  Why would Odin allow some of his minions enter this world?  Why would the Queens who fought the Tuatha to ban gods from their world deign to allow this band to openly enter their lands?  Why would the Fae Lord trust them?  Why would they lifebond anyone considering how powerful lifebonds are in this world?  It seemed to violate just about the entire canon Daniel had set up.  Now, this is something he's done before (in fact its his biggest flaw in my opinion, he has a habit of needing to turn the power of the villains to infinity and beyond.)  But I really dislike this twist.  he had a solid tale without the power spike in the enemies.<br /><br />And worse the cliffhanger includes the fact that the holder of these life bonds is killed and then the MC turns to attack the remaining living Einherjar.  If lifebonds work as described in book 1, where the death of the holder of the bond means the swift death of all bonded, those Einherjar should already be feeling the effects.  Why not finish the fight?  There was so much riding on that match, that Daniel could have closed the plot point without reducing interest in book 6.<br /><br />Just not what I like.  However, I did like the book overall, and while I want to beat him into a pulp for the ending, I'm going to forgive it enough to give an extremely low 4 star rating.  This is a good book, but honestly, I'd wait until book 6 is available so you aren't stuck waiting for the conclusion to this book's Act 3.",4.0,1,2020

An interesting first book in the series,"Overall I enjoyed this book.  The author has a deft hand with characters and the action is well done.  However, the author over-uses a plot device that can greatly help a book from becoming tedious but at the risk of halting the story.  The plot device is:<br /><br />“Stuff Happened”<br /><br />The story will lead to a conclusion or tipping point, basically like a cliffhanger.  Then the reader turns the page into a new chapter where it’s hours, days, or weeks later and: “Stuff Happened”.  The reader is left with a “Wait, what…?” and the author uses a few paragraphs to say “Oh, yeah, this and that happened and now we’re here”…<br /><br />As a reader I find this frustrating.  After the first couple, I say to myself: “Damn it, again??!”  I get that it is a valuable tool to help keep the story flowing, and this book is fast paced.  Too much brevity, however can suck the life out of the story turning it into a travelogue.  So, one star off.  Still, I did enjoy the tale and will buy the next book when it arrives.",4.0,1,2020
This is NOT a dull book,"This review is a deliberate rebuke to the claims that this is a 'dull' book.  It is not.  It is a wonderful record of a lost era written by a woman who was blessed with an unusual seat at the table.  Read about how her brother survived as a POW at Colditz Castle prison.  Read how she fell in love with a penniless, rogue, MARRIED man who got an annulment and was gifted with a YOU GO GIRL! letter from the current queen upon their marriage. Read about how she stalked a stag with a roar, shot it and skinned it in the field. With a pen knife.  Margaret doesn't have an axe to grind, she has a story of a well lived - and not always easy -  life to tell and she tells it with a genteel grace that deserves to be appreciated.  I did not give it 5 stars because I think she has been a bit TOO reticent - by the time she wrote it everyone knew that the Queen Mother was not the sweet, loving, slightly tipsy grandma her public personna would have us believe so there's a bit of a cover up there.

One of the guys is stuck in frat boy mode. One is stuck in jealous jerk mode, and one is emotionally damaged that gave up the chance of an exclusive relationship without a second thought ....just pisses me off. She blames them for having more opportunity instead of talent ....she's just a jerk of a character and it made me done with the series. That and the few steamy scenes seemed super awkward.

An over-generous two,"While the characters are mildly appealing with good potential for development, I was disappointed that the element of  intrigue in the plot received so MUCH LESS attention than the graphic sexual attraction and unrealistic culmination of said. Adding insult to injury, this is NOT a book; it's merely an INSTALLMENT with an ill-timed cliffhanger. Charles Dickens might have used this method to pre-publish his lengthy novels in the tabloids of his day, but Nana Malone is no Charles Dickens.<br /><br />In an actual book series, it is okay (but not optimal) to have a cliffhanger leading to the next book in the series, but failing to reach a conclusion to ANY of the plot lines to the story you're actually in (purely for the sake of generating more book sales) is cheap, manipulative and just plain SORRY writing!

"the Constitution requires that the president have dictatorial powers, like Putin","You may know John Yoo as the person who argued that the US has a right to torture. Opponents have said that this violates the rights of the detainees, but what about the rights of the torturers, huh, huh? They didn't think of that.<br /><br />This book argues that Presidential power ""actually advances individual freedom by curbing the threats of legislative...tyranny"".  Indeed the President is elected by popular vote (popular vote of members of the electoral college, duh), whereas senators and congresspeople don't even have an electoral college---sad! Hence presidential tyranny is much more constitutional than legislative tyranny. Why not get the tyranny from a person who is required to have been born in the USA (or Panama), rather than from legislators who have all sorts of national origins? Makes a lot of sense.

You can say that they broke up over something that could have been solved with communication, but honestly, they were not mature enough to think things through and have the perspective that they would have needed to make it work. But they are fully ready to grab this second chance by the horns now that it has unexpectedly presented itself.<br /><br />I read the book and listened to the audio. I like to read the book first to experience just the story, and then if I like the book, I listen to the audio to get the more emotional experience that narration brings.

The supposedly ""strong"" heroine doesn't resemble a single real woman I'd describe as self-sufficient or in any way strong, although she does have a tendency to weird, alcohol-driven outbursts. Her constant drinking is such a sad cliche. She's not even an appealing or likeable caricature.  Not much action, lots of talking.  The humor is not clever, it's sort of overwrought and juvenile.  The person who, I suppose, is the love interest, is primarily described by his ""rippling"" (and in other ways moving) muscles and that he's an ""alpha"".  Again, overwrought and juvenile.

The Libertarian Agenda is a Big Fat Fail!,"For 12 years I met w/7-10 Libertarians twice a month or more.  I enjoyed my banter with them until I became bored w/the same-old same-old rhetoric.

This book was fun to read because the author wove in the tale of the bears w/the fate of the Libertarians.  He has a knack for portraying personalities and frenetic scenes w/few appropriate words.  It is a quick fun relaxing read and I recommend it.  FYI, I have recommended it to the Libertarians I lunched with.  I am sure their stubborn personalities will not allow them to read about a Libertarian fail.  One more thing ... when I started lunching w/the group, I was actually concerned that their ideas could pick up speed and at some point they might be a force, especially when the Goldwater Institute has a rather substantial membership.  This book completely puts that frightful nightmare at rest.  Don't be fooled when ""true"" libertarians say the characters in the book are anarchists, not Libertarians.  Indeed this how the Libertarian agenda unfolds ... it is where the philosophy leads.  Enjoy!",5.0,1,2020
"Exciting, Fascinating, Humorous, Shocking,Easy read","I actually thought this book would be dry and hard to understand. It’s not. It’s incredibly well written and a good way to get an education about all sorts of pathogens. This story will definitely stand the test of time. Genocidal lunatics have gotten away with too much for too long. Those of us who are awake to the horrors of dirty vaccines are definitely on the right side of history. If you’re in doubt then read the book. Even if you’re not in doubt, read the book. It’s fantastic!",5.0,1,2020
Fantastic read that you can't put down,"I received an advanced reader's copy of this book through an Instagram giveaway and have been dying to review this book! I read it in a sitting, only getting up as absolutely necessary. I loved following Oona's life SO very much. While lived out of order, it was so well-written and incredibly detailed, bringing me to years I wasn't even alive in to experience and so vividly that I had to check my license.

I don't think this book would be enjoyable without the context of the previous volumes, and I envy anyone the pleasure of reading them for the first time.<br />Now here I sit, wondering how I could enjoy this so much after so many books and still be really anticipating what comes next because Wulfe, Sherwood, and Bran still hold so many secrets.

Bad Choice(s),"I was swayed to choose this book by all the praise for the smart women characters. For me, their brilliance didn't shine through the pall of too many bad choices and an overabundance of happenstance. Little Mercy seemed more observant than the supposed cryptogenius and fast-track cop.<br /><br />Still, I like a good coded-puzzle embedded in history, but this Cipher is more just a zero. The writing wasn't bad, but for a clever story, maybe you'd better wait for Mercy to grow up. If all you want is some feminist evangelism with improbable action, Salem’s Cipher may be your preachy choice, but if you want intelligence, logic, and smart choices, find some wise, competent, indefatigable women.

This series has gone down hill fast...,"I don't even have words. I think I honestly skimmed half the book. When this series started, it seemed consistent. There were these amazing characters, and you knew what to expect of them, but you also grew with them. I am not sure what has happened, but this book and the two books before that have gone from bad to worse. It is like mid series the author suddenly decided to change a whole bunch of crucial stuff, wanted more drama, more angst, and didn't know  how to do that constructively and is just rolling with it. The things the characters do and say now have me going ""Are you serious?"". This is book 8 in the series, the characters should be more mature, have a closer bond and we shouldn't continuously have the same problems appear in the same books.  There's plot holes so big in the story line and the characters attributes after book 4 seem to just go all over the place. What. Happened. To. This. Series.",1.0,0,2020
A Must Have BEFORE You Sign a Lease -  Tips Post COVID -- Coffee Sales Skyrocketing,"I bought this book and several others before I opened a coffee shop a few years ago.  I am returning to re-read this (just did) because these author's lay out many pivotal points.  Yes, slightly put off by the UK style of writing and reference to the British Pound but so many observations other books did not cover...this is a must have.  The author's are writing from coffee shop experience and even have ""Types"" of customers down to a tee.  I found that section amusing.  Very enjoyable read.  Anyway by Kindle page 11 I knew this book was worth it!!!  Just what was said right there - was worth it.  *I do not know these authors.<br />2020<br />I own Flavor Laboratories and one thing we flavor are coffee beans - so naturally my coffee shop became my test kitchen.  But I knew little about coffee shops or what to expect back then.  Covid19 caused a HUGE demand for my coffee roasters globally and flavor for the beans because millions of people are working from home and no longer getting ""free"" company coffee!  I found this mind blowing  circa April 2020 and I feel there is no better time to endeavor in the coffee world.  Consumers want to ""experiment"" and re-think their daily coffee.  Coffee is only second to oil as a commodity in demand and why I have always kept coffee in some manner - in my portfolio.  I feel coffee will be barter material also if the currencies begin to flail.<br /><br />Without being a ""spoiler"" I can stress Chapter One in this book is pivotal.  The wrong landlord/lease could be your only mistake (but a bad one.)  If they see you making money, your lease could go way up upon renewal - or they could decide the landlords 'wife' suddenly wants a coffee shop [in YOUR space] or they could put someone who boils collard greens next to your unit (this DID happen to me!) Collard greens stink in case you did not know it...so I would be WEBSITE heavy in my investments so that you retain your customers even if brick and mortars fail or have to be moved.  ""The intangibles.""<br /><br />Hiring as been very hard in 2020 so probably the only big issue most books like these would not know when written.  I can also say ""roasting"" is a whole different ball game and I opted not to roast at my shop because of all the dust and heat.  This book does not get into roasting - which is fine by me.<br /><br />The way I have have always hired is to go into a big place like Walmart, ask a staff a few stupid questions and if they keep smiling and answering..and trying to problem solve for me -- I usually figure out if they have been there long term or just short term.  [Short term is open game] If I like them I pay them twice as much and train them well.  Your only as strong as your weakest link and staff being happy is EVERYTHING for brick and mortars. No one wants to see faces changing.  Invest in your staff.<br /><br />Oh, last thing.  CHECK YOUR WATER SOURCES!  I never thought to test the water coming from the space I was first wanting to rent a space for a coffee shop!  When I did, it was the worst and unfixable due to ground saturation, old pipes, yada yada so I went to distilled water to rule out everything and provide a great tasting cup of coffee.  What was in the water allowed me to break the first Darth Vader lease.  If you spend years attracting a spouse, why would you spend one day to get to know a landlord?  I usually pull the county records to see if they love taking first, last and deposit from a new face every month.",5.0,1,2020
A cute romance,"I liked this book and would have given it 4 stars except for one little part of it.***Possible small spoiler alert****. This didn't even effect the story that much but it bothered me.  I am a retired RN and when Cole needed stitches in his finger, he was given Toredol (a very strong pain reliever).  You definitely shouldn't drive after taking this and yet he drove to a bar and ordered a Bud light. Those three things should NEVER go together.  Authors should do research before they put something like this in the story. It was a cute book, but that one little part bothered me.",3.0,0,2020
Feel the unease,"This novel was first published in 1966. It remains relevant on an important level. It opened my eyes in a very specific way. As a reader, I was able to feel the unease that was part of daily life for the main characters. The story follows a woman who is half black, half white, as she lives through slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. I've read many stories set in this time period, some written by black authors and some by white authors. None of those novels, not even Colson Whitehead's Underground Railroad, incorporated that sense of unease on such an integral, elemental, and strong level.<br /><br />Looking over your shoulder all the time remains a fact of life today for anyone who is in a helpless or minority situation. Right now, an important focus is on being black in America. But that unease is also being felt by millions of people still living in slavery in America and around the world; by persecuted Christians experiencing genocide in certain parts of the world; and by others whose plights are unknown to those of us in the West.<br /><br />Along with its unease, Jubilee incorporates notes of hope, faith, and perserverence.  Those are important messages for us all.",5.0,1,2020
A beautiful mess with a rainbow above.,"I've been so excited for this series to release. Three interconnected standalones by 3 of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Oh how this first book was special. River ""Snake"" Tate and Anastasia ""Rainbow"" Bailey are unique like aliens and unicorns. River is Mr. Big Man on Campus, all the guys want to be him, every girl wants him and he's the 'woo-woo' man to his fraternity. But he doesn't think anyone truly 'sees' him. Ana is that beautiful lavender hair girl who catches all the guys' eyes but has the hardest time fitting in.<br /><br />What do you do when you and a friend fall for the same girl? You help keep the awe in his eyes, or that's the special type of person River is! The connection between the two is constant even as Ana dates his frat brother. When crazy life winding roads twist these two closer together the tension grows. When River and Anastasia are together it just fits, they can talk forever, be comfortable in the silence or enjoy movement to music. Witnessing both of them let go with the other, to trust the other sees them and will be there is truly special. I really loved getting to know the people closest to these special individuals, Benji, Carl and June.<br /><br />I love reading a book about finding the person that accepts you for who you are and not who they want you to be.

WARNING! THIS IS NOT YOUR USUAL PNR READ!,"In response to another reviewer who just couldn't wrap his/her head around the story, that's okay. This is a day-in-the-life-style kind of romance story, one which I absolutely loved! The reader is initially set up to think that it might be about a woman and her over-the-top Irish shifter boss, only to find out that it's all about her boss setting her up with one of his submissives. (Shifter society is all about alphas and submissives. No sin to be from either camp.) She fires her children's babysitter, only to find herself in a dilemma in which she needs to find one NOW right before the school season started. (More like unicorn hunting. You won't be finding one quite that easy, trust me!) So her boss, the head of the local were clan, helps her out.<br /><br />This therian-based book (therian being the scientific reference to weres of may species) is a new one from this writer for me. However, the world-building is very impressive. Well-researched in all areas, including the medical ones! (I'm pretty picky in this department.) I appreciate that all her referencing to modern Gaelic/Irish is immediately translated into something I can understand. I am impressed that Ms. Milo includes more species in the were department, including a few I hadn't read about before. I'm always open to new and exciting species.)<br /><br />I also appreciate a sincere study of the alpha/submissive roles. Being a submissive isn't a sin or an embarrassment, but confusing to those from the outside looking in. I laughed at the thought that having a werewolf as a nanny was considered a status symbol! Imagine that! But submissives, be it male or female, do make great caretaker of one's young, according to Amanda Milo's were world. And they all believe in going to church. Considering the lack of dogma there at the church service, I'd be going back to church soon enough IF it was the were type of church. (Reminds me of Amish church except the weres have their own building set aside for that purpose.)<br /><br />This book, I'm sure, required a lot of research and development, something I now expect from Amanda Milo. You know this is going to be a book I'll be reading and rereading soon enough because of the wealth of detail and not much film-flam talk talk. Every paragraph has something important to contribute to this novel. I only hope we get to see more from this universe.",5.0,1,2020
"Wildly entertaining, excellent history; an instant classic of American history:","This fascinating book is a much-needed history of how America got where it is today. I had trouble putting it down, as it grew more and more interesting with each episodic twist. It is set in St. Louis, at a time the city was the scene for debates over whether black Americans were citizens. The U.S. Supreme Court would eventually rule they were not, with one justice the father of an endangered free black son in St. Louis.  whether Missouri. St. Louis's fight over whether the city, and its strategic foundries, is settled by a gunfight between pro-Union troops led by a German Communist and pro-Confederate forces supported by local slaveowners. The battle was witnessed by future Union generals Sherman and Grant, and Andrew Jackson and other historic figures have ties to the city. Missouri would remain a star on the Confederate flag, and like the rest of America, white supremacy would remain in its heart. This book is enlivened by many dramatic events, but the most compelling drama is the historic path that takes us to where we are in America today, as a nation. St. Louis is a unique time capsule of that journey, because its economy is still ruled by a regressive elite whose forefathers supported the Confederacy, and slavery. But many people are at fault here, including a Democratic Party that expects black votes but does little to improve schools for black children, or health care for black Americans, which lags behind Iraq and Mexico. Many cities in America could locate their own histories in this genesis of Manifest Destiny. Just as the White House was built by American slaves.  This book is important history that should be required reading for all high school students in America-- and by Joe Biden and all leaders of the Democratic party, as we head into the next presidential elections.",5.0,1,2020
Interesting new type of book from Lucy Score.,"While this is definitely different from the typical Lucy Score romcom, it is still an amazingly funny Lucy Score romcom from the very first page! This is a bit of a romantic suspense romcom, with a psychic and a detective teamed up to solve a case. It has all of Lucy's trademark humor from the first sentence to the last sentence, as well as the big personalities that she's known for. Highly entertaining and so enjoyable!<br /><br />Our female lead, Riley Thorn, is perhaps the most reluctant psychic there is. She doesn't want to inherit the family gift, but she can't avoid it. Nick, our male lead, was born to bend rules and avoid commitment, but he can't help but fall for Riley, and boy does he fall fast! He's determined to get her off the list of suspects when her neighbor turns up dead, and of course they encounter all sorts of shenanigans while they work the case together.<br /><br />Lucy Score delivers another instant-classic, fun, memorable read for her readers. Main characters with large personalities that jump off the page, side characters with so many quirks and so much craziness that you can't help but love them, and a plot that always leaves you wanting to just read one more chapter, this book has it all. And you laugh the entire way through this book. So cuddle up with this one in a place where you won't get funny looks when you laugh out loud, and dive in!",5.0,1,2020
4-1/2 Stars for a well-written romance/disaster tome,"I had changed my mind about reading this book a dozen times.  There were reasons, and I'll explain.  But before I do, understand that the book rated 4-1/2 stars for me because the story was well written with enough research behind it that it was accurate as well as soul-wrenching.<br /><br />I had changed my mind because people whose opinions I respect had read the ARC almost a year ago and had rated it lower than five stars, and they had good reason.  I believe that between then and now, there were re-writes because what they said about the book doesn't seem to be on-point now.  The second reason is that, while I don't DISLIKE the writing combo of Jones and Howard, I do find the books lacking as much of that Howard-touch that we see in her independently written books.  Some of that, I believe, comes from the two authors themselves who have divergent writing styles as well as methods/processes that differ wildly from each other.<br /><br />Despite all those things, the book rated 4-1/2 stars.  The story was well researched, from the CME itself to the area the book was written about Wears Valley. I love well researched books, it shows that the author is serious about her craft and that she's willing to learn all she can in order to give her readers the best book she can write. I stopped really liking Insta-love a while back.  While it does happen, and yes, it has happened to me, it is rare, and because the book starts in the middle of the attraction between Ben and Sela, I could accept it more, but it needed a little more background to make it palatable for me.<br /><br />Even the best of people become violent when a live-threatening crisis erupts, and I think that aspect of it was played down in favor of making the book more palatable for most readers.  I don't necessarily find fault with this, so please don't get me wrong, but I DO think that my imagination went to places the authors didn't want to go.<br /><br />As always Howard's words came through, whether written by two people or a hundred.  I read her first story/book when it was published by Harlequin way back when, and have read them all since, except for one. She will always be my go-to author if I want to read a well-researched, well-written romance.",5.0,1,2020

"Interesting Ideas, Limited Strategies","To begin, I am a relatively new trader. I am still trying to increase my knowledge level before I start trading more. I am not in a position to quit my day job and become a full time trader that lives off my trading income.<br /><br />I found this book interesting. It was an easy read and I finished it in less than two days. There was some repetition (as others mentioned). The two challenges for me were:<br /><br />1. There are only 3 strategies listed in the book. The author mentions that he uses up to 12 strategies at any given time. Obviously the 3 you get is a lot less than the 12 he uses. One strategy provided is based on picking the 10 best performers of the S&P once per week. In a market like what we’ve had for the last 10-ish years, this strategy probably would have been very profitable. The reality is many long term investments in the S&P have been very profitable over the last 10 years. I’d be interested to see how this strategy does during different market conditions. The author does provide historical data and theoretical test data to suggest this weekly strategy could outperform the S&P and limit losses during downturns. Time and experience will tell. The other two strategies provided are based on looking for stocks that are either overbought or oversold. At this time (Feb 2020), my scans do not pick up too many stocks that meet the criteria despite the fact that I’m scanning 7K plus stocks. It could have to do with my scan setup, which brings me to issue #2...<br /><br />2. The author does not make any specific recommendations to scanning software nor does he go into depth on how to set up your scans, other than the indicators/filters and the respective values. Obviously how to set up scans depends on the software or site you’re using. If you’re experienced with setting up stock scans, this is probably ok. If you’re not (I’m not) then you have a lot to learn after reading this book. After fumbling through a couple different scanning and screening programs/sites, I settled on two that ran well on my Mac. I loaded the criteria for the 3 strategies listed in the book into each program and ran them. With each strategy, I got different results from each scan of my programs. Sometimes the differences were minor, sometimes they were quite different. To be honest, I don’t know why the results were different. I’ve checked the filters and  parameters over and over and can’t figure it out. This is the challenge when you follow someone else’s setup—there’s no way to check it. Because everyday is different, you can’t check the results of your scan against anything to see if your scan is set up properly. It’s hard to invest money if you’re not confident you’re getting the correct results.<br /><br />An example is when I ran the mean-reversion short strategy. In theory you’re looking for stocks that are overbought and have the potential to decrease. About half of the stocks my two scans detect, are stocks that are sitting at a level of support (when you view the chart). I don’t believe a stock that is overbought would have just declined to a previous support level. So had I blindly invested off the scan, I would have entered some really bad trades. I can accept that perhaps my scans aren’t set up properly but there is no way of knowing what’s wrong. Again, it’d be nice to have something to compare your results to.<br /><br />Finally, I joined the website, which is free to join. There really wasn’t a ton of useful content. A few days after joining, I was sent an email with an offer to do a free 1-on-1 session with the author with the idea that I’d want to sign up for monthly coaching a guidance. The fees he charges are well out of my price range and My portfolio wouldn’t be worth his time. It definitely felt like the book gave you just enough to want more. That additional info would come at a very steep price. If your investing portfolio is less than $100K, I don’t see how working with the author is possible nor do I see a way for the average Joe to learn more of the strategies he talks about using.",2.0,0,2020

Dom is the grumpy hero of my dreams!,"I will admit to having a total girl crush on Ally. She's smart, sharp-tongued, witty, resilient and determined. She does have a bit of excess pride that gets in her way in her relationship with Dom, but you know it's going to be a happily-ever-after because it's a Lucy Score romcom.<br /><br />Dom is grumpy, but despite him protesting to the contrary, he is the grump with a heart of gold. He carries so much guilt for crimes that are not his, and he thinks that he is totally heartless, but what he really needed is a woman to help him let go of the guilt and start living his life for himself. He is legitimately the most protective self-proclaimed grump I've read.<br /><br />Ally and Dom really compliment each other, and they really help each other grow. They are both proud and determined.

Delightful!,"Old Soldiers...was an absolutely delightful read! A murder mystery, without all the bluster and blow of so many British authors' works.  Character development was excellent, and wonder of wonders, they were all pretty likeable, even the victim, though she could be a snot at times. No attempts at social justice warrior-ism are to be found, a welcome state in today's world where everyone seems to have an axe to grind about something. There is a police inspector in the mix, though he has very little to do or say about anything, and he is completely overshadowed by our protagonist, the Old Soldier. High praise for this author! More like her, please!",5.0,1,2020
The alien sounded authentic because he was a bit of a jerk,"I believe the author of this book—meaning, I believe she really did meet a man from another galaxy and ended up going to his world and having his child.  There are just too many things that you would need to know to make this story up and no one is that smart😉<br />For example, I read in one past life regression of a human group of crash landed here and couldn’t survive in our sun’s light because they weren’t used to such a bright sun, another interesting thing was that a being from else where could get ‘planet-sickness’. Elizabeth explains that the sun’s frequency on Metron, her beloved’s planet, was  of a higher frequency so it messed up her heart.<br />Also, the science in the book is incredible and even though I understood some of it while reading it, I still couldn’t explain it.<br />I also believe the author because as much as she gushed over the her ‘lover’ from space, I found him nauseating, patronizing and a more than a little weird. Aside from stalking the author when she was a young girl and rescuing her at times, he waited until she’d had her two kids and was probably in her 40s and maybe past child-bearing years, who knows with aliens—anyway, he swoops her up and dazzles her with his spaceship and promises they’ve been soulmates before so all is well.<br />Well, he looks a bit creepy in the drawing, like an old man, which I’ve heard if one is truly balanced with the universe, aging does not happen.<br />Two, he needs her to have a baby(the old fashioned way), to infuse fresh DNA into his people because they’ve shut their perfect world off from everyone else. Sounds boring to me, especially with the all white horses and cattle.<br />Anyway, this ‘advanced’ alien could have borrowed a hair from the author and gotten all the DNA he wanted, but no, he had to whisk her off to his world, get her pregnant, and then let her get to know her baby for 4 months and then he put her back on earth.<br />Okay, now the poor woman not only has a heart problem that will eventually kill her from being on his planet, but she has to leave her child with this man who promises to visit.—um, no thank you. Next time take my hairbrush and leave me alone.<br />So, to conclude, I believe the author because the alien sounds like a jerk, with advanced equipment. I guess nothing really changes.",5.0,1,2020

Enlightening and Empowering!,"There’s power in women’s prayer. We are more nurturing, compassionate, and natural critical thinkers. We can multi-task while taking things slowly, and we’re more in touch with our innermost feelings and emotions. Society perceives these things — namely the emotional stuff — as weaknesses or as “girly issues,” but they’re not. They are signs of strength. Internal strength is just as, if not more, valuable as external strength, and that is why a woman’s voice is so vital in a church or ministry.<br /><br />WHEN WOMEN PRAY illustrates just how powerful a woman’s prayer can be, and how God uses women to unify and strengthen those around them. T. D. Jakes does a wonderful — and unpredictable — analysis on various women in the Bible, and how their prayers elevated them and those around them. Why unpredictable? Because he touched on various notable female characters, anyone from Mary, Esther, Sarah and Hannah. I expected to read about those women in this book, but I’m surprised that Jakes hadn’t addressed other notable people, like Ruth, Rebekah and Mary Magdalene. Instead, he wrote about the Samaritan Woman, Rhoda (from the Book of Acts), Anna (a prophet from Luke), the bleeding woman, etc. These women — a few of whom remain unnamed — had made their mark in their time because of their unshakable faith and strong prayers, but they get little love from people who study the Bible.<br /><br />Jakes’s takes on women’s prayers are so refreshing. Some modern-day women might interpret his Woman Art Thou Loosed and other studies as “mansplaining” female Biblical figures, but his takes stem from his admiration for the strong women in his life, like his grandmother, mother and daughter. He encourages women to follow their paths, whether that path is as an entrepreneur, a mother, a ministry leader, or all of the above. Love him for that reason! I cannot recommend this book enough. I devoured it from start to finish.<br /><br />Downsides? I would have liked to read his takes on Mary Magdalene and Ruth (he does one on Naomi instead, which is great too). Other than that, this is a must-read. Five solid Ginger and Cinnamon lattes, with creamy oat milk foam.",5.0,1,2020
#1 funniest Breene book!,"I honestly didn’t think Ms. Breene could make a character more laugh out loud funny than Reagan (of the DDVN Series), boy was I wrong.

I also developed quite the crush on Austin, mmmmm yummy.  The other supporting characters are freaking priceless. I liked how the mystery of Ivy House was written, we all “knew” what was coming but the way the mystery was revealed made sense, instead of being annoying like in other books.  The book was very well written.  I definitely recommend jumping on this new series immediately. I love this world!<br />Written in 1st person past tense for Jessie's POV.

A review of the entire series.,"The first book was good, the third was fairly bad.  There's a great world, there's a fine plot, adventure, character development, enemies, hints of darker tidings.  All that you can want... initially.<br /><br />By the third book however... This is a book about stabbing, stabbing, this is a book about stabbing, stabbing...  Oh sure, the occasional bashed skull, and bite and whatnot.  It's a never ending series of melees, and battles on the way to the big final battle that we've been waiting forever for.  Then there's there's some expounding about the basic simple theme of the book, with the chance to listen to various characters philosophize about courage and honor, and truth, and friendship!  We get it.  Please stop, it wasn't that tough of a concept really.<br /><br />The POV switches every chapter, and we check on on the main characters in rotation, without fail, even when nothing is really going on of interest.<br /><br />Grievous bodily harm.  Everyone takes horrific wounds, and yet is up and about in the next scene, and battling through the ""pain.""  How heroic, that they can work around severed muscles with that can do attitude!<br /><br />It becomes tedious and utterly predictable.

Do I tell the truth or try to be nice?,"This is one of those reviews that I really don't want to write.  Jenny is a talented writer, and the story was extremely well put together in regards to grammer, and overall structure.  It was even somewhat imaginative with all of the magical races coming to rescue the planet.  (Although I could do without the guilt trippy environmental messaging.  I get that some people are worried, but until they go off the grid and live a live with no fossil fuels or plastic I really don't want them preaching at me.)<br /><br />However that is not something that bothered me too much.  Its common enough in this kind of apoc litRPG tales that I almost expect it now.  What I did not expect was how the main character Amy Carlton was written *chants of ""Mary Sue"" can be heard in the background*.  And this is something I try very hard to NOT notice because if I do, I will pick a story apart.<br /><br />And the truth is that I can guarantee that I can find at least 2 ""Mary Sue Tests"" that Amy would fail.  She is so much a wish-fulfillment character that it was scary.<br /><br />She's too good at too many things.  Everyone likes her.  Her upbringing was poor (absentee parents that basically bought her love).  But she had great training and built friendships easily.  Heck, her training to be a familiar was where her near perfection just came out in vivid detail.<br /><br />I'm sure that Jenny did not mean to create a character that was this much of a plot destroyer, but she did.  Amy is just so perfect that she bored me to tears.  There was no conflict.  There was no challenge.  it was like reading an outline for a series of interesting and unfortunate events that never develop any real emotional punch because you know how it absolutely has to end.<br /><br />I won't read more of this.  Its a great idea, but I think its several drafts too soon to publish.  Jenny just doesn't have the song right and needed to go back and revise the tale to make it have some pathos.",2.0,0,2020
Major Continuity Issue,"I really enjoyed the story that Ms. Lee wrote, but her editor at Dragonblade publishing failed her. In the book the author explains how Lucas the hero comes to be a door guard at the Lyon Den. Problem is that there are two totally different variations of the story. One with Lucas so sick with fever he passed out and was taken in, after coming in the gambling den to get out of the rain. The second he helped a door guard take down a drunkard and was offered a job.  Obviously the editor didn’t read the book, or if they didn’t recall easy to remember facts. This is the second book in a row, that I’ve read by Dragonblade publishing that had continuity issues in it. I am going to assume the editor skims and doesn’t read. As this isn’t the only glaring continuity error in this book. A character’s name actually changes mid chapter. I could point out others but I think I’ve made my point. I would honestly prefer to be charged more for a book at it be edited properly. I am tired of sloppy editing by mediocre editors, who have let their authors down.  But since there are numerous five star reviews I guess I’m the only one who noticed. It is a shame that a good author was sunk by her own publisher.<br />If the book was fixed for the continuity issues it a solid four star romance, unfortunately I can’t give it those stars.",3.0,0,2020

Historical fiction,"Born in the Purple, by Dora Ilieva is a historical fiction novel set around the 11th century A.D. The story mostly follows the character Anna, the daughter of Emperor Alexios. She is introduced as a young girl and the story follows through her adult life. There are exciting parts of the story where the action is fluid and dramatic. We learn of betrayals, of lust, of conquest. Parts of the story are reminiscent of life in a royal court. However, the writing also lacks in the sudden time gaps that arise, removing any tension or suspense built up to that point. Then suddenly we are taken back in time, or forward in time, where the events are explained, or told, instead of shown. This removes the feeling of closeness with the characters, making it difficult to empathize with their situations. There are some “head hopping” scenes where the point of view shifts as well.

"James Ellroy says ""Doom is fun,"" and he's RIGHT!","Too bad the last story in this anthology was kind of a dud, because almost without exception, all the other nearly 40 tales (this is a BIG slug of fiction) are top-notch—better even than I expected. And I expected a lot, given the reputations of the editors. This book must have been a labor of love, because not only have Penzler and Ellroy combed through what must have been zillions of contenders to find the very best of the best, they have each written powerful front pieces (don't skip them!), and they provide meaty mini-bios for each of the featured authors, suggesting numerous other novels & story collections I plan to check out. I knew I was a crime buff, but little did I know how very much I like literary noir. I was pleasantly surprised, for one thing, that this fiction doesn't feel depressing to me. As I read along, James Ellroy's words, from his foreword/intro, kept echoing in my mind: ""Doom is fun... Doom is fun.""

"Interesting Start, but the world building had major issues","So, another ""epic"" series that I started recently.  This one has a teenage boy basically purchased from his family 8 years before when he tested for some strange magical blood.  Now, he's about at the age where the blood is ""harvested"" which would kill him.<br /><br />Of course, this story has all sorts of secrets and plots and twists, which are designed to make people want to know more.  Sadly, for me the world building had so many issues that the story felt tilted.<br /><br />First, the ""tributes"" are kept in a massive valley with 10 guards for every tribute.  Now, I'll admit to being a bit overly critical of unrealistic worlds at times, and this is one.  For those who don't know Rome at the height of its slave taking never had a ratio as high as 1 guard per slave, which is part of why there were multiple slave revolts in the century before Julius Caesar rose to power.  Slaves were always more common than guards.  Now yes, the Tributes are valuable if they live to reach their Harvest, but that would mean that they would be kept in a smaller area and not abused as was happening here.  There should have been more ""menders"" and other menials to help with food and clothing production, but the tributes were kept as extremely abused slaves.<br /><br />Second, the size of the enclosure was measured in miles and days of travel, but the slaves were not always escorted when sent to the far settlement.  Think about that.  Slave, allowed to walk for miles without guard or escort.  But they don't escape?  Or hide?  Or die?  Yeah, that's what I thought too.<br /><br />And the guards, guarding something the nobles pay very high prices for, are not gentle with their charges.  Again, think about that.  Bruises might not ruin the harvest, but it would mean that you get weaker subjects with less available blood.  And you'd probably have a death count that would be noticable.  So do you really think that the guards wouldn't be watched to ensure that abuse of tributes did not happen?  yeah, I had another question about the plotting here.<br /><br />In the end there are a lot of ""well, I can't agree with the author's thoughts here."" moments.  The world was just not designed to make sense to someone who's read too many stories and also knows enough about historical societies to accept that this world is possible.  And when you don't think the world is possible, the rest of the story doesn't work all taht well.<br /><br />It was interesting, but it just has a few quirks that left me thinking ""it should have been a lot better"" so I give it 3 stars.",3.0,0,2020

"Good story, but...","I was able to get this book for free through a Kindle ad. I love the story. I’m currently on Chapter 10 and can hardly put it down, but there are several things that bother me regarding the writing. There are tons of commas where there don’t need to be any, as well as missing commas where there should be, and the author seems to use certain words and phrases to make it sound like she’s  more intelligent, but they’re either the incorrect words or the phrases just don’t work. One example on words and phrases is in Chapter 9 when the detective gets a call from the assisted living complex his mother is staying. The manager says, “‘Oh, thank you. I certainly don’t want to upset her. She’s interjected such life here,’” “Interjected” means to say something abruptly, especially as an aside or interruption. I think the word she should have used is “injected”.  Just after that, it says that the detective “rang off.” This is not the correct phrase to use. That would be “hung up.”<br /><br />I know it seems like I’m nitpicking, but proper grammar, use of words and phrases, and punctuation are very important, especially for an author. This is why I can only give 3 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: the further I get in the book, the worse the mistakes get, such as quotations in the wrong places and periods being used instead of commas. I’m not sure what to make of Dale Mayer as an author at this point. Probably won’t actually buy anymore of her books.",3.0,0,2020

Breaks Down The Pieces of Landscape Painting,"I've been painting with watercolors for just over six months, using a couple of books, skillshare classes, and youtube tutorials.  During this time I've identified that I like a loose watercolor painting style.  I love the outdoors, but most landscapes seemed too hard.  I've worked through about half of this book now, and am learning so much!  It is my favorite of the resources I've used so far!  I really like that it is broken down into different pieces of the landscape to focus on, so the first projects focus on the sky, then the mountains and so on.  In each section the projects get more complex, but they also review skills from the previous sections and put them together in new combinations.  For example, in the mountains photo I attached, there is a previous project in the sky section where you learn to do a similar color gradiant (which itself built on the monochrome gradient shown in the other photo).  In a project after the mountain one, you do similar shapes.  So I feel like I am actually learning skills in a somewhat systematic way instead of gleaning things from various youtube tutorials.  I think by the end, I'll be much better at taking my own inspiration photo or scene and figuring out how to paint it.  I wasn't an absolute beginner when I started using this book, and I think I would have needed a little bit more practice than just jumping into these projects at the beginning (but you never know, maybe it would have worked).  If you want to learn to paint loose watercolor landscapes, I highly recommend this book!",5.0,1,2020
Two Boys in One,"In 1919, a 12-year-old Irish boy named Shan Keagan sets sail for the United States in search of his long-lost American sailor/father.  After his mother died, Shan had been left in the care of his uncle, who accompanied him on the voyage, but who unfortunately died just as the ship pulled into New York. In order to make it past customs without being turned over to an orphanage, Shan pleads with an Italian family to pretend he is with them. When they agree, Shan's identity becomes Tommy Capello. The pretense was  intended to be a temporary measure, but Shan/Tommy becomes an integral part of the family. He bonds with the family's son and daughter as if they are real siblings. He builds an especially close relationship with older  ""brother"" Nick.  The Capellos are a hard-working family, so Shan is expected to contribute to the household income.  At first he uses his extraordinary vaudeville skills of singing, telling funny stories and performing impressions at a night club, but the family decides that a speak easy is no place for a young man, so he joins Mr. Capello in the plumbing business.<br /><br />An early part of the story follows Shan and his adoptive family for four years. Author Kristina McMorris paints an enjoyable tableau of family life for the working-class Italian immigrants. While they are usually happy, events occur which alienate Nick from the rest of the family, especially from his father and Shan.  Then the action skips to 1935.  In a classic case of ""wrong place. wrong time,"" Shan unwittingly gets involved in a bank robbery and ends up at the infamous prison of Alcatraz. He struggles just to get by and serve his time. His singing talents are discovered, and he is asked by the warden to perform at special occasions for important outside visitors, such as congressmen. Shan becomes a trusted prisoner, who is allowed to work at the warden's garden house. There he surreptitiously and dangerously befriends a young daughter of a prison guard.<br /><br />Shan begins to receive strange, coded messages that could be interpreted to imply that he will be the subject of a prison break, which is the last thing he wants to do. The punishment for such a move could be death (shot on sight) or solitary confinement in the dark, cold dungeons with only bread and water. Extra time would be added to his sentence, and all privileges would be removed. The rest of the book deals with the mystery behind the messages. There were some major surprises, which I dare not reveal in a review.<br /><br />I admire the research Kristina McMorris did to make this story sound real whether the setting was Ireland, New York, or Alcatraz. I gained an appreciation for the immigrant experience and learned a lot I didn't know about the plight of prisoners on Alcatraz Island. It is a very satisfying read, which I highly recommend.",5.0,1,2020
The magic isn't there,"Man (Professor who's a middle aged hunk), takes a group of 12 college age girls into a cave on a underwater archeology expedition and ends up discovering that the cave has a magical portal to a Lost World.<br /><br />Well, Lost World tales aren't new.  Harem tales aren't new.  Dumb MCs (who should be reasonably smart) aren't new.<br /><br />Ok, let's admit it, nothing about this tale is ""new"".  It's pieced together from other plots and in many cases the derivative nature of the writing is rather oppressive.<br /><br />And yet, I have to admit that I did not dislike the story.  It's just that it wasn't magical.  I've read better tales about people in a primitive society trying to survive.  And while I have to admit that harem tales can be fun, I've pointed out in other reviews that many seem to rely on having a main character who just might be able to win a game of chess..... played against a rock.... if they had the advantage of the rock accepting a handicap.  This MC isn't quite that bad, but he's passive far too often.<br /><br />So I will call this one 3 star.  Its fun, its interesting, but it isn't magical.  Its another solid effort to add to the genre, without being anything more than that.",3.0,0,2020

LONG SLOG TO GET TO ANY ELEPHANT STORY,"I'm an ""elephant-a-holic"" and was so delighted to see this book.  Now, I don't think I can make myself finish it. I am just shocked to read the many 5-star reviews. My experience is that it was way too long on details that don't need that type of examination (how long can one talk about building a fence, and finding scat?).<br /><br />Are there some magical elephant moments?  Certainly.  But you have to slog through a lot of poorly written, self absorbed stories to get to those rare moments.  And many of the stories were so puffed up with self importance at the risk and disregard of others  -- only the author's purpose seemed to hold any import.<br /><br />Example:  The author was out with two young rangers and is charged by a elephant.  He tells the young men to stand their ground.  They, amazingly, do. The elephant pulls away at the last moment, but turns and begins to charge again, and again the author tells these men to stand.  They are fearful and scamper up a nearby tree.  To ""teach them"" he leaves them in the tree after describing a group of honey badgers arriving on the scene, and according to the author, the badgers have ""pickaxe teeth and a bear trap death grip.""<br /><br />He drives off!  He leaves them with no way to get back to the reserve but by foot. He is proud of himself for making them have to deal with this situation as punishment.  Hours later when they arrive at his home he thinks, ""They have learned their lesson.""  And what is that lesson?  To do whatever you say even when they fear their life is in danger?<br />The machismo and arrogance of believing it's your choice to decide if someone wants to risk their life or not because YOU tell them to was to me, so disgusting, that I lost any respect for the author.<br /><br />And that was an ""exciting"" part.  Lots, and lots, and lots of tedious details.  So disappointing.",1.0,0,2020
A Great Book if you're looking for reasons to hate yourself,"This is basically a user's manual for why racism against white people is okay, and why you should hate yourself for immutable characteristics you can't control. It serves as yet another cornerstone in the mainstream anti-white narrative. This could be the holy book to the progressive religion. White skin is your original sin, and no amount of penance can save you. You must give up your resources and status to someone else, because you were born with the same color of skin as the people who ended slavery globally and brought democracy and common law to the globe. Meanwhile, the rest of the world lives in actual extremely xenophobic ethnostates, but it is the white man, with their diverse, tolerant societies, that must be brought to task for the crimes of their ancestors. Meanwhile, in Libya and Saudi Arabia and most of Africa, Slavery still exists, women are still brutally oppressed, and dogmatic theology tramples civil liberties underfoot. Just another exercise in raw ideology from morally bankrupt grievance grifters.",1.0,0,2020
"This is a draft, not a finished book. Just like the last 3","This book reads like a 3rd or 4th draft, not a final copy. Just like the last few, it's full of sentence-fragments, ""your"" used instead of ""you're,"" people say things like ""if I need to going out again,"" people who know things they shouldn't know because the author forgot to include the part of the story where they learn them, etc.<br /><br />Inexcusably, there are several places in this installment where the sloppiness totally derails the plot. For instance, in one place Clyde is given a quest to go find 2 things. Then, a few pages later, he says it's 3 things. One of those things he acquired 100 pages earlier but he says he's never heard of it. Then, later, it's 2 things again. This is ""explained"" later but poorly, and still no explanation for why he doesn't remember the item he already has is given. In another part of the book he reads his character sheet and has a spell he hasn't learned yet. A few pages later he learns it. He checks his sheet and he knows a language he hasn't heard yet. 50 pages later he learns it. This is just simple simple stuff that isn't being checked. The book was not edited or proofread at all. Obviously scenes were moved from one part of the book to another with zero effort to reconcile them to their new place.<br /><br />On top of that, once again Clyde gets in a ton of fights and is never even scratched. He's level 9 and in the most dangerous place around, and nothing ever hurts him. He barely has any HP and it doesn't matter at all. In the couple of places where he's attacked, there is no ""LitRPG"" left. We're given no damage totals, no ""you have this much HP left,"" no nothing. Someone just stabs him and he goes ""oh that was bad"" and he's fine. It's ridiculous. No one ever levels up either. Or talks about leveling up. Or talks about how they'll apply their points. Other than the bare minimum of conversation about the character sheet, this has nothing to do with LitRPG anymore.<br /><br />The deaths of certain characters are treated like a joke, and Clyde saves multiple people who just go ""thanks"" and never talk to him again, even though they're 100 feet from him for the rest of the book. Not believable and makes zero sense. Clyde is given numerous summoning items and spells and every time he runs into a bad situation, he refuses to use them. Why? No reason given. Clyde comes up with ""plans"" like ""I have to find 1500lbs of Item Y. I found out where it is now, so I'll just go get it by myself"". How is he planning to transport 1500lbs of Item Y? Why would he bother to figure that out? Then of course when he does it, no one is surprised. Everyone just says ""yeah makes sense you could do that"" when it makes zero sense.<br /><br />Gloomguard is built underground and we're told over and over again that there are tunneling creatures galore in the area but it apparently has no defenses against such creatures. Every single character is a smart aleck, and every single one of them thinks Clyde is funny. There is no variation at all to any of the conversations, you're basically listening to Clyde talk to identical NPCs for the entire book. Every few chapters someone pops up and literally says ""I live in Z country and I hope I see you there one day!"" and it's just an idea stub for Ugland to eventually turn into a book and it's not even disguised as anything.<br /><br />Clyde keeps saying over and over again that he can't sleep, that he's losing control, etc and then he sleeps and loses control anyway and everyone just shrugs. No one makes any effort at all to keep him awake, ever. Even though such a way exists and was used heavily in the previous book. It's bizarre. In another place, Clyde is specifically told ""you will die unless you go and get Item X before you go into this cave"". Clyde then proceeds not to get Item X, no one ever mentions it again, and everything is fine.<br /><br />Two minor characters make a bet on Clyde being able to complete a quest and one of them lends him an item to help. He completes it and the whole thing is never mentioned again. Does he return the item? Is there an interesting convo about how the one person won the bet? No, of course not. Why would there be?<br /><br />The same minor characters keep popping up and hinting darkly about things. Over and over. Do those things ever happen? No, of course not. Why would they? So we have about 20 convo's that go nowhere. And a bunch of characters that serve no purpose except to have convo's that go nowhere. Why? Who knows. A minor character gets mad at Clyde and refuses to help him for no apparent reason. Does Clyde wonder why? No, of course not.<br /><br />Again, like the last couple of books, Clyde has become too similar to Montana. He doesn't think anything through, he never plans, he is careless with his allies, he doesn't care about anything, he is dull as ditchwater, and he just wins every fight by relying on the same move that he uses every time. It's boring. Both characters are essentially sexless in a way that is not believable in the least and after awhile you would think other characters would say ""hey, have you ever noticed how women throw themselves at this guy daily and he never takes them up on it?"" but they never do.<br /><br />It's extremely bad story telling to have a character just say ""you need to go get 5 clams to save the princess"" and then have the hero take a 90 degree turn and start a different quest, forgetting all about the princess. But those are the kinds of things that both of these characters do regularly. Neither of them has any respect for or desire for money, doing ridiculous things like trading 40 mil in gold for an extra dagger that they proceed to never use. Makes zero sense. They spend hours obsessing about the people of the world that they wish they could help and never seem to connect the dots and realize the money they're constantly wasting would help alot. It's very silly.<br /><br />On top of that, this entire installment is just a list of fetch quests that are all accomplished in a couple of hours. The hero has to go kill a monster, he does so and comes back in an afternoon. He has to go in the maze, he goes and comes back in an afternoon. He has to get someone to sponsor him for something, it takes 5 min. In one place he's given a quest that he's told will take 2 days but then he finds a short cut and does it in an afternoon. Riveting stuff. It's like the most boring part of every RPG you've ever played. He goes to the most dangerous place on the continent and spends the whole time picking berries and doing chores for people.<br /><br />The one bright spot is that the plot actually does advance for once. The counter balance to that is that most of the advancement is extremely heavy hinting that's aimed at the Good Guys series, not this one. So why are we all reading this one? I can't figure it out and apparently Ugland just intends for it to be some kind of footnote to his main set of books.<br /><br />Right before the climactic battle at the end, there is a situation which literally requires Clyde to stay in the town while everyone else fights. Requires it. Does Clyde stay in town? No, of course not. This is not a small encounter, it's the entire point of the book and Ugland just treats it as an afterthought. Like ""yeah yeah we already know it's going to be fine, don't worry.""<br /><br />The party does not really help Clyde do anything in this book and some members of the party never leave the hotel room for the entire length of the novel. It's mostly just him solo-ing everything, or teaming up with people who are not in his party while his party waits for him back at the room. Makes zero sense.<br /><br />The humor is missing too, which is a real shame. All we get this time out is a couple of dick jokes.<br /><br />This book is not well-plotted and it certainly is not well-written. I don't even think I would really call it finished. I would not pay money for another Eric Ugland book, ever, unless he decides to stop doing them paint-by-number and dumping them every 2 months and instead actually starts writing them again. As it is, they are a total waste of time and not enjoyable at all.",2.0,0,2020

Not for me,"This was a very painful read but I did finish it. The mistakes in this book are glaring and plentiful! I checked and the author claims this book was edited and proof read, no way was it a professional, had to be a friend. A couple mistakes I can ignore but the quantity of errors in this book prove it was not professionally proofed. The one that really had my teeth grinding was how old is the main character? Who knows since we are given 29, 34, 10 yrs older than another character, and mid thirties? Are we supposed to choose which age we prefer?  No one caught that mistake before this was uploaded? Next problem I had was it was extremely difficult to figure out which character was which at times. Each chapter start has a character name which indicates whose thoughts we are reading however  it still got so confusing the frustration level was near Kindle breaking. Then we get to the first ""real"" sex scene which was so unbelievable I wanted to scream. This scene needed prep, for the reader and Quellcrist (what a stupid name). I think the ""acting"" sex scenes were more believable. Last problem for me was the story had so much build up and then BOOM all loose ends tied up in a neat little bow in like 10 pages? What! It was end of the world over for both guys, to the point one may have been suicidal but after 1 night apart and a couple kisses both could live perfectly happy as things now were?

Misses the Mark,"I was excited to request a review copy of this book from the publisher, as I have done quite a bit of research on sexism in the workplace, especially in the realm of academia and the arts.<br /><br />This book is mistitled: it should read ""Diversity in the California Tech Workplace."" The vast vast majority of interviews were of California-based tech employees, and others were tech employees with unspecified work locations. There were a few interviews of people in other careers, but they were few and far between.  Even the reference section included majority-tech podcasts. This all would have been fine if the book had been titled correctly.<br /><br />The section on ageism in the workplace only covered youth-based ageism, and didn't have any nontraditional second-career employee or person entering the workplace or switching jobs over the age of 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60. Though I know young people can be condescended to on the job, that doesn't compare with the near-impossibility of people near retirement age finding a new position when faced with unemployment. It also doesn't compare with the growing sense of irrelevance and difficulty in navigating the career workplace after 40, especially for women who were more family-focused in younger life. These issues weren't even covered, so the ""ageism"" section was particularly odious, to me.<br /><br />In the religious discrimination section, three of the five interviews were of Christians...the least-discriminated-against religious group in this country. No one of pagan or Buddhist backgrounds were covered. In the gender category, two interviewees disparaged white women and white feminism, but there was no voice from a straight white woman to discuss the diversity of being in a male-dominated field while being aware of her own privilege. There wasn't a section on size discrimination, or even a story about being fat in the workplace. California has a huge fat activism community, especially in tech!<br /><br />Finally, there was a dearth of information about diversity in workplaces elsewhere in the US. How can one truly describe diversity in the most liberal place in the nation without getting a good viewpoint of those who work in other fields throughout the nation. What about the Midwest? The South? The East Coast? I have lived all over the country, and can say clearly that biases have different ramifications and contexts in Nebraska, Illinois, Maine, or New Mexico. This was a short book, but also seems put together without a breadth of career paths and topics. The tech industry seems far removed from most industries in this country.",2.0,0,2020

Horror movie “logic” or magical realism?,"The Newbery Award medal and I have a strained relationship. When I was in elementary school, the badge was a sign of “this is probably a pretty good book.” Then, starting with The Planet of Junior Brown, the Newbery gilt lost my trust with a spate of depressing, weird-but-not-in-a-good-way books exploring “realistic” themes of mental-health issues, family breakdown, abuse, etc., etc., ad nauseam. Nope, I didn’t need more trauma and sadness in my life, even as a sixth-grader. So I went on to Katherine Kurtz, Robert Heinlein (the “juvenile” stories) and Andre Norton. Since then, I’ve occasionally dipped back into the medaled shelf, with variable success.<br /><br />Scary Stories for Young Foxes earned glowing reviews, and seemed like a good bet, in a watered-down Watership Down kind of way. It wasn’t a good bet--but it wasn’t as bad as some servings of Newbery have been. The main problem for me was its immersion in horror-story (lack of) logic. Instead of recognizable animal behavior, a realistic setting, and a sequence of events that made internal sense, Mr. Heidicker went all-in on the Spielbergian “whatever makes this scarier, let’s do that.” Even the physical setting wasn’t clear--in the same environment, we have peaches, centipedes, alligators, blizzards, and a bloodthirsty Beatrix Potter (who spent her life in England, where alligators do not, as a rule, infest small swamps). The action of the story includes equally unnatural elements: Snipping a bit of a fox’s fur lets her understand human speech. Rabies can drive a fox mad an instant after an infected bite, and kill a kit a few minutes later, but also last for months and bleach a fox’s fur and scent into blank whiteness. A dog fox’s territory-marking scent can stupefy and pacify two vixens so much that they seem to be drugged--but lasts only as long as is convenient for the story. And the primary villain is not only a psychopath, charming and savage by whim, but virtually unkillable, returning from the “dead” again and again, a veritable vulpine Terminator. And how long is all this taking? Months? Years? Those weird elements would make more sense if the whole story incorporated dream- or fairy-tale logic, or if there were more frequent magical-realist touches that built up an internally consistent world. Those elements bothered me so much that I couldn’t settle in and enjoy the story/ies.<br /><br />There were good things about the book. The two protagonists, Mia and Uly, are appealing and have distinct voices, and while Uly’s transformation from scaredy fox to confident hero is abrupt, it was nice to see that version of him. The stores are scary, but not too much so for the intended audience. The writing is crisp, clear, and very well done. I’m almost tempted to try another of Mr. Heidicker’s books, one without that treacherous Newbery embossing…",3.0,0,2020
Not much of anything,At 50% I was thinking nothing happened. I was completely bored by her parents. They weren't funny - just annoying and interfering and then suddenly they leave.  I never saw any closeness or love and sharing with her parents. Why were they in the book? They didn't further along the plot. They were just filler.  The dad with his fart blanket and liking/wanting  to be naked like everyone else - why should he care if his adult daughter is in the room? The mom with her silly matchmaking.  Felt like just a bunch of random stuff put together to make a book.  Even the perfect date felt tossed in.  I give 2 stars since I read it - but even the big battle felt like nothing. Also I give 2 stars since I typically love this author.  Maybe I need to give up on this series.  I'm also not buying into the reason for main characters to stay apart.  Manufactured tension?  I do recommend this author and this book had many 5 star reviews.  I just didn't find it funny.  And I didn't feel the tension between characters.  Maybe because I couldn't buy into the reason for staying apart.  The learning magic was glossed over except to say how fast she was at learning it. I like to see the growth - not just be told she is amazing.  I almost gave 3 stars just because I like the author even though I didn't like this book.

Disappointing!,"I bought this book because of the blurb about it being gripping. It wasn't. The other error in my view was the author(male) writing the story from a female's point of view.

There were further inconsistencies with the story- after waking up from a six-month coma, the lead character is released 10 days later from hospital.

One cliché too many,"I did actually finish it, but had the ending figured well before I got there.<br />I felt the author could have done so much more to amplify an interesting setting and feeling of confinement and failed at that. That setting  deserved more attention and history.<br />Partly it was the structure, which may not have been the best choice given the setting and especially the brief time span. The vague hints became annoying. If the idea was to bring more punch to the finish the result was it ended up giving it away.<br />I especially question which characters were given extra attention. The matriarch was certainly one of the more interesting characters along with the sister and neither were given much space.<br />I really can’t recommend it as much more than something to read on the train to pass the time. I could recommend a few books that would be much better for the purpose.<br />To be honest, I’m a little surprised at the raves. I felt it was necessary to add another voice.

Religion ruled, even as old superstitions and ways of past tried to make sense of the horrible death brought on by the Plague.<br />  I found myself looking up words frequently.  As much reading as I do, this came with a vocabulary of its own, thanks to the deep research done by the author, using many of the archaic terms  from  everyday life in those times.  This event DID happen and this is an excellent portrayal of what life might have been like that awful 14 months in the small country village of Eyam.

"There's a ""Truth Teller"" in Every Family.","Every family has its ""truth teller"". Mary Trump whatever her motivation, spoke her truth. For all the wealth, fame and ""position"" in their lives, this entire family suffered needless want and deprivation.<br /><br />It's difficult though to muster up the requisite compassion for their suffering, when they all believe that a person's intrinsic value as a human being is directly related to how much money they have. The entire familial wealth is grounded in having received money to build their shoddy low to mid rent housing in Brooklyn from the USA. They all are loathe to pay their fair share in taxes to the extreme of criminality.<br /><br />How did we as a nation invite the ""Frakenstein"" borne of this tortuous destructive and multi-pathological familial dysfunction into our precious democracy? Did some of us value personality over character? Did we secretly wish for our worst impulses and demons to come out and play to amuse us or even worse, justify our own grievances?<br /><br />When the devil is allowed free reign it is always a horror show. And we have been witness to some horrors these past few years. The death of over 130,000 fellow Americans being the latest and most devastating.<br /><br />It was an entire party and segment of society to include self-described Christians who applauded and enabled the smashing of norms which preserved decency and honor.

""Let the lessers and the poor people do that."" Moreover, they think themselves above the rules of civil society and even the laws which preserve justice for all...even the poor man living and dying on the street.<br /><br />Every soul on earth is a teasure. Come to think of it...I believe that the reason the family, Mary Trump describes in her book,  lived so poorly and suffered so much is because they squandered their true treasure by by not valuing each other for their intrinsic worth while acquiring a billion dollars of assets underserving their customers and cheating the government.",5.0,1,2020
There it is: Kindle on my iPhone!,"I saw the article about this on the Catholic News Agency website. It just sort of grabbed me! I have been wanting to do something. I wasn't sure what though. The first thought that went through my mind when I saw this was how I was advised by a dear devout aunt years ago to pray the Litany of Saint Jospeh, because I was changing jobs, careers, relocating, and just experienced an engagement breakup. The second thought was reading about how devoted Saint Teresa of Avila was to Saint Joseph and how she appealed to him and how things changed in her life. The third thought was the book [[ASIN:0906138493 Joseph the Silent]], given to me to read by another aunt that gave me a new understanding and appreciation for this saint and changed the whole way I thought about him. Now I feel maybe more personally invited to follow this path of consecration, although it feels compelling, I was rather describe it as ""being drawn."" You can see in the picture, the book is already on my iPhone. One of the days suggested for consecration is May 13th, the feast of Our Lady of Fatima. That seems right to me because there's a special connection there that came through one of these aunts. Now, to make time!",5.0,1,2020
Falls Flat,"Lots of flying and little plot.  I expect more from Nalini Singh and her Guild Hunter Series, than this book which actually bored me at times. I’ve never been bored by a Singh book prior but this one did it. I really like Sharni and Titus, but the actual plot had none of the grit that I expect from a Singh book. I don’t know why we as readers had to read letters from the past that gave no context to what was happening in the book. Could not have Sharni and Titus have talked about their past in relationship to the events in the letters. I understand that they were supposed to fill in Titus backstory, but that backstory did propel the plot at all.

Not very illuminating,"To someone who knows anything about shadow work or is familiar with Jung teachings this is not the book for you. The author (who doesn't even mention Jung once) is repetitive and explains why it is important to acknowledge and heal our shadows through 90 percent of the books while the actual work of it is simple journaling tasks that could have been found on any blog about shadow work on the internet. Not worth the money, in my opinion even for someone who has never heard of the shadow. Do your homework and learn it from Jung.",1.0,0,2020
Challenging Set,"First up, the premise of the storyline is quite fun and the entire collection was dirt cheap on Amazon. This is where the happy review ends.<br /><br />All of the books need a serious editor who is proficient not only with general proofreading and grammatical errors, but also with story continuity.  There are glaring messes along the way which trip the reader with a “wait ... what!?!”.<br /><br />The author is clearly an inexperienced writer and that comes through immediately with the writing.  Unfortunately that issue continues through each book, with the jerky relating of the storyline, the lack of character(s) development and the uncomfortable dialogue between those characters.  The way the characters interact with each other is more often than not quite immature and I began to wonder if the author’s intended reader was a young to mid teen?<br /><br />All of these issues were so painful for me that it made the books an uncomfortable read and although I’m one who usually finishes what I start, I couldn’t do it here.<br /><br />I would encourage this author to get a professional editor who is more proficient with writing to mentor her with future publications.",1.0,0,2020

"If You Liked Twilight Zone, You Will Love This Book!","Back in the 60s, ""The Twilight Zone,"" produced by Rod Serling, was one of my favorite television shows.  I still enjoy the special marathons that are rebroadcast today. The elements that so intrigued me then and now are the combination of paranormal events, philosophy, and ethical choices faced by the characters.  All of those elements are present in ""If Cats Disappeared From the World,"" by Japanese author Genki Kawamura.<br /><br />Our protagonist is a 30 year-old postman who finds out from his doctor that he has only months to live.  As he retreats to his home to ponder his fate, the devil appears, wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Of course, the devil is ready to bargain. The devil informs him the doctor glossed over things, the young man will actually die tomorrow. However, the devil will give him one extra day, if the young man agrees to deprive the entire world of an object, any object.  After a short discussion, the devil suggests the elimination of smartphones and the young man agrees.  Suddenly, there are no smartphones.  No one misses their smartphones, because they have never existed at all anywhere.<br /><br />Without giving away more specifics, suffice it to say that the devil comes back multiple times with the same offer.  The young man can live one more day if the world is deprived of just one thing. The young man doesn't have a bucket list, per se, but he does have regrets, chief among them the breakup with a girlfriend and his estrangement from his father following the death of his mother.  During these daily crises, the postman is comforted by his cat, curiously named ""Cabbage,"" whom the devil imbues temporarily with the ability to speak. As the title of the book implies, there are consequences to every decision.  Just the way Rod Serling would have written such a dilemma.  I loved this book!",5.0,1,2020
I'm not Black but I'm queer and allied and this book is everything.,"I really love adrienne maree brown's work - incredibly insightful and inspiring stuff that feeds my soul and educates.

I admit I had a harder time trying to decipher Emergent Strategy when I first read it, but since then, I've followed adrienne maree brown around on the internet learning to grasp these concepts more deeply, and this book actually offers a LOT of clarity for the questions I had (I'll probably go back and read ES again once I'm done with this one). It's a hard book to read during quarantine time, living in a tiny rural town with a lover who lives four hours away, but it ain't the worst of peoples' problems right now.

"How well do YOU know your ""friends""?","This book gave me nightmares. I can't remember the last time that happened. Movies, yes, because they are a visual medium. But not even the goriest Stephen King book has given me a nightmare, perhaps because they are more phantasmagorical and less reality-based. In this book, the description of the wounds caused by the accident, the way the characters suffered from the cold, the struggles of those who left the vehicle to try to find help, and the callous actions of some of the characters seemed all too real. I read the first half of the book yesterday evening and later that night, in bed. Obviously that was not a good decision. I'm just mentioning it so that others who have a vivid imagination and are powerfully influenced by words as well as images will be aware of my experience.<br /><br />This book is well written, but it brings up the same question I've had with similar books, such as The Lovely Bones and If I Stay: If the narrator is incorporeal, how is she telling the story? I realize sometimes readers have to suspend disbelief, and as the author mentions in her note at the end, the use of Finn, who dies in the accident, as narrator allows her to peek in on the other characters when they are alone as well as pick up on their thoughts and emotions. It is a much more personal approach than writing from a standard omniscient point of view.<br /><br />Despite my nightmares, or perhaps because of them, I am giving this book four stars, which equal five stars from most reviewers. I reserve five stars for recognized classics or books I feel should be classics.<br /><br />FROM THE AUTHOR'S NOTE<br /><br />Dear reader:<br /><br />This story was inspired by an event that happened when I was eight years old. At the time, I was living in upstate New York. It was winter, and my dad and his best friend, “Uncle Bob,” decided to take my older brother, me, and Uncle Bob’s two boys for a hike in the Adirondacks. When we left that morning, the weather was crisp and clear, but somewhere near the top of the trail, the temperature dropped abruptly, the sky opened, and we found ourselves caught in a torrential, freezing blizzard.<br /><br />My dad and Uncle Bob were worried we wouldn’t make it down. We weren’t dressed for that kind of cold, and we were hours from the base. Using a rock, Uncle Bob broke the window of an abandoned hunting cabin to get us out of the storm.<br /><br />My dad volunteered to run down for help, leaving my brother Jeff and me to wait with Uncle Bob and his boys. My recollection of the hours we spent waiting for help to arrive is somewhat vague except for my visceral memory of the cold: my body shivering uncontrollably and my mind unable to think straight.<br /><br />The four of us kids sat on a wooden bench that stretched the length of the small cabin, and Uncle Bob knelt on the floor in front of us. I remember his boys being scared and crying and Uncle Bob talking a lot, telling them it was going to be okay and that “Uncle Jerry” would be back soon. As he soothed their fear, he moved back and forth between them, removing their gloves and boots and rubbing each of their hands and feet in turn.<br /><br />Jeff and I sat beside them, silent. I took my cue from my brother. He didn’t complain, so neither did I. Perhaps this is why Uncle Bob never thought to rub our fingers and toes. Perhaps he didn’t realize we, too, were suffering.<br /><br />It’s a generous view, one that as an adult with children of my own I have a hard time accepting. Had the situation been reversed, my dad never would have ignored Uncle Bob’s sons. He might even have tended to them more than he did his own kids, knowing how scared they would have been being there without their parents.<br /><br />Near dusk, a rescue jeep arrived, and we were shuttled down the mountain to waiting paramedics. Uncle Bob’s boys were fine—cold and exhausted, hungry and thirsty, but otherwise unharmed. I was diagnosed with frostnip on my fingers, which it turned out was not so bad. It hurt as my hands were warmed back to life, but as soon as the circulation was restored, I was fine. Jeff, on the other hand, had first-degree frostbite. His gloves needed to be cut from his fingers, and the skin beneath was chafed, white, and blistered. It was horrible to see, and I remember thinking how much it must have hurt, the damage so much worse than my own.<br /><br />No one, including my parents, ever asked Jeff or me what happened in the cabin or questioned why we were injured and Uncle Bob’s boys were not, and Uncle Bob and Aunt Karen continued to be my parents’ best friends.<br /><br />This past winter, I went skiing with my two children, and as we rode the chairlift, my memory of that day returned. I was struck by how callous and uncaring Uncle Bob, a man I’d known my whole life and who I believed loved us, had been and also how unashamed he was after. I remember him laughing with the sheriff, like the whole thing was this great big adventure that had fortunately turned out okay. I think he even viewed himself as sort of a hero, boasting about how he’d broken the window and about his smart thinking to lead us to the cabin in the first place. When he got home, he probably told Karen about rubbing their sons’ hands and feet and about how he’d consoled them and never let them get scared.<br /><br />I looked at my own children beside me, and a shudder ran down my spine as I thought about all the times I had entrusted them to other people in the same way my dad had entrusted us to Uncle Bob, counting on the same naive presumption that a tacit agreement existed for my children to be cared for equally to their own.",4.0,1,2020

Angels ARE Intelligent,"I rarely write negative reviews but I had to write this one. The author says in chapter three, page 32 of his book that ""angels do not have brains and nervous systems through which their thoughts need to be filtered, that when an angel decides to reject God, that descion is irrevocable, because there is nothing for the angel to ever reconsider. Since the angel is pure Spirit, the angel doesn't ever experience any growth or maturity of character that might give him a greater ability to see his error."" I deeply disagree with this. I believe that angels are quite capable of making right and wrong decisions. Decisions that affect them and humankind on earth and in the Heavens. Angels are not robots. They are intelligent created brings that have great capacity to think, act, serve, and protect at the request of God and the humans in their charge. And I'm thankful for the strength and intelligence of God's angels for they are involved in my life and the life of my family everyday. Thus my rating of two stars for this book.",2.0,0,2020

Confusing premise,"Nomadland by Jessica Bruder<br />I hoped for more from a book about the transient life of older adults living on the road.<br />The pieces are all in place: good descriptions of grueling temp jobs, interesting interviews, detailed first-hand accounts of social gatherings.<br />Somehow, though, I couldn't lose the impression that I was reading a series of essays from a beginning anthropology student--one talented in writing yet missing connections.<br />Bruder depicts individual circumstances, but she doesn't provide a clear premise: is the book supposed to be a collection of anecdotes? A statement on classism? A shoutout to the survival of human spirit during crisis? Maybe all that and more?<br />Whatever the intent it only partially works. It fell apart for me with Linda and the place she picked to create her permanent earthship home. I wish Linda only the best, but found Bruder tonedeaf regarding that situation.<br /> My take is the author seems naive.  But, well, she's on her way back to the city and a book deal (now a bestseller and movie); so, projection maybe why she felt the need to throw white privilege into the mix?

So our MC who only finds out that he's the son of a god when he's 26 has women throwing themselves at him after he's summoned to the school for such demi-gods and goddesses.<br /><br />Of course, there must be a conflict and in this case its a series of major disasters surrounding the long time hidden fight between the demi-goddesses and the children of the monsters their parents fought back in all those stories we now consider myth.<br /><br />I love the concept and overall there are so many little things done right, but the school was done so wrong and the rest of the story ended up suffering.  There were leaps of illogic that just fed greater leaps later and a severe lack of sense (common or otherwise.)<br /><br />Fun, but I've pretty much decided not to continue this series.

The author did a good job handling how she could write this story and still have it be clean and uplifting but I almost wish that it hadn't had the happily ever after ending that it did and that is saying something coming from me. Normally I ONLY want a HEA.<br /><br />I liked that both the main characters were honorable even though they fell in love while she was not free to love another. They are both innocent in the unfortunate situation and strive to do what is right rather than gratify themselves. And I liked that Tabby worked so hard to be positive even though it would be easy to give up and be miserable.<br /><br />I didn't like that I spent the entire book waiting and hoping for someone to die or divorce. That makes me uncomfortable. Her husband was a louse from the start and I really didn't like him at all but my sense of loyalty to marital vows just made the whole situation difficult. I just couldn't see any scenario that I was going to be thrilled with.<br /><br />This book portrays some of the difficulties for women in that time period. Really Tabby has no good alternatives for the horror that is her life. If she leaves her husband, she could/would lose her child. So even though it was disturbing to me that she has to leave her son in the care of her louse of a drunkard husband in order to work it is her only alternative. Even more disturbing is her husband's attitude about working and caring for his family.

It’s like The author didn’t know where he wanted to go with the story or how he wanted to wrap it up.<br /><br />The characters seem hallow. Joel was fleshed out mostly, but nobody else really was. They all felt generic. The author relies on lazy stereotypes; backward closeted southerners, gun happy angry southerners, promiscuous gay men, mean cheerleaders, bags of bones. The plot is also really predictable. As soon as the murder mystery kicks off automatically know who they’re going to try to frame for murder. The whole reveal of what the bright lands were was utterly and completely ridiculous and unrealistic.<br /><br />The author seems to want to accomplish too much. Is this a murder mystery? Is this a paranormal horror type cult thing? I really don’t think that he combined the two well. This book with a huge let down.",2.0,0,2020

But words cannot express my disappointment in how the plot ended up in regards to Beth. It icks me out. Seriously. The fact that his mate slept with his brother (granted, it was before they ever met) and that his brother slept with his mate, even with the excuse of being drunk, when he had a feeling she might possibly be his brothers mate, is bad enough! But to have fathered her child?!?! UGH! Now, when the brother meets his mate he'll have to explain to her how he is the father of his brother's mate's child. It seriously gives me a nasty feeling.<br /><br />If I didn't like the characters in this series so much, and the overall general plot, that alone would have gotten a one star rating from me. That's not romance, it's just awful, no matter how the author tried to spin it. But, to be fair, I decided to give it a very low three, maybe a 2 1/2, because the writing was great, the characters were great, and the plot was good (other than that part).<br /><br />To be honest, I'm kind of glad the next book isn't out yet because it's going to take me while to work up enough enthusiasm to dive back in to this world after that HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.

"Sadly, Underwhelmed","I have read virtually all of Ms. Colgan's books and particularly enjoyed the Mure Island series. She does a fine job of putting the reader in the place, a small isolated island with unforgiving weather and a colorful, enjoyable cast of characters. This time, however, in Christmas at the Island Hotel, I didn't feel the same affinity for characters, especially Fintan. If Colton was the ""love of his life"" and since he was left this magnificent property that Colton so wanted to grace the island, why wasn't he appreciative?  Why sulking like a teenager? Why did he feel Flora was butting in when it was she who was responsible for it's  opening? And don't get me started on Innes' child Agot. Eloise of famed books was a pussycat next to this one.  Parts of this book were reduced to farce - the ridiculous dog episode at the soft opening of the restaurant being one.  I so wanted to be transported to the island and learn what happened to favorite characters, but I was left wanting.  I will certainly read future books, but I hope they are more cohesive like ones that preceded Christmas at the Island Hotel.

Basic story OK- but ....,"The basic story is OK, but:<br />* W-A-Y too drawn out with irrelevant back stories and unnecessarily detailed descriptions.<br />* Far too much pontificating and rehashing of the likely outcome and variations of the plot.<br />* Improbable scenarios, situations and actions.<br />* Seemed like the author kept dreaming up situations with the sole aim to increase the word count...?<br />Disappointing, really - had to keep skimming great tracts of script!!",3.0,0,2020
This book was not for me,"I could not enjoy this story. Colby just isn’t a very good character. He is an almost 30 year old man who has spent the last year hanging out pretty much exclusively with high school girls. He counts a girl who just graduated as his best friend. At worst it’s super creepy and weird, at best it’s massive Peter Pan syndrome. That in enough is enough to turn me off of the book. I can not imaging being a woman who was already in love with him before being ok coming into this dynamic. I’d think it was creepy and pathetic. When you add the fact that he was a dbag of epic proportions when he broke up with her. He left her a note on a bed and never looked back. He didn’t check on her or mourn her. She wasn’t his one true love. He immediacy became a ho and again never looked back. He is angry at her for “hiding” his child, but she never hid. He literally changed his phone number and didn’t reach out to her once. If he had been a normal person who reached out to her to check in her after bailing completely, he would have known about her. He was to worried about people taking advantage of him and he did nothing for her when he signed his NFL contract. He didn’t want to share his fame and wealth with her. He didn’t want to be tied down. But his (little girl) high school best friend? She has his number, he just paid for 4 years years of college for her, and her apartment. While the heroine and her daughter are living with no support.  He is the person to blame for missing the first 5 years of his daughters life he is just not a good person, and I found none of this sexy.",1.0,0,2020
Knife and Fork,"The ideas are creative, especially if you define sandwich as something inserted between two other ""things"". No-bread sammies aren't great finger food because fillings can fall out.  Actually a knife and fork work better as many of the bread substitutes are moist, cold, or hot, maybe. Room temp grilled chicken doesn't have much appeal.  A traditional sandwich is portable but a polenta ""sandwich"" is definitely more suitable for a knife and fork.  Still, it's an interesting book that could give you ideas, even for a more traditional approach.",4.0,1,2020
"A perfect read for winter, 2020","I love this book so much. After reading a review of it on NPR, I knew it would be an appropriate read for our pandemic winter. It's a poetic memoir with no particular plot line, but the author's writing is thoughtful with occasional punches of humor. I found it very relatable; looking into my own experiences of wintering, past and present. It's offered my a new perspective on life's difficulties, particularly now with the challenges the year has presented me (and the rest if the world). This is a book that  can be read in a day or savored over time. I'm already itching to read it again, and I never re-read books.",5.0,1,2020
COMPLETE AND DETAILED,"Probably the most superior and complete account of the final days of the Pacific war. The military analysis is clear and comprehensive written in a smooth and uncomplicated prose. I was deeply moved by the dedication of very ordinary young American boys taken from their homes and dumped in the Pacific war. The same goes for the other ""side of the hill"". Although the author makes many stabs at  explaining what the Japanese hoped to gain there is still a mystery why otherwise rational people should embark upon an irrational course. This deep irrationality could only  have been sustained by descent into a cult of death. Yet this was switched off immediately at war's end. Still difficult to fathom.",5.0,1,2020
Lovely story with charming and heart touching friendships,"I enjoyed this book so much, and found myself reading straight through to the end!  It was interesting to learn about each of these ladies, the triumphs, the ups and downs of their lives, and the love they all shared with each other.  Having moved from one end of the US to the other and then marrying a USN man and moving to a number of Naval bases, I have always wondered what it would be like to have life long friends.  I did however enjoy meeting people from all over, and always was lucky to find a few special friends each place we lived, and it was wonderful to live in so many varied and beautiful areas.  I guess I'm a gypsy at heart, but I always wondered.......and now maybe I know.  Thank you so much, Jessie Newton!  Back in the day we didn't have the internet, it was snail mail or expensive long distance phone calls, moving all the time made it very difficult to keep in touch.  Book 2 in the series is now in my library and Book 3 is preordered.  I strongly recommend giving this series a read, all the little twists and turns and surprises will have you captivated.",5.0,1,2020

"""Streets raised us. Horses saved us.""","I want to thank HarperCollins Publishers for sending me an ARC of The Compton Cowboys as part of a Goodreads Giveaway on the understanding that I would read and provide a fair and unbiased review.<br /><br />As a primarily fiction reader/reviewer, I often struggle on how to review the non-fiction I do read. So I will say, I pick the non-fiction I read based on if the topic it is about captures my interest and if I finished the book, did it hold my interest throughout (which is the hardest metric for any non-fiction book to meet with myself personally as a reader.)  On those two measures alone, I feel comfortable giving this book a solid 4 star review.<br /><br />So what about The Compton Cowboys captured my interest? I will be honest, it wasn't the fact it was about black cowboys. I was aware black cowboys existed and the role they played in the expansion of the American West. (If this is a topic that interests you, let me recommend the highly digestible, incredible well researched historical romances of Beverly Jenkins that highlight the role of African-Americans in Western expansion following the Civil War. Historical fiction, of all genres, is a fabulous way to make history less dry when you read well researched ones.) No, my interest was captured the moment I realized there was any type of cowboy, riding any kind of horse in modern day Compton. It was the kind of interest one got the first time you heard about Jamaican bobsledders, because hello??? When does it get cold enough in Jamaica to ever have a bobsled? Well having grown up listening to West Coast rap, my mind could not wrap itself around the idea of horses in any form in Compton, much less a human of any race riding them there.<br /><br />How could this be? Was there some secret oasis leftover there from the ""wild"" west days, right in the middle of Compton that we didn't know about??? Well sort of... it isn't quite that simple, but the ""Farms"" in Compton are a leftover from the original settlement of the town, but how they became their current ""unknown"" ""oasis"" state is a bit more complicated and the story of both lack of publicity and white flight from the cities. First the unknown part, I would say, lots of old cities have green oasis in them or on the edges on them, we just don't think about them or they aren't widely known if they haven't been the topics of literature or film. Examples of common known city oasis: Hyde Park in London, Central Park in NYC, The Common in Boston, The Mall in DC. These are all places people in old cities got outside, rode their horses, walked back in the day and their modern citizens still make use of these spaces. The Farms, in a much less structured way, act as that green space in Compton, it was a haven area to raise families away from the factories that were built up for the wars. Families moved to California and Compton looking for those jobs and a better life as the second Western migration occurred in America in the 20th century. Horse owners from other parts of rural America brought their horses with them, establishing a horse culture in the Farms that continued as whites left the city and the neighborhood transitioned to the more black neighborhood that gain cultural notoriety for its gang violence in the late 80s and 90s in the music of N.W.A. and Dr. Dre. to finally the current ethnically mixed neighborhood discussed with continued complex issues of poverty and violence in Kendrick Lamar's lyrics.<br /><br />In this complex place, with incredibly complex problems the long history of horse culture has allowed for a sub culture of black cowboys to exist in the middle of the continuing gang violence on the streets. That is where the readers find the Compton Cowboys. They are now grown men (and a woman) who were raised as children/teens with horse in Compton and on the Farm and with horses they found sanctuary from the dangers of life outside the Farm and are trying to figure out how to continue the mission of the Farm for the current generation of kids in Compton. ""Streets raised us. Horses saved us."" They face this challenge as ownership and leadership of the Farm changes hands, previous funding dries up, they face their own personal demons, and they work to redefine what it means to be a modern black cowboy.<br /><br />As for my second metric of readability. This book was written by a New York Times reporter and the best way I know how to describe the style is that it is a series of New York Times Magazine articles. So that each segment of the book can stand alone as an insight into part of the lives and struggles of these individuals and yet each builds towards a greater understanding of the whole. It worked really well for a subject that there is not a tidy, pretty ending. It is a collection of insights into living breathing people who are in the middle of figuring it out. The Compton Cowboys' stories are interesting and people should know about them and Walter Thompson-Hernandez has captured them well.",4.0,1,2020
Adulting is Hard. So is Beyond Humaning.,"There are plenty of other reviews listing downsides to this particular entry into Jim Butcher’s Dresden series:  Battle Ground and Peace Talks should have been one, much more tightly-edited and logically-paced work. The battle part of the title went on way too long, the cast of characters is bloated and sometimes their motivations are unclear.  Readers repeatedly get conked on the head with messaging about Things Changing or illustrations of demi-gods, indeed, having demi-god-like powers.  All of that’s true.<br /><br />Here are some additional critiques (or perhaps just observations) I haven’t seen, which I’ll make in a SUPER SPOLIER-Y WAY SO QUIT READING NOW IF YOU DON’T WANT THAT.<br /><br />I mean it!<br /><br />First, and foremost, with Murphy’s death Harry has lost one of the single, most enduring and important adult relationships he has had.  While he and Karrin haven’t been lovers long at all, they loved each other for much, much longer. Karrin was Harry’s best friend and touchstone, and losing her would be like the death of a spouse.<br /><br />Here’s the rub:  People who have lost spouses don’t act like Harry does.  Sure, he shows rage and pain in several scenes.  But he never suddenly has to sit down for, really, no reason other than because he’s been side-swiped by unexpected grief.  We don’t see him going through the motions of his day, but not reacting or thinking as he usually would.  These are hallmarks of bereaved people.  What we’re given instead, in the Christmas scene tacked to the novel’s end, is Harry being saddened (seemingly in general, since Karrin’s name never comes up) and then giving himself a pep talk.<br /><br />I can think of only two reasons for this.  One, it’s poor writing (not what I expect of this author).  Or, two, Butcher is illustrating what it means to be something other than human, perhaps not as adeptly as he might.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that, all along, it’s been Harry’s sheer ability to endure that that has intimidated so many people he’s soul-gazed.  Lots of readers like to observe Harry is mentally disciplined.  In fact, he’s straight-up scarred, and by dint of his life experiences, especially since Changes, he has been tempered into one scary person.  It’s both a gift and curse, and, at Battle Ground’s end, we listen to Harry explore some of this in his conversation with Mab, who is far ahead of him in the post-human transition.<br /><br />Is Harry able to function in the aftermath of Murphy’s death because he’s no longer like any other frail human who has lost so very much?  Repeatedly, Karrin assures Harry that she will keep him human.  After Harry’s exchange with Mab, and what we watch him go through in this book alone, I was left wondering if staying human is really what will serve Harry as he takes on yet *another* role being handed to him, that of Star Born.<br /><br />This raises my second point.  On the upside, Battle Ground continues an aspect of Dresden Files that sets this series ahead of most others, i.e. it evolves its central character.  Peace Talks pretty much set Harry up to push against the pre-defined roles the rest of the world has consistently tried to fit him in to:  White Council Member, Grey-Cloaked Warden, Winter Knight, etc.  All of these mantles, if you’ll forgive the pun, come with sets of expectations around them.  In Battle Ground, we at last see Harry really start to live--not just in snarky opposition to others’ expectations--but outside of them, defining his life in his own way.  Deciding what aspects of a role to take or leave, and what roles to abandon, is one of the key tasks of adulthood.  Butcher demonstrates great wisdom as he draws Harry toward becoming The Wizard of Chicago.<br /><br />Unfortunately, five books after Changes, Harry is still in the process of establishing several other essentials to the adult (wizard) life--much less Wizard of Chicago.  And it doesn’t necessarily make for engaging pacing to pause in the promised trajectory toward the Big Showdown with the Outsiders and Nemesis while he does these things.<br /><br />He’s got a lot to accomplish.  Harry at least stopped procrastinating getting a home of his own and discovering more about the weapons at his disposal, that’s a start. But, we learn that he may also need to go back to school and Apprentice (capital “A,” another role) with River Shoulders so he can have even a hope of not-dying when the Big Showdown does finally come.<br /><br />To complicate matters further, Harry’s opportunity to have a family of more than two seems to have been confounded, since Butcher has taken Murphy, Thomas, and Ebenezer out of play either entirely (ostensibly) or temporarily.  This leaves Harry even more alone than usual, and potentially stuck with Lara—a character for whom Harry’s seemed to have a sneaking fondness for multiple books, yet will take lots of work to turn into a friend, much less a partner like Karrin.  (Aside:  What on earth did happen to Bonea, or Bonnie, since it's spelled both ways? Harry spares her nary a thought.)<br /><br />While all of this certainly creates interest, it also presents quite the writing challenge.  Butcher ought to be up to it.  But he got so bogged down in Battle Ground and Peace Talks, I can only hope he and his editors take a more firm red pen to the next round.",3.0,0,2020
Hard pass,"I was lulled into this book by the huge number of 5 star reviews and the fact that it was available on KU.  I’m just glad I didn’t have to pay for this poorly written book.  Between the word choice errors, awkward sentence structure, and eye-rolling cliches, I felt like an English teacher reading a high schooler’s attempt at creative writing.  When I start highlighting badly written passages as I did about 15 pages into this book, I am ill disposed to think very highly of the book going forward.<br /><br />For this reader, the most egregious flaw arises out of the author’s attempts at character development.  I don’t think there is a character cliche that she’s overlooked: the cold, calculating bad boy with a heartbreaking secret, the good-as-gold, beautiful and sweet, heroine, the not-too-bright but heart-of-gold younger brother, the gum-chewing, vacuous PA, the menacing gangster threatening our heroine, the bad boy’s heartless father, his trampled-upon but loving mother...the list goes on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the marriage-of-convenience premise also does not rise above cliche level.  He secretly lusts after her, she’s always had a crush on him.  It’s just all been done before and frankly this book does nothing to set itself apart from its fellows.  So, bottom line, I recommend you give this one a hard pass as this is not the kind of relationship I care to read about.",2.0,0,2020

We had to change the orientation several times awkwardly.<br /><br />Nice book to have her snuggle in my lap, just jump in, and read aloud.

The spinoff!,"No spoilers here: If you're a sword of truth fan, you're going to love the latest volume of the Nicci Chronicles.  I think what's rather beautiful about this series is that it stands on its' own for the most part.  Why 5 stars?  Because for the couple of days that I had my nose buried in this book, I was somewhere else.  I was with Nicci and Bannon and Nathan, rallying against the dark forces that seem to always pop up in their world.<br /><br />I have a tendency of cruising through Goodkinds books.  When I first learned of the sword of truth series, I think I spent a few weeks catching up.  For me, that's the mark of a talented writer.  Someone who can transport the audience to another place or another time.

Lost the spark,"This book lost all the spark and magic the first one did. I don't know what happened to it. The first book the relationship between the two characters built and evolved. You got to peek under Ian's nonchalant law breaking exterior. You got to see the zings and the tension between the law abiding Veritas and Ian's apparent ""couldn't care less"" attitude. The climax left you wanting more<br /><br />This book felt like it was hitting the check marks. Unknown sibling? Check! Long lost friend presumed dead? Check!Teenage emotion angst? Check! Story line that seems to be plodding along? Check! Rehashing the first book frequently? Check! Throw sex in to try to ""live things up""? Check!<br /><br />Veritas came across as a very whiny teenage-y type character. What happened to the Centuries old tough law guardian that took no crap? The one that snuck mixed breeds/innocents from the council users? The courageous vampire who obviously fought many ghouls, vampires and demons seemed to have disappeared. The emotional growth the book had potential for flopped. She knew why she did what she did but then  it was all angst and not the rational/logical vampire she is.<br /><br /> Ian seems to have the sensitivity of a gnat and it turns around to blaming Veritas and she self blames as well for the reason why he was left. (Not going into to much depth to avoid spoilers) Ian then proceeds to whack Veritas over the head that she left him over and over thru out the book even though it is explained why and if the roles were reveresed. He also becomes very manipulative and treats her like a second class person. What happened to the equality and zing in the first book? Its almost sickening as well how Vertias gets treated and how she lets herself get treated.<br /><br /> I feel bad saying it but I really struggled to read this book. I put it down numerous times while reading it and I still have not finished it.  I usually can finish her books in a few hours and get fully immersed into the story and characters. I have almost all of her other books which I loved. I was unpleasantly surprised and dismayed at this one.",2.0,0,2020
Mystery & Paranormal - Great combo,"Although this was a young adult book, which I usually do not read, the subject matter fascinates me. If you are familiar with the works of Dr. Robert Schoch, Dr. Thomas Brophy, John Anthony West, and Robert Bauval, and their theories regarding the ancient Egyptian civilization, this book will appeal to you. The author incorporates some of the ideas presented by these men in this very well-written story. I am a stickler for a smooth read without grammatical interruptions. This author only had a few minor errors. Obviously he has a pretty good editor.<br /><br />I felt that his main characters Malia and Jaden were very similar characters to Tony and Tia from the movie ""Escape to Witch Mountain."" It was a favorite movie of mine.<br /><br />I would read more books by this author.",4.0,1,2020
Not as good as earlier books in the series,"I'm sorry to say I didn't enjoy this book (or the previous one) as much as all the others.

His personality doesn't come through very much and indeed, he seems to be mostly a source of worry and inconvenience rather than a positive addition to the characters' lives. However, the mystery was reasonably clever, I'm still invested in the characters, and hope for a return to cozy greatness in the next book.",3.0,0,2020
"Charming, behind the walls, must read for any British royal fan","Having heard of this book on several occasions, I finally decided to grab it (Kindle version) and have a read. Written by one of the nannies to Queen Elizabeth II, at the time, Princess Elizabeth, one is taken behind the palace gates and walls beginning in another time, under King George, the current Queen’s grandfather. Her parents were second, and highly unlikely to become anything more than second tier royals. Their young family was typical (for upper crust) and the young princess and her sister were destined for far simpler lives.<br /><br />You’ll follow the story of how Marian “Crawfie” Crawford joined their household and ended up taking a ride throughout history. And arguably, helping shape and from the future monarch for her important role in world history. Little did that young girl know what lie ahead...<br /><br />From her perspective you’ll be there through the princesses’ early years, life at 145 Piccadilly, the death of King George, the abdication of King Edward, and the assertion of her father into the highest role in the land at the dawn of a very frightening and dangerous age. From staying (somewhat) safe at Windsor through the marriage of the young princess Elizabeth to Prince Phillip, Crawfie was right there and shares it all.<br /><br />This is a story told with love and admiration for “our family.” Crawfies’s insights are tender, caring, filled with love, and admiration for the family she so faithfully served. At times it’s overly saccharine, with an excess of blind faith and admiration. But it also shows how much this young woman felt about the family she served. And if she is to be believed, how much she was entrusted, respected, needed, and included with this family.<br /><br />Much to her detriment. It’s interesting to see and learn how much this young and aging woman gave to this family and while they needed her, how much they expected her to give up in duty to them. One could argue they themselves gave up so much to their nation, so in turn, expecting her to give up was an honor and duty. Personal opinion and interpretation with rule the outcome of your read.<br /><br />This story ends in the year or so following Queen Elizabeth’s marriage to Prince Phillip. At that time Crawfiew and her husband were still very much a respected part of the fold... but that would change. In contributing to an article and the eventual writing of this book would change this woman’s relationship with the royal family forever. It is said they never spoke to her again. So reading this book is not just about the history of this young and historic family, but a precursor to how life with the royals can work out. I’d suggest doing a little side research to understand.<br /><br />I recommend this book as a great insight. If you’re a fan of the royals and/or admire the Queen, this is a must-read. A place to learn about the foundations of a woman who has given her life to her nation.",5.0,1,2020
Great Rockstar Romance - Minus the Heroine Hijacking,"This SHOULD have been a full Five-Star book. It had everything I LOVE in an IR romance - an awesome dark-skinned heroine who loves herself, the sexy hero with a heart of gold who sees and celebrates all of her, ride or die best friends, secondary characters who are also fully fleshed out, and of course the HEA - but once again I'm let down HARD by the dratted heroine hijacking which just pisses me off. Especially in this case - too many Black women spend WAY too much time sacrificing their happiness in real life, and I honestly want to read a book in which they put themselves FIRST and allow others to fight for them.<br /><br />What really threw me off is Lyris was unapologetically big, dark and lovely. She truly LOVES herself and wasn't willing to sell herself short. She moved to Los Angeles (with her best friend Serena) to pursue her dream of making it in the music industry, despite her highly religious family's disapproval as well as the industry's shallow penchant of looks over true talent. Lyris was a fighter in the best sense of the word, and she wasn't happy playing second fiddle when she knew she had what it took to shine. Which was why when it came down to putting her happiness above the haters, she CAVED!!! I literally wanted to throw my Kindle against the wall.<br /><br />With that off my chest, this was still an engrossing read. I loved everything EXCEPT THE HEROINE HIJACKING. I loved Gage who saw the woman he wanted and was willing to do whatever it took to not just get into her panties, but to help her live her dreams. Unfortunately, he also folded when things got real and that was also a huge letdown. I expect my heroes to go to the mat for the heroine, even if she doesn't want him to. I also loved his sad backstory, being the bullied fat kid who stuttered. I liked how he didn't run away from his past, but used it to keep himself humble. Of course, my FAVORITE character was Brandi, Gage's badass Black lesbian bassist. I totally got a Me'schell N'degocello vibe from her. In fact, his entire band were a bunch of awesomeness. Oh and yes, Gage's Brazilian mom gave me feels. Loved that woman.<br /><br />Minus the heroine hijacking, I place author Twyla Turner in my high top five of favorite IR romance writers.",4.0,1,2020
Charming inside peak with a fascinating women,"I've long been interested in history and the British royal family, so when I came across this autobiography by the Queen's cousin and lady-in-waiting to the queen mother, I took a look. This book turned out to be a charming and interesting insight into a time gone by, and inside the upper crust family, and behind the scenes peak at not only the royals, but history told by a fascinating woman.<br /><br />In the style of a chat, you feel as though you should be sipping tea (or any beverage) while sitting in the drawing room and having a chat with a favorite aunt. As the first cousin of Queen Elizabeth, Margaret Rhodes was raised in a British family with very close ties to the royals. Her mother was the sister of the Queen's mother, Queen Elizabeth the queen mother. So throughout her life Ms. Rhodes knew a life very much like Downton Abbey. But her playmate was a future queen and her life was anything but ordinary - for a woman in particular. She's a delightful storyteller and the stories... I know full well the citizens of the UK like their outdoor lifestyles, but Ms. Rhodes takes them to extremes. Her adventures and journeys, both before and after her service as lady-in-waiting, took her to some of the earth's most interesting and remote locales during a time of little such travel experiences, and put her face-to-face with not only interesting people, but historic moments as they happened.<br /><br />She seems a charming lady with a passion for life, sport, her family, and nation. A front row seat to history and historic people, Ms. Rhodes stories include Britain's most famous Prime Minister(s), foreign dignitaries, and of course, her own family. Her love and loyalty for the queen mother is unwavering, as is her admiration of the Queen.<br /><br />If you enjoy history, are interested in the British royal family, are a fan of Downton Abbey, or want to read about the fascinating life of an interesting woman, this book is for you.",5.0,1,2020

It really makes it exciting.<br />This had a huge rollercoaster of emotions. I’m laughing, I’m close to crying, I’m biting my nails in suspense, laughing again and shaking my head, so much happiness then fear, shock, a few happy fist pumps in the air and more suspense.<br /><br />I can’t tell you how much I loved this books so much, I most likely will be re-reading it again very soon.

Another great Bruisers novel!,"I'm a Sarina Bowen fan, and I love her Brooklyn Series! Honestly, ever time a new one comes out, I think to myself that she can't possibly top the last one, and she always gives me a great book that leaves me happy, laughing, and amazed and how much I adore these characters.<br /><br />Bess is a hockey agent, and she's the sister of Dave Beringer, from Bountiful (in the True North series). She does not anticipate a reunion with Mark Tankiewick (Tank), the newest Bruiser, but she's not going to pass the chance to be with the man from her past that she just can't resist.<br /><br />One thing that you can always could on with a Sarina Bowen book is that you'll feel a deep connection to the main characters. Bess and Tank are so well-developed, with layers of emotion and growth that you don't always see from other writers in this genre. Her stories are not just about the lust, the physical relationship and instalove. Her stories are about multi-dimensional people, with feelings, with emotion, with longing and growth.

Just ok for me,"First off, Susan Stoker is a one click/preorder author for me.  I think I have purchased every book she has ever written and I've enjoyed most of them.  I've recommended MANY of them to friends.<br /><br />Potential spoilers ahead.<br /><br />So this book.  The first chapter had me hooked.  Action.  Suspense.  Hot military men.  But it started to go down hill rather quickly once we fast forwarded five years.  Skyler and Bull had ""instant chemistry"".  For me, it was more like no chemistry.  I just didn't care for them together.  There was nothing about Sky that made her an interesting character for me.  Then when they were on their first date and Bull went all ""We're amazing together and this is where I see this going and blah blah blah"" (Seriously, I ended up skimming most of that speech) and she's all ""ok this is weird but ok.""  I'm like no girl.  You tell him you want to go home and he can find someone else because he seems crazy.  Then when he tells her what he does on the side and she's all ""get out!"" I'm like where was that backbone on your first date?  Total overreaction on her part.<br /><br />There were also a few editing mistakes (the biggest one being Bull brings up hiring Sandra's dad and everyone is like ""yeah we could use him for these things"" and then he brings it up again a chapter or two later and it's like this is a new idea).<br /><br />All that being said, the first book of a series is always hard for me - I feel like the author is trying to just get that one out there so we can get to know the next group of characters and the next few books always seem SO much better.  So I've already preordered the next one...",3.0,0,2020
"Some characters, dialogue, and events not believable. Some parts juvenile.","The Deal (Arranged Book 1) is a partial story which has explicit sexual descriptions, and a cliff-hanger ending.  No spoiler with this review.<br /><br />The effective prologue introduces the fathers of the male and female protagonists, and one of the father's son, the three of whom have just agreed upon a business deal involving a merger. Later, at a party on her eighteenth birthday, pretty Victoria (Tori) Lindsay is introduced to handsome and wealthy Stefan Zoric, the son who is involved in his father’s business-KZ Modeling. Hoping for a birthday gift involving her college plans, Tori is shocked when her father instead reveals a life-changing situation as her surprise gift. Disconcertingly, she is the only person near her father's group unaware of the details of her surprise, her gift being something she views as not only unexpected, but also unwanted.<br /><br />With the exception of a phrase or two, parts of the opening chapters of this story have the effect of a clean story. This makes the move to the initial and then numerous sexually explicit phrases strange. Unfortunately, those scenes seem as if the fantasies of a 15-year-old boy, rather than naturally occurring events within the story.  There is little character development and little romance—just movement from the cleaner parts of the story to the erotic parts, which unfortunately constitutes, rather than contributes to, much of the rest of the story<br /><br />At times Tori’s behavior is childish and Stefan’s actions absurd.  Also, interactions between Tori and Stefan often present as contrived rather than natural, making the protagonists less believable as characters.  On occasion the writing seems juvenile, as if this story had been written by a younger person, or for younger readers, which causes the erotic parts to seem outlandish rather than normal parts of the story. Some of the text is strange, “pressed a glass of champagne into my underage hand” (Why even use that word, and regardless, is her hand underage?). Some parts of the story should have resulted in significant angst, but didn’t. Also, the surprise at the cliffhanger ending was a surprise for Tori, but not to other main characters, or to the reader. This story could be improved with the addition of better character development, improved dialogue, and a little more intricacy with regards to events.<br /><br />The author could benefit from use of a thesaurus. As is common with authors writing today, she uses the word “smirk” too frequently, making it jarring, rather than effective. This author used “smirk” at least 7 times within approximately the first half of the story. In the 1980’s and 1990’s authors often used the word “enigmatic” when describing the male protagonist, although tending to use that word once or twice in the entire book. The word-of-the-day now seems to be “smirk” (or “smirking”). Occasionally authors carelessly sprinkle it throughout their stories, sometimes multiple times on the same page.  Overusing a vocabulary word not only nullifies the effectiveness of the word, but also becomes jarring to the text, thus distancing the reader (from the story), and detracting from the quality of the story.<br /><br />This story has potential, but as it needs improvement to enable it to move from mediocrity to better than average, I rated it deserving of 3 stars.",3.0,0,2020
"Wishy-washy protagonists with spoiled, snotty, rich, entitled, self absorbed characters","Juvenile writing at best. I wanted to give this book a chance as it was my First Reads choice after having only one 5-star rating at the time. What a mistake. I found myself reading on and on and rolling my eyes and literally face palmed myself a few times while laughing in disbelief. The two primary girls of this story are so wishy-washy. Should I do this? Yes! No! Oh, but wait, what should I do? Over and over and over for just about everything. So much angst and over the top drama for such ridiculously little things. I know this is a book written for a young audience, but it was too amateurish, slow and repetitive. I don't believe any of the characters except for Dylan were likable. How the dramatic portion of the book was written felt like a rushed afterthought.<br /><br />Personally, I do not care for the alternating chapters going back and forth between characters and timelines. It is distracting and takes away from the flow of the story.",1.0,0,2020
The main character is just unbelievably dumb.,"I have rarely had such a visceral reaction to a main character.  I did not merely dislike the main character here.  I despised him.  I loathed him.  I wanted him dead.  Largely because in my mind he died at least 4 times before I had gotten 35% through this completely unreadable travesty of a story.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with this book, and at the same time there is just one.  This book openly calls itself a ""harem"" book, and the anime/manga influences come out constantly.  But the writer is clearly not Japanese, and doesn't understand the culture that made anime harem comedies palatable.  Instead, there is a huge western spin on the idea, which always dumbs the main character down.  However, in Harem Planet, if we consider your average person a 5 when it comes to common sense/ability to focus, and a suicidal lemming is at a 1, the main character here is at negative infinity for that rating.<br /><br />Yes, this is a main character who in the middle of the battle while talking to 4 women who are not from Earth makes pop culture references that have nothing to do with the fight.  He also asks questions that aren't about saving everyone's life, but just because it adds to the page count as once he asks ""Who are the X?"" (X being an alien race that was named as makers of some weapon.)  We get pages of talk about the alien race, its habits, what it makes, etc.  Its bad enough that Baron Sord has the insight to have one of his own characters repeatedly complain about the lack of focus.<br /><br />But then we get the next anime trope overplayed and that is the enemy who has better equipment, more power, special abilities, etc.  Here it got to the point it wasn't interesting.  The 4 harem babes (they really don't get any development due to the kinetic nature of the writing), say that their ship is faster than any of the mercenaries who can somehow track a cloaked ship.  But they get run down by a mercenary rather easily.  Their cloaking device is ignored as they get hit by missile after missile.  They are out of defensive items.  Its like the ship is a death trap rather than one of the more powerful ships around.  It results in 20% of the story being a running smackdown with the MC and his girls on the receiving end, except for the pages where the MC is bringing up Klingons and Tom Servo when he should be concentrating on STAYING ALIVE!<br /><br />So the characters are terrible, especially the MC.  But the plot isn't better.  The 4 harem babes needed a new king and the king gets a ring that makes the wearer powerful.  So the mercenaries are after them.  They trick the MC into trying it on, get lucky that he figures it out before mercenaries who have been following the babes kill him, and then have a LONG talk to convince him to join them.  (which interestingly enough no mercenaries attack them during the talk.)  Once he joins, the MC insists on flying close to the moon so he can ""see"" the sun rise as they orbit.  [the ship has no windows, you'd think the computer would CGI the viewscreens so they could perhaps RUN AWAY!, but of course, they visit the moon, the mercs find them, the chase starts, etc.]<br /><br />In the end I couldn't take a plot that has NO character development at all, has a plot that runs as if the writer decided ""I'm going to turn it up to 11"" for the entire time with no breaks to reset scenes and characters, and just in general relies on tropes and abjectly stupid decisions by characters rather than a sensible and slow development.  I'm trying to picture how this would look if drawn in a manga or filmed as an anime, and I just can't picture any series that would have so much action and so little of everything else that makes a show watchable.<br /><br />But that goes back to my original thought about this.  Its written by someone who loves harem anime, but who is not from the culture that developed the genre and doesn't understand why it works or how the characters should be developed.<br /><br />This is a book I'd only talk about to tell other writers to look at for what not to do when writing.  Its that bad.  I'd give zero stars if I could because I just don't feel like any real effort went into the story.",1.0,0,2020
Absolutely Amazing!,"I’ve been in a reading slump due to some personal issues going on in my life. I’ve been struggling with finding something to hold my attention. Let me tell you, Up in the Treehouse by K.K. Allen broke my slump. I’ve been attached to this book for the last 48 hours. I’ve been immersed with this world and I’ve been in love.<br /><br />I am absolutely in love with Gavin and Chloe’s story. The amount of connection and raw feeling written is awe inspiring. I love the whole concept of the story and the delivery was spot on. The slow burn and angst between these two characters is uncharted. The amount of angst is palpable. The slow burn is real. The sexual tension between these two characters could burn the pages. The slow burn and back and forth of these characters is amazing. This whole book is worth the wait – the writing is fantastic and is hard to put down. I just needed to know what happened between these two. Their ordeal is hard to overcome but it’s so amazing to read their journey. The little nuggets of wisdom that K.K. Allen sprinkles throughout are swoon-worthy and memorable. Her words are amazing!<br /><br />I’m in love with this book and this writing style. I’m completely enthralled with this writing style. I’ll be looking for K.K.

Don't Waste Your Money,"Magnolia and Moses are reunited after 15 years apart. The madam wants nothing to do with the kingpin but someone is out to kill her and they have to work together to save her.<br /><br />This two part series was dry and repetitive. I enjoyed the first 3 books involving Keira and Mount. I enjoyed Mags in their story but on her own, nope. This couple had lackluster chemistry. Even their history of a two week love affair makes no sense. How do you ""wait"" 15 years for someone you spent 2 weeks with.<br /><br />Spoilers..... Moses rescues her from rape and they have amazing sex? In what world?! Then he returns randomly and she pushes him away only a couple days before falling back in love? With what? He's a ""kingpin"" with a two man crew and noone else to help him protect Mags? He's a wizard at making people disappear but he can't find the one man keeping him from being with the love of his life for 15 years? The brothel has such high security the kingpin can't get in but the killer can? Mount is the king of Louisiana but his daughter is kidnapped without tripping a alarm? Why can't Mags ask for Mount's help immediately after she's stabbed when she's under his protection?<br /><br />There's too much wasted back story and random characters who do nothing for the story. The sex is boring and the dialogue is horrible. Moses and Magnolia spent more time being eye candy than having a believable story. Pages wasted on the same words over and over. The angst was a joke and the big reveal was corny. Stop making series and just make one good book.",1.0,0,2020
The 411 on Histamine Intolerance,"While cruising through this book not only did it shed light on an unknown health issue but also it answered the majority of questions that would cross a person’s mind when they hear the words “Histamine Intolerance.”<br />Prior to reading this book, I felt as though I was a “special case” or a “weird person” for having all these intolerance to foods.<br />But after thoroughly dissecting each section of the book, I felt so relieved to know that having gone through certain symptoms and reactions when I eat food that I wasn’t alone.<br />I found the supplement section of this book to be very intriguing giving the fact there are availabilities one can take to adhere to their medical issue.<br />What I did happen to learn and this was also stated in the book numerous of times was that regardless of there being a chart of low to high tolerant foods everyone’s body processes it differently; therefore, I know to not take the chart so literally. That I myself have to test out and navigate myself while consuming anything.<br />Something that really caught me by surprise was that one way a person can detect or track their histamine tolerance is by monitoring their heart rate.<br />Never had I ever imagined that the heart itself can play a role but then again all the organs of the body function together.<br />I appreciated that some suggestions were given on what “equipment” would be good to monitor heart rates.<br />Overall, with each and every reading I’m learning something new everyday about histamine Intolerance.",4.0,1,2020
Don't Let it Be Over!,"Oh, please, don't let this be the last ""Under Suspicion"" story.  The writing duo of Mary Higgins Clark and Alafair Burke has hit another home run with ""Piece of My Heart."" Regrettably, the great MHC passed away earlier this year.  I hope Alafair Burke has secured any legal arrangements necessary with Simon and Schuster and the Clark family to continue this series.

Laurie's father Leo, a retired NYPD detective and main caretaker of her young son Timmy, immediately suspects a kidnapping has been ordered by a prisoner who is trying to get his case dismissed on the grounds that Leo fabricated the criminal's confession 18 years ago. The incarcerated villain angles to get his story told on Laurie's show about old murder cases, perhaps as leverage to reveal the whereabouts of the missing boy.

Repetitive and Littered with Spelling and Grammar Mistakes!!,"Preface to say: I am NOT a fan of the Harkles. I dislike Meghan a LOT and am disappointed in Harry and how he's willingly turned his back on his country and his family for her. I needed to say this to explain that my critique of this book has nothing to do with her opinions of this couple. I agree with a lot of what she said. Now, on to the review...<br /><br />I can't believe I spent almost $15 for this book. It was so hastily written that every few pages there are spelling and grammar mistakes. Near the end of the book whole paragraphs are repeated word-for-word a couple of pages later!! Had a college student turned this in for a grade their writing professor would have failed them just based on that alone.<br /><br />Another reason I disliked this book is because she repeated herself a lot. The same ideas were reworded throughout the entire book from beginning to end. It became redundant and annoying. The final reason I disliked this book so much was all the lecturing; even though I agreed with 85% of it, we could have done without. I felt like she was writing this book FOR Meghan and Harry and not for an audience looking to get information on what's really going on behind the scenes with the RF and that couple.<br /><br />Honestly, for a book that wasn't free, this was horribly written and a huge disappointment. I've read books by amateur authors who self-published that were well edited and didn't contain a single mistake so it's upsetting to me that a seasoned author signed with a publisher could allow what looks to be a DRAFT not a final product be sold to people as it is. Either her proof-reader and/or editor is bad at their jobs or she didn't allow her book to be edited and proof-read. No matter the excuse, it's insulting that people are paying money for this.<br /><br />TL;DR summary: if you don't mind tons of grammar and spelling mistakes, you don't mind the author repeating herself over again, you don't mind formatting mistakes such as the same paragraphs showing up a couple of pages later, and you don't mind being lectured to as if you're Meghan or Harry; then go right ahead and spend your money on this book. Otherwise, save your money for a book from someone else that is written a lot better.",1.0,0,2020
Best Music Theroy Book I have - Worth its weight in Gold,"Best Music theroy book I have seen. It explains things in an easy to understand format. No fluff. Everything is explained in a logical maner without expecting you to know anything yet not insulting your intellegence.  The knowlege can be applied to any musical instrument, but seems primarily targerted toward guitar and then piano. It is concise without being terse or leaving out important details. I was able to understand more reading this book for 3 hours than I have with other theroy books.

"Improbable, but suspensful. Has grammatical errors and other content errors","This book, the first of a series, requires reading multiple books to reach the story’s end.  It is noted to have been previously published as “the House of York”. The book includes violence and a limited amount of explicit sexual activity. No spoiler with this review.<br /><br />The female protagonist Everly, and a man named Jamie whom she had recently met, attend an exclusive event at an expensive hotel. After exiting the hotel, Everly becomes dizzy, blacks out, and awakens to find herself captive in an unknown place. Later she is given one brief warning to comply if she wants to survive. This is when the meat of the story begins.<br /><br />The overall plot is highly improbable, but the greater issues include grammatical errors such as the author’s seeming inability to construct a paragraph, her errors of usage of tense, and other significant content errors. If the author purposefully uses those multitude of single sentences for effect, then she certainly should not use rows and rows of them throughout the book. The author did use a proofreading service.<br /><br />The book has confusing segments due to the author having incorrectly used past tense when she should have used past perfect tense, clearly demonstrating difficulties with grammar. Twice I had to read a section several times to try to decipher what she had intended to impart. Additionally, this author used forms of the word “coy” at odd instances in reference to a man’s behavior. The word “coy” most frequently refers to a woman being cute, coquettish, attempting to be alluring or secretive in a provocative way to increase someone’s interest. Yes, it can be used to refer to a man being secretive, but to use it twice in this one book while referring to a man’s behavior is jarring. Regarding content errors, the most significant two are the dungeon situation, and the author creating a scenario whereby the female protagonist becomes part of a scene that is clearly out of sequence, the scene having already occurred.<br /><br />Initially a character does note the dungeon’s wet floor and smell of wet dog, possibly implying that the area is hosed. However, that same character later specifies the only 3 things that break up the routine of each day, and none of them include a shower or hosing. Without showering or hosing within the dungeon, entering the area of the captive(s) would have been intolerable due to the odor, particularly regarding that of excrement. That’s a big discrepancy within the story.<br /><br />Another significant inconsistency is the scene that is repeated out of sequence, creating a disjointed aspect to the story which would be difficult for any reader to overlook. Does this author not read her book prior to its submission for publishing?<br /><br />There are smaller content discrepancies such as Everly, with a bachelor’s degree, noting that answering phones at a marriage therapist’s office is the only job she is qualified to do. Also, Everly takes a sip of her drink without indication of anyone having handed it to her after her order, much less having probably altered it first. There are quite a few little inconsistencies such as that one within the book.<br /><br />On the plus side, while not totally original (not that it has to be), and however improbable, the story does have the potential to capture the interest of a reader who likes mystery, suspense, and a dark theme with angst.  Additionally, at least within this first book, the author effectively includes violence and sexual descriptions within the story which enhance it, rather than overwhelm it.  I rate the story with 3 stars and the author execution of it with 2.5 stars.",3.0,0,2020
Clean Romance,"Rounding up from 3.5<br />I liked this book overall. It plods along at a sedate pace but keeps moving along. There is romance and we even get more than one happily ever after. There is the catty ton, some angst, insults and compliments, more than one villain, multiple suitors, and this romance has a bit of intrigue in a spy subplot. I read other reviews that regretted there wasn't more depth to the intrigue or didn't care for it at all but I believe the author added it to give Stratford extra reasons to visit Eleanor at the Ingrams. The book is first and foremost a romance with just a bit of intrigue.<br />I liked the main characters and the secondary characters as well. I loved that they were loyal even under difficult circumstances. I also liked that we eventually found out why Eleanor had been a ward and received an inheritance. Took a while to get to the bottom of that one. And then it made perfect sense. I had speculated some but my thoughts were totally off.<br /><br />Sex: no<br />Language: no<br />Violence: yes",4.0,1,2020

Very entertaining fantasy read,"“Some truths do nothing but destroy and decay what they do not obliterate. Truths do not always set one free. Only a fool who has spent their entire life being fed lies believes that.”<br /><br />~REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS~<br /><br />I am not sure even where to begin with this review. This was my first Armentrout book and I went into it knowing that many of my fellow reviewers enjoy her work and nothing about her writing style. Thats about it. When this book was released in late March 2020 I stumbled across it while idly browsing Kindle titles and I had no idea it was surprise release, I just bought it because it sounded fairly interesting.<br /><br />When I started reading I must admit that I was fairly confused about some aspects of the story. Sure, there were many common fantasy elements that we’ve come to know and (mostly) love but nearly every page a group called the Ascended were mentioned. Now, I don’t know about you but when something is brought up so often I like to know what it is talking out. However, the Ascended are this kind of enigma. You are told that only certain people can go from being hum-drum boring old humans to becoming Ascended and that those people are then gifted an unnaturally long life. But…thats about it. It wasn’t until toward the end of the book that the reader is truly clued in to what these Ascended beings are. The reveal is not unexpected but still exciting.<br /><br />And, oh, the way Armentrout wrote that warmed my very soul.<br /><br />While I as the reader was kept in the dark regarding these beings, we find out that our first person narrator, Poppy, is also in the dark about them. Poppy has lead a very sheltered and controlled life. She gets to make no decisions on her own, is not permitted by the ruling class to speak to pretty much anyone, and is allowed no joys and frivolities in any way. She has trouble following those rules. Poppy is conditioned to believe everything that she is told and she is told that the Ascended are magnificent beings chosen by their god and…thats it. When we get the big reveal of what they truly are Poppy is shook and while with some context clues and dropped hints the reader can glean some assumptions about them it is still pretty thrilling.<br /><br />I do want to bring up here that there are TRIGGER WARNINGS in this book for repeated physical, mental, and emotional abuse. These abuses are used to control and condition Poppy and to shape her into the person the ruling class wants her to be. There is also off-screen violence against children, openly discussed proposed sexual abuse, and repeated violence.<br /><br />One of the biggest plot threads in this book is for the romantic/love interest for Poppy. Hawke, you could say, wears a coat of many colors. His main job is to be a guard for Poppy and he takes that position seriously. He is also her first sexual interest and Hawke makes no qualms about his enjoyment of that. Over the course of the story he is also a big part of the plot twist in the second half which I saw coming but was still a joy to read. I’m still on a fence about whether or not I like Hawke but, honestly, I feel like that is part of the point.<br /><br />Overall, this book had a lot of tropes that are common in fantasy novels but the story was so engrossing I couldn’t have cared less about them. Thats the thing about tropes, when used well they can enrich a story and Armentrout used them to their best advantage.<br /><br />For my first Armentrout book I was very pleased. The story kept my attention, was easy to follow along with, had enough twists to keep me on my toes, and was just fun to read. At the end of the day that is what is most important to me. Was the book fun and entertaining? Yes. I could go on and on about plot points, character development, and sexual tension for pages but the long and short of it was that the book was entertaining. I am very much looking forward to reading more of Armentrout’s work.",4.0,1,2020

A big slice of a life-changing calling!,"Three years ago (or thereabouts), I stepped onto the scale at my doctor’s office, dreading the number that would pop up on the digital screen. It won’t be so bad, I told myself. This whole weight gain is not a big—<br /><br />And then the number pops up: 244. My jaw dropped. I was 244 pounds. I am only 4'11 in height, and I weighed 244 pounds. It was official: I was obese. I had avoided full-length mirrors, ignored the fact that my bras were on too tight and I was spilling out everywhere. I even pretended not to notice that my pliable crew neck tops weren’t so pliable anymore, and that I could no longer fit into pants that didn’t have a stretchable waistband. And the fact that these pants had holes on the inner thigh area? Well, thigh-chafing is common, isn’t it?<br /><br />But I couldn’t escape the number on the scale. A scary number indeed. I had already begun my journey with God, and had resolved to lose weight, but looking at that number on the scale made it all too real for me, and I allowed God’s transformation to take me in full force.<br /><br />Joyce Meyer has always advocated a healthy lifestyle. She often talks about it in her sermons, so I’m not surprised that she wrote books about it. Even though I love her books, I find most of them to be repetitive, and I often recommend THE BATTLEFIELD OF THE MIND, HEALING THE SOUL OF A WOMAN, LIVING COURAGEOUSLY, and CHANGE YOUR WORDS, CHANGE YOUR LIFE as her staples. Many of her Bible-teaching books and other efforts are great, and I recommend them, especially if they speak to you, but mostly they’re just variations or amplifications of the aforementioned books. I enjoyed LOOK GREAT, FEEL GREAT because she offers practical and compassionate solutions to your nutritional lifestyle. It’s not about losing weight — it’s about a complete lifestyle change. You’re not dieting to lose weight; you are changing your eating habits and exercise regimes, for life. This is for the long haul, something you’d have to do for the rest of your life, and yes, it requires discipline and a transformed mindset, and where better to go with this than to the Most High God?<br /><br />And that’s when it comes in for me. Before my healing journey with God, I yo-yo dieted on and off, with temporary results and zero exercise. I stress ate when things went wrong in my life, and my health suffered as a result. I had an Eating Disorder when I was only twelve years old, and it went downhill from there. Once God took over, I noticed a shift in my mindset, and my eating habits changed. They didn’t change overnight, and I’m glad they didn’t. This time I didn’t lose weight in a few months — it took me over two years. Then I took an interest in fitness. God had placed the desire to exercise in my heart a long time ago, but I hadn’t acted on it until this year, where I added toning, sculpting and cardio (which includes HIIT and ab workouts) into my daily routine, replacing flab with loads of lean muscle. Best. Decision. Ever. My body’s strong, my metabolism is faster, and I take pleasure in eating protein-rich food and lots and lots of fresh fruit. My current eating lifestyle brings joy into my life, something I had never thought possible. It hadn’t even crossed my mind.<br /><br />So I do recommend this book, especially to those getting a special calling from God that includes nutrition. If you feel that little nudging in your soul, that’s God calling out to you, saying, “Yo, move it!” Only nicer! :) You won’t have to fear the number on your scale anymore. I sure don’t! I’ve lost about 110 pounds! I have a thigh gap, for crying out loud! I went from thigh-chafing to a thigh gap. God is great indeed. Just five more pounds to go and I’m all set. I plan on seeing a nutritionist to help craft a lifetime weight maintenance plan. Four out of five Low-Fat Oatmilk lattes, with a dash of low-sugar hazelnut flavor.",4.0,1,2020

No mythology needs trigger warning,First off this is in no way based on Norse mythology AT ALL. It's more of a weird Marvel rip off at best. Second there needs to be a huge trigger warning. It has multiple non-con and serious Stockholm Syndrome.<br />I'm only halfway through the book and felt the need to warn furure readers of the misleading description.<br /><br />The story itself is okay but written in a not okay way. I flat out bought the book and I'm regretting that choice now. If you have KU read through that first.,2.0,0,2020
It's David Copperfield by Charles Dickens.,"This book is a classic of such stature that I don't think anybody would really care about my opinion of it as literature.  I enjoyed reading it as an eBook because I could look up archaic words and phrases immediately.  I thought I read it as a child but as I went along, I didn't really remember that much about it. So I wonder now if I really made it through it back then.  I am now just turned 70 so I was able to understand it much better than I would have as a ten year old girl.  It is long and plodding, I think, to modern tastes.  David is such an amazingly well behaved and articulate child that I found it not quite credible.  Still, the story is well worth the slog.  If I understand correctly, his focus on poor working folks as well as middle class ones was quite revolutionary.  The whole Peggotty  family are so warm and real that you can't help but love them.  I'm glad I got to know them.  Steerforth is not as wonderful, but still worth getting to know.  So, if you've got the time, I recommend picking it up and giving it a try.",5.0,1,2020
Had a lucid dream the same week I read this,"Since I was about 13 years old, I've had a lucid dream here and there. Most have been simply observing what was happening in the dream, while being fully aware that I was in a dream. After having my fourth-remembered lucid dream, I decided to purchase this book.<br /><br />Within a week of reading the first few chapters, I started to lucid dream more frequently. I think I ended up getting up to six lucid dreams in the first month I read it. These dreams were the first where I was actually able to control what was happening. Here's what happened in one:<br /><br />I was standing in a white bedroom with just a single bed, instinctively knowing that this was my bedroom. All of the sudden it started snowing inside. I remember thinking that I need to talk to the landlord about filling the cracks near the windows, but then I realized it didn't make sense that it was full-blown snowing from the ceiling. BOOM! I became lucid. Overcome with excitement, I tried to make something manifest. Looking at one of the bedroom walls I thought to myself, ""MELT."" Within seconds, the wall started to look like the dripping wax of a lit taper candle.<br />Still amazed with the concept of controlling my lucidity, I ran into the living room of the dream. I kept thinking that I wanted to see some sort of mythical creature, so I first thought of a fairy. Closing my eyes I tried to manifest it, then I hear *tink tink* on the window of the living room. Sure enough a three-inch pixie was starting at me through the window.<br /><br />Long-story-short, this is a great tool to unlock the ability to become aware in your dreams.",5.0,1,2020

Great start to a promising new series!,"I have read and enjoyed several books by each of these authors.  As a team, the output is terrific!  The characters are deeply developed, the scenes are vividly described and the story is well-written.  Widespread natural disasters occurring at an increasing rate are predicted to tear the world apart.  A strange variety of people suddenly go missing, but almost everyone else is concerned with seeking possible safe havens.  Special Agent Kendra Baker decides to keep investigating the disappearances.  Ex-Marine Corporal Andrew Miller refuses to accept it when his daughter goes missing; he enlists the aid of a computer hacker on the trail of a strange acting billionaire.  Their paths cross, but Kendra pegs Andrew as one of the kidnappers, so they aren’t working together.  Will they be able to pool their resources to find the missing people?  The plot twists and the building suspense of the disasters keeps the reader riveted to the story, turning pages, losing sleep, to get to the surprising end of this portion of the series.  I received an ARC – this review is my honest opinion.  I liked it so well that I bought a copy to support these deserving authors.  I’m eagerly awaiting the next book.",5.0,1,2020
"Not for me, but others will enjoy it","This book wasn't what I was hoping it would be. From the blurb, I knew Christian was socially awkward--and he was--but I wasn't expecting Riley to treat him like a child with special needs rather than a man who was intellectually gifted. I hated how she made excuses for him, ""That's just Christian,"" and how she tried to fit him into this little box that he was never meant to be in. On the surface, she was openly accepting of him and in the next breath, she's slamming the door in his face (figuratively) because he said or did something that was too intense for her. I don't know where she was coming from because he did nothing wrong. Not one thing. He was being Christian because he didn't know how else to be. She made him feel like he was okay and then suddenly he wasn't. Not anymore.<br /><br />Riley. Oh man, for being a teacher of a gifted class, she sure was dumb. I didn't like her at all. I thought she was superficial and petty. Her hang up with him buying things for her and spending more money on the relationship than she was just flat irritated me. I didn't like her diatribe on testing in the schools, since it had zero to do with the story. I didn't particularly enjoy her stereotyping of Southern belles, since that didn't push the plot any further, either. And the way she flipped on him made me want to shake her. Suffice it to say, she'd be doing a whole lot of groveling.<br /><br />The bottom line is both characters were one-dimensional and had the emotions of paper dolls. There aren't any real descriptions of either character, although we do know she is of Middle Eastern heritage and he is a swimmer with brown hair. We find out at 87% that he has moss green eyes. Other than that, nothing. I didn't care about either one of them, although I liked him far more than I liked her.<br /><br />As for romance, I love the genre. I read more romances than any other genre and yes, I do skip from genre to genre. This one failed me on every level. I love the tension that builds up between characters, going for that first kiss, the first time they do the be-bop, the first time they say I love you. In this book, we find out AFTER it's all over with. Christian kissed her, but we don't find that out until the next chapter. He spent the night at her house. Again, we find out in the next chapter. He told her he loved her. Next chapter, complete with her baseless theatrics. I'm sorry, but that doesn't work for me. I don't need a Rated R or bigger rating for that. I'm okay with a PG-13 or even a PG. But I want to be there when it happens. I don't want to see idiotic Riley languishing in the memory of it. It does nothing to pull at my heartstrings. Getting that pull is the biggest reason I read romances. I got none of that in this book. If it wasn't for the gratuitous cursing that doesn't even fit well in the story, this could be a YA romance.<br /><br />I don't mean to come down so hard on any book. I know how much hard work, blood, sweat, and tears go into writing a novel, but this wasn't really a romance to me. Maybe it could be Women's Fiction or something, but not romance.<br /><br />Many will enjoy it. I just didn't. I was ready to throw in the towel at 52%, but kept going, hoping something would change. It just didn't. Sadly. I had such high hopes for this book.<br /><br />Oh, and this cover. The one where the man is holding a ring case behind his back. Where did that come from? It's not like it happened in the book. Give me the cover with the guy with the messy hair and the glasses any day.",2.0,0,2020
Wokeness Simplified and Explained,"If you are like me, then you probably have been shaking your head from time to time over the past few months saying, ""What exactly is wokeness? And what is happening in our country?  Does it really matter?""  Wiley's book makes learning about wokeness not only fun, but educational.  After reading it, you will understand the seriousness of the threats facing our country.  ""Where is all of this rioting and cancel culture going?"" you might ask.  ""Why in the world would we ever pay anyone reparations?"" Wiley shows you where wokeness is going as he walks you through a simple fairy story.  ""Aren't fairies for little girls?"" you might ask.  Maybe.  But this fairy story is, in a way, its own Trojan horse brought to teach you about the terror and destruction happening in our country right now in the name of BLM and Antifa.  These days, unfortunately, it is anathema to have a conversation about racial issues.  But Wiley's book enables you to have that discussion in the form of a story.  Jesus, in his days, used to teach the people through parables.  Stories always have enabled us to learn lessons that we couldn't learn from a straight dialogue.  In a way, Wiley is using a parable to teach the nation about wokeness and its destructive wake, so that it is not destroyed.  Wiley has sounded the alarm. The Elven Inquisition will make you an informed citizen.  From there, it's up to you to do something to stop the direction of our country, for like the French Revolution, the wokeness is not headed in a good direction.  In the end, our is is the greatest nation the world has ever known.  To sit idly by while wokeness shoves its beliefs down our throats is simply unacceptable.  Read the Elven Iquisition (it only takes about three hours to read), and be amazed that a seemingly simply fairy story might be just what the country needs to wake it from its slumber before it is too late.",5.0,1,2020

"unapologetic fun, but still flawed","I find that the LitRPG Apocalypse genre is definitely a guilty offering.  I can't quite call it a pleasure because so many of these stories manage to completely ruin their own stories with a few quirks that appear again and again.<br /><br />Mind Games actually manages to avoid overdoing a few of the quirks and flaws.  I think part is because Marc tried to write about people he could actually picture in his mind.  Yes, they do some things that are going to squick some readers, but that's mostly hinted at, and not described.<br /><br />He does play up the ""only a few people get the MMORPG aspect of the new ""system"", which was a bit off to me.  Most people are a mix of panicky and curious.  I can't quite picture an entire town of several thousand people not having at least one person testing the system and discovering things like happens here.  Sure it helps the plot since the MC gets to talk to everyone and explain and gain cred with them, but......<br /><br />The other quirk that got played out (again) was the.  ""You get bonuses because you are in a wilderness that's going to be a high mana area"" one.  So the MC and several of his companions have bonus powers/classes and this makes their 10 mile hike back to town possible.<br /><br />But my complaints are little things overall.  The story is well written with enough action to be interesting and characters that might lose a battle of wits with your average rock, but still have enough depth to entertain.<br /><br />I'll admit that I'm looking forward to book 2 in this series.  It will be interesting to see how this story plays out compared to the others of the genre.  I don't think it rises to the level of the Shadow Sun series, but its a step up from some others I've read recently.",4.0,1,2020

..... well..... meh.,"I sort of liked this tale.  The idea is good.  The character is very anime/manga influenced and more than a little depressing because of that.  And angsty, god was he angsty about passing his classes at times.<br /><br />I think the angst is what leave me thinking ""meh"".  The internal monologues of doubt and despair (gloom, despair and agony on me!)  are not fun to read and quite frankly tend to ruin otherwise good tales.  And they tried to do that here.<br /><br />Its an interesting world, and the background work is solid, but I never dove in fully.

Worst ending to a great series EVER.,"Just like I feared. Series stories always seem to forget about their ""legend"" and instead of telling a good story through to the end they screw it all up. The style of this writing is so different from the other books it seems like someone else finished it. Chapters start way in the future with side characters telling the story, writing it down, or it being studied way in the future. It ruins the flow of the story because all of these unessesssary characters appear, you know who survives and who dies, there is WAY too much writing about the war movements and battles because it doesnt move the story along, too many characters to keep track of so they get killed off in meaningless ways. They dont even accomplish anything, their deaths mean nothing so why bring them in at all? The big reveal of who the emperor is....is just stupid.  Ciri is a wretched main character... I want to slap her more than anything, really dont care at all what happens to her at this point. It's one meaningless adventure full of crap decisions one after the other, the legend is just dumped (like in GoT) and everyone dies and Ciri goes to Camelot with Sir Galahad. Seriously. Who was high when he wrote this crap? One of the worst endings ever.",1.0,0,2020
Yessssss!!!!!,"Had no idea I was kinda over the gentle and slender typical shoujo heroes and really wanted to read about a muscled, in your face, pushy, over confident alpha. But here I am loving this manga waaaaaay too much 😂. Akari-Chan is kinda your ordinary girl next door. Nothing to write home about. She’s pretty and nice but not super popular and experienced with boys. Her bestie is Takuto-kun, who would usually be a lead love interest. Very refreshing that he’s not even in the running, but rather used as a comedic sidekick. He has a man crush on Abe-kun. Abe-kun is very abrasive and Akari can’t stand him. She prefers pretty boys not jocks. Not sure if Abe-kun’s been secretly crushing on Akari this whole time or just became interested in her after seeing her get flustered? Not a whole lot of backstory. But it’s typical shoujo. Very fast paced. Cute characters. Lovely art. A very possessive alpha and a heroine who does a bang up job embarrassing herself. Also great secondary characters that really add to this story. Can’t wait for volume two!!!!",5.0,1,2020

This Democrat Was Not Impressed With Book's Jumbled Narrative,"As a Democrat(ic) occasional Fox News watcher, I was looking forward to reading this expose.  However, I found the jumbled narrative disconcerting as it flitted from one subject to another; anecdotal material sometimes had no point.  Also, the author had a tendency to presume the reader had a certain knowledge base, which would enable him/her to understand the subject or personality being discussed.  Overall, I did not find this to be an informative or interesting read.  And for those who care about such things, the book's primary narrative ended at around 65%; the remaining 35% of the book was footnotes.",2.0,0,2020
Grade schoolers might like it but too old for them!,"Like other reviews stated, the language style in this book is quite immature. I've read those types of books before though so I soldiered on. Snow is an annoying character from the start because she fluctuates between acting snarky and bad ass to being a self-hating crybaby. She's super bipolar even before her ""change"". Story lines kind of trip over each other and make no sense as to why they're being discussed. I'm assuming the author was attempting to create mystery and suspense with some of the story lines, but the effort fell flat. I was already frustrated toward the end of the book because I was led to believe from the book blurb that Snow started going to a prestigious magic school. Nope. Just her magical neighbor's basement. And she doesn't really learn anything because she's too busy constantly trying to get some guy's attention. Even though she believes herself to be plain...makes no sense! And the ""cliffhanger""?! Forget about it. The whole premise is insane. I won't be reading further. I gave two stars because I feel this ""world"" has potential. Written differently, it would be a fantastic series.

It's just racism and sexism with a veneer of genetics,"I got this book from my library. With multiple grad degrees in anthropology and psych, I wondered if the author would be talking about the 'braided cord' view of the evolution of H. sapiens, H. neanderthalensis and the Denisovans.  Nope!  It's just the same old conclusion: race is biological! Sex differences in capability, etc. are real!<br /><br />Racist/sexists used to be crude, and some of them still are.  But the best ones these days wrap their white male power and control agenda in a ""gosh, we're sorry, but SCIENCE SAYS IT - not us. We're so reluctant to come to this conclusion but we can't help it. The data is clear.""<br /><br />Yes, the data is clear.  There is 10 times more genetic difference between my Ethiopian sister and the President of Zaire than there is between her and EuroAmerican me.  10 times as much.  And sure women have difference bodies - if you're trying to make a baby.  Otherwise, ....<br /><br />This is the same old trash, gussied up in new neuroscience babble and new genetic babble.  In the same way that some people are STILL trying to prove that IQ scores = intelligence (they measure how prepared you are for SCHOOL learning, not any other kind of smarts), this attack on equality-advocates is nothing new.<br /><br />Data taken out of context.  Preliminary results based on small samples used to predict millions of people's destinies.

Cute roommates to lovers,"Truth, I’m the worst owner of a English lit bachelors degree, I’ve avoided/disliked Austen from the beginning. Needless to say I have avoided all the retellings I come across too. But the cover on this one was super cute and the blurb enticing, so I gave it a go.<br />Things I liked:<br />I liked Cam, she’s easily my cup of tea. Anyone who loves nerd things and books and makes her whole life and living around need things and books, is my kind of girl. Plus, can I just say I want to work where she works. Seriously, sign me up. I hate that she’s so convinced she belongs on a certain shelf. It’s weird in a way because she’s actually really confident in who she is, but at the same time insecure about going outside of her shelf. It’s an interesting contradiction that totally makes sense given her backstory, but I wanted so much for her to have more faith in herself and her worth. Tyler is a really sweet stand up guy, he’s pretty patient with Cam, and is really an all around good friend before they act on anything. I think their chemistry is really good too. The angst in the book is good. The secondary characters are great, they really help make the story instead of being just filler.<br />Things I didn’t like:<br />Tyler is super patient and kind, but when it counts he wasn’t, which irked me because it didn’t feel authentic to him. But it did give way to the ending so it didn’t bother me that much. Also I felt like Tyler was interfering intentional with Cam’s matchmaking, maybe not maliciously but sometimes it felt like it didn’t come from a good place. Sure Cam reacted to it all really terribly, and she has to own those choices, I’m just not sure why Tyler felt the need to do that especially without even a heads up and then basically smirking his way through it until it blew up in her face. I mean it really irritated me. Like a lot. Those are really my only two complaints.<br />Pacing was great; heat was great; story was good; liked the angst; all around good read.",4.0,1,2020

"This book is what ""Number of the Beast"" was supposed to be ...","I'm no stranger to Robert Anson Heinlein.  I have everything Heinlein has ever written, all his published notes, his commentary, his letters, and every story both Juvenile and Adult.  Which I have not only read but listened to in audio format for hours and hours driving.  In my opinion Heinlein only wrote two stinkers and one of them was not Pursuit of the Pankera.  Even in those once you get past the worm the rest of the apple is pretty good.  (Hint: One of them is ""I Will Fear no Evil"", see if you can guess the other.  Go on, it'll be fun.)<br /><br />Let's get started ...<br /><br />First off, let's get something straight here.  Regarding the content of Pursuit of the Pankera -- Heinlein didn't ""look at what he had written and decide it was crap because it didn't hold true to the characters of the other universes like the Lensmen and Barsoom series"".  Then rewrite the whole shebang.  That's nonsense.  I'm a fan of ERB, E.E. Doc Smith and  L. Frank Baum as much as any of you.  Heinlein's purpose was NOT to ""remain true"" to the characters of those other authors, it was to write his OWN interpretations of those well known preceding authors of classic Science Fiction.<br /><br />That was the entire BASIS and the sole reason for the book's addressing ""parallel universes"".  So that Heinlein in the guise of ""alternate universes"" could use the characters of those authors interpreted and applied to his own means and for his own ends.  If you think otherwise then you just don't know your Heinlein because Bob was anything but stupid or prone to embarking on unproductive failures.  RAH was very conscious of his bottom line.  Thus he was quite well aware that he could not and should not try to extend the works of previous, enormously popular authors and their massively well-known characters.  He just wanted to ""borrow"" them for his own work and so the mechanism he chose was to create parallel universes that HIS originally created characters (Zeb, Deety, Jake, Hilda and their ""car"")  would experience.  This gave him the wiggle room he wanted to do whatever he felt like without the constraints of remaining strictly, exactly, precisely true to the originals.  By using alternate and parallel universes Heinlein could mold those other characters to the story he wanted to tell and he did so masterfully.<br /><br />Masterfully because every single one of us who knew what he was talking about in reference to Edgar Rice Burroughs, E.E. (Doc) Smith and L. Frank Baum's novels ""got"" what he was doing and recognized those other ""universes"".  It was like meeting old friends who had put on a new suit of clothes and the tag in those duds read ""Tailored by Robert A. Heinlein"".<br /><br />The problem and the reason why Pankera was not published earlier, say in 1973 or so, is not one of writing style, homage to other authors, lack of rigor to pre-existing characters or any of that sort of horse leavings.  The reason this wasn't published had nothing to do with frustration over style, or fears of treading on the toes of another author, or any sort of artistic stenosis.  The biggest reason was plain, old, garden variety, contemporary, temporal to the current United States of America, copyright infringement and fear of litigation arising therefrom.<br /><br />Because Barsoom, Oz, and the Lensmen's universe are all elements of stories copyrighted by other authors and other publishers.<br /><br />Nearly 50 years, a half a century, has passed since Bob Heinlein wrote this original version of ""The Number of the Beast"" and was forced by his editors and publishers to re-write it without the potential copyright infringements.  Clearly during this half century span and due to expiry, permissions and whatever other mechanisms could be brought to bear the Family and Estate of Robert Anson Heinlein has brought you, as best as possible, his original ""Number of the Beast"" and if you're a fan of Bob Heinlein's work you should be very, very grateful.<br /><br />As I am.<br /><br />Because this is a great work of Heinlein as it was meant to be before bean counters and lawyers made him write that mish-mashed hash that was originally published.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Zebbie, Deety, Jake, Hilda and Gay Deceiver in BOTH books.  I'm also a fan of Lazarus Long's stories.  But the original Number of the Beast just sort of sputtered out during the last few chapters and I've always wondered why the heck Heinlein gave such a great book such a weak ending.  Now we all know why.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the original Number of the Beast you should absolutely love Pursuit of the Pankera.  Because Pursuit of the Pankera is the undiluted original straight-up-without-ice version and without all the problems, inconsistencies and outright flops caused by the meddling of lesser men in Heinlein's original story line.<br /><br />Now we have Pursuit of the Pankera to add to Spider Robinson's creation of Variable Star from Bob's notes and these great works are now the property of eternal posterity.  In these posthumous works we have been very blessed and I know for as certain a certainty as is possible this side of the veil that Bob would approve.  I also know that he's laughing because some of you don't ""get it"".<br /><br />I just wish Pursuit of the Pankera were about eight or ten chapters longer.  When you get to the end you'll see what I mean.  The family and estate had to make due with what they had that was Real Robert Anson Heinlein and that's what they did but I wish ol' Bob would have written a few more chapters before closing this book.  Even so, if you read it carefully you'll see that it's not a cliffhanger and no character's fate was unaccounted for.<br /><br />Please feel free to comment, I'd love to discuss this book with both lovers and haters thereof while it's still fresh in my mind.",5.0,1,2020
"Short, High Level and Full of Typos","I'll first start on a positive note. The book did bring some things to my attention that I didn't know before reading. It's got /some/ interesting and technical content in it but does not explain very much in detail so you're left to read further on your own. That's about the only good thing about this book.<br /><br />The bad thing about this book is that it's very high level and seems like it was written in a rush. The information about setting up the Raspberry Pi is maybe useful to a very very new Raspberry Pi hobbyist but to anyone who's ever used one, you can skip the first third of the book. Second, the book is full of grammatical and typographical errors making some sections very difficult to read. You almost have to wonder if the author is not a native English speaker and, if they are not, they really should have had someone who was proof read this before publishing. Third, the information presented about AX.25 is sparse and missing entire categories of information that would be very interesting to someone just getting in to ham radio such as APRS and Winlink.<br /><br />Overall, I give this book a 2/5. If it didn't have so many errors, I'd have rated it higher as the information in the book could actually be useful to someone just starting out in the hobby but I can't, in good conscience recommend this book to anyone with any prior experience with either a raspberry pi or ham radio. Save your money and look up ""AX.25 node Raspberry Pi"", ""APRS Raspberry Pi"", ""Winlink Raspberry Pi"" and ""Zork AX.25 Raspberry Pi"" and you'll learn more than you can from this book.",2.0,0,2020
Absolutely love this next installment of Monsterly Yours!,"I was thrilled with The Troll's Bride's concept of pixies, so you could imagine how enthusiastic I was when I heard that Ms. Sanders's next publication would be The Pixie's Queen. Okay. How what she going to do this? How many TV/movies were based on someone getting shrunk? Not much in terms of romances, I recall. But when I saw the revealing of the front cover for The Pixie's Queen, I was enthralled. Totally. I KNEW this would be a very loving, heart-warming book.<br /><br />Orenda was born into a witch family but without witch powers, more's the pity. So while she was exploring a mystical-feeling antique store where she comes across a medallion that reacts to a magical talisman her grandmother bequeaths her. So what happens? The talisman/medallion activated a portal, sucked her away into another plane of existence (our Troll universe!), and shrunk her! Now what?<br /><br />We meet a quad of hive brothers named Shavish (the alpha of the group), Dazi (the scholar), Gwin (who HATES the big, two-leggeders), and Orel (a real sweetheart who guards unmated pixie queens). They have pretty much given up hoping to attract a queen (well, all except for Shavish who is CONVINCED this year would be their year). Their next move would be to have their hive disbanded and then they would be magically castrated so that they would no longer produce or be affected by pheromones. Thus, they'd become glorified pixie eunuchs. UGH! But when the four agree to participate in the absolute last mating flight, Dazi finds/rescues Orenda who becomes high on the four's collective pheromones and pixie dust (which is PIXIE SE--oops! I'll let you find that out by yourselves!), she leaps into a five-some orgy... and discovers that this isn't pixies-with-benefits but until-death-do-us-part!!<br /><br />Wahh!!!! Orenda wants to return to her Earth! She wants to be a BIG girl once again! She wants to return to her job as a custom fashion designer. She doesn't want to be shackled to four teeny pixie males! Yet if she does, she will condemn at least one of her pixie mates to death, if not a few others! If only she knew...<br /><br />The rest of the novel is all about her trying to figure out what to do with this dilemma on her hands.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the world-building in this story. I have an extensive knowledge base of pixies as well as their fae brethren, and I loved what SJ Sanders did in this tale, further elaborating on what we had already known in The Troll's Bride. It was definitely worth the wait!<br /><br />The four pixie males were fantastic! It's so hard to write a decent reversed harem story because it takes a lot of exposition as well as significant character development required. However, I was able to fully understand each individual. All four had their own quirky personalities which were easily followed. I enjoyed how Ms. Sanders wove each character in and out of Orenda's own, creating a true hive with its reigning queen. There were great moments of intimacy which made me feel so warm and fuzzy. Yes, there were times that Orenda was rather whiny, but her character did understand that in the meantime, she had to do something with herself while the four (mostly Dazi) sought to figure out how to return her to her usual stature if that is what it took to make her happy.<br /><br />SJ Sanders didn't let me down with The Pixie's Queen (except, it should had been titled ""The Pixies' Queen"" to be grammatically correct! Sorry! But that's the ol' editor speaking!!), but never mind. I loved this book, and I'll be rereading it again and again and again! It is definitely worth the purchase of the entire series! If not, just get this one book for its front cover! It's magnificent!!",5.0,1,2020
Title Suggestion,"John Jakes’ books were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s.  In my 20s, I tried reading the first book in the North and South series and just couldn’t get into it.  Further, while character development and historical detail were good, I found the plot and pacing left much to be desired.<br /><br />Guess what?  Now in my 60s, I find that The Bastard, the first book in the Kent Family Chronicles is much the same.  In fact, I think the title should be changed to A Story About a Boy Who Can’t Catch a Break or Make Up His Mind Told Very Slowly.”  Fortunately, the last 5 chapters or so finally add exciting pacing and edge-of-your-seat tension as the first spark of the American Revolution is lit.  Up to that point however, for the reader, it’s a forced march thru deep mud to get there.",3.0,0,2020
3.5 stars - Cute book for all kids who like wheels,"I thought this was a great picture book for all kids who like wheels.  I liked that there are both feminine and masculine cars.  I have girls who love truck stories too, and I think that this is a great book for all kids in that 3-7 range.<br /><br />Why 3.5 stars?  I read this through twice and the rhyming was a little awkward for me and awkward as a read aloud.

"Nothing new, and not inspiring","I had high hopes for this book after reading the blurb, the reviews, and the ""look inside.""<br /><br />Unfortunately, the more I read in this book, the more I felt like I'd read the same thing in others' books... and they were better.<br /><br />Maybe this book improved after page 30 or so, but - by then - I felt like reading it was a waste of time.<br /><br />Sure, I knew this guy's book covers looked almost identical to at least one other author's books, including Russell Bruson's. Same font. Same styling. ""Copy what works,"" right...?<br /><br />And the title was a close match for one of Robert Kiyosaki's books. (Again: copy what works, I guess.)<br /><br />Well, I wanted more original, interesting content than this delivered.<br /><br />If you're entirely new to this niche, you may be delighted with this book.

A wonderful story!,"I am not sure what I was expecting from this book. I just finished binge reading a cozy mystery series from this author and thought I would try reading some of her other works while awaiting the release of the next book in that series. I am so glad that I did! This story really pulled at my heartstrings. That is the only spoiler I will give away. It was an entertaining and easy read. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys spending an evening reading a good mystery story. There is only one drawback, the second book in this series won’t be released for another three days!

The hero cheats,Not a fan of a book that has gratuitous cheating by the hero. Suddenly 3/4 of the way through the book the hero has becomes a different person who has know control over his “itches” and despite his “love” for the heroine he starts having thresomes with strippers. It was complexity gratuitous and didn’t fit the story. He admitted himself that he was cheating.  He isn’t a hero at that point.

ANOTHER WONDERFUL READ BY ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS,"Alba, who is the eldest daughter of Francesco (married to Anna) from The Tuscan Secret, has come home to Tuscany brokenhearted and guilty after the death of her fiance.  While hiking the trails near her home, she found a box of silverware which began her search for the story of the pieces.  During her search, she came upon the ruins of a house in the mountains and met an endearing elderly man, Massimo, who shared his story of being part of the resistance against the Nazis during WWII in Italy.  As Angela Petch has done in her other novels, the action moves back and forth between the present day and the past which is a very effective vehicle for an historical novel.<br /><br />I identified with the characters who were very well developed and enjoyed seeing how Alba had grown and changed from the first time readers were introduced to her in The Tuscan Secret.  I highly recommend all of Angela Petch's books about Tuscany and, even though this one is based on characters from The Tuscan Secret, it is a fine stand alone novel.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more books by this author who is obviously and understandably in love with and fascinated by Tuscany and the Apennines.",5.0,1,2020
What happened?,"I’ve been a Picoult fan for a long time, but this book had too many problems to be enjoyable. First, I enjoy a book that gives you info on a particular subject—this novel gave me info on too many subjects. Starting with Egyptology, moving onto physics, while threading ‘death Douala’ throughout. Talk about bogging down a story with too many facts.<br />My second problem, was the character came off as a selfish, spoiled woman who blamed others for her problems while appearing to be above the ‘worries’ of the world. Of course two amazing men love her unconditionally—like that happens in real life—and she can’t seem to make up her mind which one she wants to be with.<br />——-spoiler alert——-<br />My third, and most important reason for being disappointed in one of my favorite authors, is the ending. I won’t give it away, because the author certainly didn’t. I feel like I waded through an Egyptian textbook only to not be given a pay off in the end.<br />I would advise Picoult to find herself another group of ‘early-readers’, people who aren’t in awe of her so she can know when she’s being too much of a writer, and not enough of a storyteller.",2.0,0,2020

"I love the idea, but in the end this felt like a miss","Man sent with small task force to explore space as captain of one of the ships.  Fleet wiped out, but he wakes up as a spirit able to change the derelict that was the ship he commanded.  Beyond that its not that different from other dungeon core stories.  The ""hero"" must gather power and materials, discover new creatures and create them to defend his derelict.<br /><br />The rules are supposedly very similar to those in any fantasy based dungeon and the races we see are kobolds, dwarves, orc and humans, with elves mentioned.  The dungeon does use a lot of firearms and lasers, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense on a space ship since a hull breach would be a bad idea.  But then again, the ship has some kind of internal gravity.<br /><br />I think that and a few other little things helped make me feel this could have been much, much better.  Even the tense moments and action scenes felt a bit forced rather than clean tales of adventure.<br /><br />Its not bad, and the idea is solid, but I think the author forgot to link in a solid plot with good flow.  The story is choppy and uneven with a final third that felt more like an anticlimax than a good solid climax to the story.  This clearly ended in the middle, with no plot threads resolved.<br /><br />I'll probably try book 2, but compared to others in the genre, this is not one of the better books.",3.0,0,2020
Loved this one,"I'll start by saying that I obviously don't know enough about Dicken's writings to recognize all the lovely nods to his book in the writings of this book. I loved the notes at the end from the author pointing to each one. Very interesting info.<br /><br />Next let me say that I gave the first in this series 5 stars and I loved this one even more than the first! Can I give this one 5+ stars? Part of what made me love it more was better understanding of how the series progresses compared to Dicken's A Christmas Carol. At the end of the first one I felt odd at only seeing Scrooge have his visit from Christmas Past but not the other ghosts. For some reason it didn't compute in my brain that the other visits would be in the rest of the series. Duh! It only makes sense but I hadn't gotten that until I read this one. I didn't realize that all the books were happening at the same time and would all visit Scrooge on the same Christmas Eve.<br /><br />I loved both main characters even if I was frustrated by Lord Chapman's slowness in fixing the problem he created. Helena was brilliantly patient in dealing with him when he had caused all her problems. Of course a little pepper solves everything anyway, right? Haha. You'll have to read the book to get that one.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book was wondering what Mr. Baker would do had things not played out how he anticipated. I'd like to know if he'd gone through with it. Doesn't really matter though. All's well that ends well.<br /><br />No sex, language or violence<br />*I received a complimentary ARC of this book and voluntarily chose to review it.",5.0,1,2020

Religious Women's Fiction,"The synopsis of the novel captured my attention right away.  Five seemingly random people receive an anonymous invitation to attend the Fifth Avenue Story Society to be held in a beautiful private, turn of the 20th century, library in New York.  Curiosity causes them to attend, even though they don't know what the society is or why they were invited or even by whom.  It isn't long before the five - Coral, a cometic company owner dubbed the Panicked Princess for jilting a prince; Jett, an associate English professor; Lexa, an executive assistant for a high powered food chain; Ed, an elderly man pining for his wife years after her early death; Chuck, divorced and kept from his children - form a bond and begin to tell their stories.  The stories and the characters are compelling.  Three quarters of the way through the book, religion crept in, and for me, dimmed my appreciation of the book.  I finished it, of course, and did mostly enjoy it.  After reading it I did see that the classification was religious fiction.  That was my mistake in not fully looking into the author who was new to me or to the classification noted.  It would have been a fine book without the religious implications.",4.0,1,2020

Fantastic advice for NaNoers who want to actually finish a novel,"The introductory part of the book, about the benefits and pitfalls of NaNoWriMo, spoke to me. Like the author, I've completed NaNoWriMo many times but it almost never results in something workable. I just finished writing a novel that did *not* start as a NaNo draft, but struggled a lot with plotting. Coming up with clever plots has always seemed like magic to me. This book demystifies the process with clear instructions and a solid example.

Switched at Birth,"So the swapped baby cliche story is not so cliche this time.  Pete and his partner Maddie have an adorable and precocious (get into everything) son named Theo.  Pete is a stay at home dad after his job as a freelance reporter disappears.  Miles and Lucy Lambert are the wealthy parents of little David, not precocious, in fact barely aware of his surroundings.  When Miles insists that the children were switched at birth at the NHS hospital, Pete can’t believe it, until they visit the Lamberts and meet David.  Thus, the couples form an alliance against the evil hospital that gave them the wrong children.  Unfortunately, all is not as it seems and it may not be the hospital that is the evil entity here.  Pete and Maddie may not be a traditional family, but they will have to unite in order to defeat the evil that they have welcomed into their lives, unsuspecting of how nefarious the Lamberts may actually be.  I loved the spider web feeling of this book.  The deeper I got into the plot, the more intricate it became, with layer upon layer of deception.  The characters were no one that I would want to meet, ever, except maybe Pete, who seemed to be a happy-go-lucky man who just wanted the best for his son.  But even Pete, I kept waiting for another shoe to drop and for me to find out something dark about him, too.  Starting as a slow pace, the pace picked up quickly for me and this book was a thoroughly enjoyable psychological thriller.  Fans of Delaney and thrillers will enjoy this book, but be prepared for some really unexpected twists.<br />Disclaimer<br />Disclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

Was a good read,"Since I've started reading Elin Hilderbrand's books just a few months ago, I've surprised myself at how much I've enjoyed them.  Usually when I start an established author's books, I like to read them in order, but in this case, I have not done that. I started with 28 Summers which I really enjoyed and then Summer of 69 which was good, then went on to the Beach Club,  and I really liked that one, then the Rumor followed by Tailgate and then The Matchmaker. The problem I thought I would have was not liking these kind of snooty, entitled characters (for the most part) who get to summer practically all year long, drinking,  partying and gossiping about everyone.  However,  I became attached to most of the characters in these stories and never had to force myself to finish any one of these I've read so far. I've even looked forward to getting back to where I left off when I had to stop.  So, I've become a ""fan"" of Elin Hilderbrand's  summery beach reads, even after I read the reviews of others on each of her  books before buying them and wasn't  sure if I'd like these stories.  I'd like to offer my ""thanks"" to Elin for her style of writing that pulls the reader into a world of  escapism from our own daily grinds and especially during these difficult times we're all experiencing happening around us.",4.0,1,2020

Annoying as hell,This book started out beautifully.  I don't understand how this got 5 stars no lie.  But as soon as Andie finds out abt werewolves her common sense goes out the window. She believes a family she doesn't fully know. A family her mom left and changed her name and everything to get away from. Then goes to hating ppl who were nice to her and never truly did anything bad to her just because they are werewolves. The case being made for why she should hate werewolves or anything just wasn't solid. The storyline was frustrating. The ending made no sense to me. How do you get mad at someone protecting you? So many untruths. And I'm one to give a storyline leeway but nothing added up and Andie was a heroine type that I hate. You just want to shake sense into her. At this point I'm mad I paid for this. I kept expecting it to get better. The only decent scenes were the ones with Andie and the wolf pack at the onset of the story.,2.0,0,2020

Digital only good for reference,I'm an instructor whose course uses the Marieb textbook. This study guide (in print) is fantastic if your course is also using Marieb's textbook as it is closely aligned with each chapter. It is very helpful to students.  I would give it 5 stars for that purpose.  If you just want a coloring book for general anatomy practice then buy one of the regular stand alone coloring books.  I purchased the digital Kindle copy simply for quick reference.  DO NOT buy the digital copy if you need it as a true study guide as you will not be able to do the exercises such as the coloring pages.  That is why I have only given this 3 stars as it refers to my digital purchase.  Go ahead an purchase the print copy if you need it for actual practice and review.

One of Middlebrow's best,"I've been on a Middlebrow binge during the pandemic - something about social drama\comedy that takes place in Great Britain and Scotland around World War 2 is a soothing escape. I've loved most of what I've read but didn't realize how weary I had become of so very many virtuous women until I read Miss Mole. At first I wasn't sure I liked her but by the end of the book I adored her. So intelligent, resourceful, and funny - of course she didn't fit in anywhere. Miss Mole would thrive in 2020, but in her own day and age she had to hide her brilliant light under several bushels. On the page she is a living, breathing, brilliant but flawed character who dares to believe good things could still happen when no one else did, to value herself highly even when no one else would.

A waste of time and money - save yours,"This is yet another short story, packaged up by the author and sold as a full story or at the very least a story that is the first in a series.<br /><br />I think a lot of people have been down this road before. First, she demands that her ARC team review everything with five stars, or she tells them not to review at all (I remember the emails that drove me away from her ARC team). That defeats the purpose of reviews.  She writes juvenile stories that are more like soft porn with little plot, and no character development.  I was a huge fan of her Mr. Black series until Book 4 when it became obvious that at least four of the books could be combined into one and make it far more satisfying to the reader (but wouldn't make the author all that much money, which is what Charlotte Byrd is after).<br /><br />In the case of this book, it is a cliffhanger, and does not tell you that. I know a lot of other authors who write a series of books and each is a stand alone, giving the reader an opportunity to enjoy a FULL book without having to buy more to find out what happens.  Sorry, but a lot of people don't like this, especially the part about not saying its a cliffhanger in the blurb.  Me? I'm thoroughly disgusted by what sounds like a book written by a teenager, and certainly not by an adult who has worked on their craft and understands it.<br /><br />My advice?  Learn to write a book with proper characterization and plotting, up your game and write an ""adult"" heroine who isn't scared into situations that are full of drama and nothing else.",1.0,0,2020
Toxic masculinity and shabby writing,"Yikes, what is with all the 5 star reviews for this hot mess? I read this for free with kindle unlimited, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I knew within about 10-20 pages that I was going to have an issue with the lead male, who right off the bat physically assaults the narrator (who is clearly helpless at the time). The writing is unpolished and clunky, like a bad fan- fiction. There are lots of run on sentences that lack commas along with: Sentences. Written. Like. This. For. No. Reason. Why!! It's not a stylistic choice; it's just bad!<br /><br />The ONLY reason I actually finished the book was a mild curiosity to find out who the main character actually is... Memory loss is used as the main plot device here, and it only works for so long. Very little of the fantasy world is explained, a lot more characters are introduced at the end, and the love interest remains little more than a hot piece of meat. The ""playlists"" sprinkled in the beginning of some chapters are just... asinine.<br /><br />This is probably something that fans of Fifty Shades will enjoy, but the very poor writing was distracting from a pretty weak plot to begin with. Read Sarah J. Maas, Ilona Andrews, and Miranda Honfleur instead for well-crafted fantasy romance! This is definitely not on par with my standards (and I'll read just about any trashy fantasy romance).",1.0,0,2020
Compelling read,I've never read Patricia Highsmith so I can't draw comparisons.  I found this to be a compelling read - it was prefect for escaping the Election night madness.  I knew nothing about accounting nor the contemporary art market and it was interesting peeking into these unknown areas.<br />It's the tale of mousy small town city comptroller who embezzles millions of dollars to fund her secret life as a wheeler dealer in the contemporary art scene.  Reading the afterward I discovered the story is loosely based on a true story and has been the subject of a documentary.  All the Queen's Horse's is available on Amazon Prime & it's well worth watching.,4.0,1,2020
"Okay, could be better","This is the first in the Althea Rose cozy mystery series. The story is okay, although I figured out whodunit long before the end of the book. Thea is a psychic and her best friend and business partner Luna is a white witch, so be prepared for mind reading and spells. And then there's the older lady who practices voodoo. If this bothers you, this book is not for you. There are several men involved. Beau is gay and is Thea and Luna 's close friend who also owns a bar. Trace is the guy that Thea goes diving with to take her underwater pictures for her blog. Cash is the hunky new guy in town. There isn't much character development but maybe that's coming. It felt like I was reading a later book in the series, though. Basically nothing about Thea's blog or if she makes money off it. Not much about the business she shares with Luna. Thea does tarot card readings and Luna sells potions on a small Florida key named Tequila. If the island and town are that small, not sure how they stay in business. What bugged me most about this book is the description of Thea's physical reactions every time she sees a good looking guy. Or touches one. Good grief, I didn't act or feel that way even when I was a teenager, much less as an adult woman. Okay, maybe when I saw the Beatles in person when I was 15, but hey, the Beatles! I am tired of reading cozy mysteries where the main female character has overactive hormones and/or acts like a ditz. This could be a better book with more realistic emotions and dialogue. Oh, and I don't know how many times someone spat out their words. These characters do a lot of spitting! Hope the later books in the series are better but I don't know if I will read any more. If you want a cozy series that has a realistic, down to earth, smart not sassy main character, read the Jamie Quinn series.",3.0,0,2020
JCO did it again!,"I am a big fan of Joyce Carol Oates so I expected a lot from this book.  I use the Kindle and I must admit that up to 40% of this book, I regretted the purchase and I seriously thought this prolific writer needed to retire.  I just could not get into the book.  Here was a crime based on racial profiling (so relevant!) with the patriarch of the story seriously hurt and a good part of the beginning focused primarily on his wife and her suffering.  I really thought of just giving up on the book to read something else, but I'm glad I didn't because right around that junction (40% by Kindle measure) the characters started to become more ""fleshed out.""  Once I got into this story I had to smile and say to myself:  She (Oates) will not be rushed and she will peel this onion very slowly at her own determined pace as she leads you through the layers one by one.  She is a master of her craft for a very good reason and I will continue to look for her work.  Brilliant!!",5.0,1,2020
I felt like I was watching a dumpster fire,"Once again I've run into a review I don't want to write and that I'll admit not everyone will agree with.  I really liked the concept of this series and while I had a couple of quibbles with the first book, it was solidly thought out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can only describe the plot of book 2 as a complete dumpster fire.  Its not coherent.  It violates its own canon and timeline, and worst of all, it dehumanizes so many characters that its nearly impossible for me to enjoy it.<br /><br />But all of my problems can be tied to the LitRPG nature of the story and the fact that there doesn't appear to be a foundation for the stats and abilities.  They are just thrown together as needed resulting in strange combinations and far too little structure to how powerful people are.<br /><br />Warning - some people might consider parts of what I talk about after this as spoilers.<br /><br />I'm going to start with one of the most obvious and in my opinion glaring flaws with the LitRPG system first.  Micheal is an old soul, who got to the final battle of humanity and then got sent back 10 years to try again.  He KNOWS how to train and how to use his abilities.  Yet, multiple times in this book he whines that others who started at the same time as him are more powerful than him.  HOW!!!  He's used an elixir they have no idea exists.  He started with Ki Cultivation on day one, he's been hunting Golden Morenkai for the 10K+ points each and yet, he keeps running into people who started at the same time who are somehow MORE powerful than him?<br /><br />So we have my issues with the ability system which is broken badly.<br /><br />But then we have the characters and their actions.  First, he's got at least 2 ""webmaster"" type characters who sit and plot and get others to do what they want.  Here its Director Prime (who is never really defined as a person, but at least he's in the same world) and of course the Vile King (who is 3 layers above the group, but thanks to a completely broken ability can corrupt anyone at anytime and turn them evil.)  But in both cases, why?  The Vile King supposedly wants humanity to ""struggle"" but why would he care about anyone so far away from him.  It wouldn't matter how powerful he is, its more that those people are too far away.  He gets nothing from acting.  Sure you could have his personality be some weird OCD type that wants to meddle, but then why would he have left them behind so that he can't be there to watch?<br /><br />But even beyond that, there are too many people who have supposedly been in the world for a year or more (first to third wavers) who lack common sense.  I've read too many backstabs, secret meetings and plottings that should never have happened.  Heck the leader of one of the 3 great organizations of the Main Cluster was poisoned by someone with the Poison Ruler ability.  Do you really think that organization would allow anyone with that ability to live?  The leaders who would naturally fear assassinations would hunt down anyone with that ability.  You also see people wandering about with masks to hide their real faces.  NO, not happening.  Even the leaders of those organizations would fear that the other side would sneak someone in under a mask (as Micheal does a couple times.)<br /><br />Its just the frightening levels of illogic combined with the non-nonsensical rankings and abilities that bounces me out of my immersion.  The fact that Micheal is NOT a hero (he says so himself). just makes it worse.<br /><br />I won't be moving on to the second layer when the series advances.  My enjoyment is gone due to the lack of restraint on the part of the author.  He wanted to have too much in his tale and left a mess that is less than enjoyable to read.",2.0,0,2020
Don't bother,"I gave up on this book at page 50 or about 18%.  I fast-forwarded to the last two chapters hoping to find a reason to go BACK to page 50.  Nothing there.  Please, if you have a story to tell, TELL IT.  Don’t flip back and forth, back and forth between the two points of view of Petrona and Chula. This was a poor choice of technique.  The vagueness and “cloud everything in mystery” is so typical of Latin American writers.<br />Another complaint is the author peppers the narrative with Spanish which she does NOT put in italics nor does she define.  I am fluent in Spanish but not familiar with Colombian colloquialisms.  On page 2 she writes:  “ . . . we lived in Bogotá:  Petrona Sanchez at the invasión between Street 7 and 48.”  What?  I had no idea what invasión meant in the context of this sentence.  An invasion between two streets?  Thanks to Google, I found out it means a SHANTY TOWN in Colombia.  Other examples are salados, paras, arepas, cachaco, encapotados.  You lost me.<br />Why would the author, her editor and agent allow this?<br />What about readers who don’t know a word of Spanish?<br />It felt deliberate, as if to say, “if you don't speak our lingo, too bad, you’re excluded.”<br />I’m glad I only paid $1.99 + tax for this book.  Sadly, the author missed the opportunity to tell what I’m sure is an important story about Colombia.",2.0,0,2020

Disappointed,"I rounded down from 3.5 stars. This book was very disappointing, there was no character development at all.<br /><br />Elizabeth was the same Elizabeth in all his other books and had exactly zero changes the entire book, even after what would've been a fairly traumatic experience to a woman in the 1800's.<br /><br />Do we really think Fitzwilliam  Darcy would allow a relative to act as Lewis de Bourg does, towards any woman but especially towards a woman he supposedly loves? Throughout the book all he does is continue to warn him if he acts that way again he'll take action, then de Bourg does it again but Darcy doesn't take action, just warns him again.<br /><br />Colonel Fitzwilliam throws one punch but then immediately apologizes for it?  Are we for real?  An army man with considerable training is going to feel bad about saving a gentlewoman?<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's because Jessie Lewis' Darcy in Mistaken has given me unrealistic expectations for a strong,  powerful,  principled, loving and sensitive Fitzwilliam Darcy but I do know Love and Libertine falls flat.  It's unfortunate as Jann Rowland is a talented author.",3.0,0,2020
Took a minute to bite,"The first part of this book was boring. It didn't really get moving for a while. I almost gave up on on the book but I am glad I stuck it through.

Things didn't really start moving along until Jacky met Heath although the interaction with Brin was interesting and one that will surely come into play later.<br /><br />I while I liked Jacky and Carey I thought that their interaction and connection was a bit quick. That being said Jackey came across as formidable and relatable. She didn't seem super human and made mistakes that were ""human"". She and her interaction w Heath reminds me a bit of Mercy and Adam in the Mercy Thompson series. By the end I couldn't put this down but it took a while to get there.

Immigration,"Today the word immigration is a word that sparks emotion.  The United States was a country formed by immigrants and the basis of all we stood for when we began.  Yet today we have lost the meaning on both sides.  Immigrants when they came in the early years of our country were also seeking a better life and freedoms, they came here and endured the hardships of each generation, but they became our country.  Now we look on immigration as a bad thing.  Most of today’s immigrants are facing unbearable lives and risk everything to come here.  I agree we need to have controls set in our country on entry and that there needs to be legal entryway, however are today’s immigrants any different then our first groups?  Fleeing oppression of religion and government.  I think today’s immigrants are actually possibly worse off they are literally fleeing for their lives, sometimes with only the items they can carry.  In this book you will follow several peoples journey as they make their way to crossing the boarder.  Listen to their stories and you decide.  The horror that they are escaping from only to find more on the journey.  The kindness of strangers they get help from. The bonding of the group as they travel together.  The sadness of loss in so many ways, emotionally, physically, how these make the stronger and leave some wounds that will forever be there. We need to stop illegal immigration but first we need to recognize we are all the same and that the humanity of kindness and understanding needs to be part of the process too.",5.0,1,2020

A writing style and plot development I did not like,"This novel is certainly of a different kind and one not particularly to my liking. It is basically a collection of character vignettes, like character studies an author would create as background for writing a novel containing much information the author would ultimately never include in the actual novel. The vignettes bounce around from current time to years ago to some time in between back to the current time. Sometimes it seemed like there were flashbacks in the midst of flashbacks.<br /><br />There are a number of new characters introduced by such vignettes. Well into one, I would find out this character has had dealings with someone who is a good friend of a previously introduced character. I painfully exercised patience to see how the lives of all of these people would intersect. I have to admit I found myself skimming over lengthy descriptions of places and events from the past that seemed to have no vital relationship to what was happening in the present.<br /><br />And I found none of the characters engaging. All of them were deeply flawed and either died during the course of the narratives or were just as dysfunctional at the end of the book as they were at the beginning.<br /><br />I did not appreciate the writing style. The novel is a prime example of lengthy passages of prose describing what people were doing or saying rather than actually having the people act or speak. There were no dialogue quotation marks, for example, but rather italicized sentences to indicate words spoken. Or were they words thought and not actually spoken? It was hard to tell and too confusing to take the time to figure it out.<br /><br />And at the end, I found myself saying, so what? Relationship issues were not resolved. Dysfunction and troubled people were still that way. I didn't learn anything interesting about some industry or occupation or geographical location. The prose was not particularly memorable. The novel wasn't terrible but rather just blah. I do not anticipate reading anything else by this author.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egally of this book from the publisher.

Fantastic book for helping your child adapt to the idea of kindergarten!,"Although this story would be great to read with any soon-to-be-kindergartener, it is especially well-suited for little ones with sensory challenges, social anxiety, or similar struggles. This book perfectly addresses many things that may be difficult for your kiddo when first starting kindergarten, and it explains with understandable language what the kitten, Clover, is feeling in each situation. Clover is overwhelmed, so her mom lets her stay home for a few days until she feels ready to try again, and then Clover finds ways to adapt to the sights, sounds, feelings, and interactions of kindergarten. Not only could this book help your kiddo to see and express themselves in a positive, adorable character, but it also offers a realistic blueprint for how to overcome these common challenges.

It was an expensive place that one of her parents paid for, although she didn't know who her parents are. She learned so much there, but ended up being a companion for a crotchety, selfish old widow with a cat and a dog that lived better than Joy.<br /><br />Mrs. Thackpenny was a bitter old woman with a vast amount of money that she refused to part with. There was never enough food, the house was cold, the servants were quiet and subdued, Joy--God bless her--was given a half a day off, rarely allowed to go outside, dressed in frumpy gowns, and waited on this ungrateful woman hand and foot. Mrs. Thackpenny needed a serious attitude adjustment and how she got it was pretty amazing.<br /><br />Dr. Morrisette was handsome and charming and well aware of what was going on at Mrs. Thackpenny's house. He had an acute interest in Joy and wanted to get spend time with her and get to know her, and how he worked over this crabby old woman was so fun to read.

"If you're expecting contemporary fiction, you might be in for a surprise...","3.5 stars<br /><br />Stories We Never Told was my first Sonja Yoerg novel, and for the most part, I was pleased with my Amazon First selection. The writing was compelling (I read most of the book yesterday afternoon), the characters came to life and jumped right off the pages, and the story was quite unlike anything I've read before.<br /><br />So, why the 3.5 star rating, Bridgett?<br /><br />The answer is this...Amazon listed this as contemporary fiction, but what I actually read was more a thriller/suspense. I was not expecting those elements and honestly felt they hindered the plot. To make things work, Yoerg added so many competing story lines, things quickly became convoluted and forced--Syrian refugees, parental disappointment, autism, ADHD, homosexuality, sociopathy, infidelity, murder, and more IT information than you could ever possibly want to know. It was just so much.<br /><br />Interwoven within the novel were chapters of each ""Character's (Insert name here) Story."" Most were unnecessary and added nothing to the story, but the options which did help move things forward gave away so many of the so-called twists, it made the ending anti-climatic.<br /><br />Overall, this was an above average read, and with a few tweaks, I think it could be brilliant.

"a ""hero's journey"" where the plot gets stuck in the mud.","The writing here is excellent in quality, and the main character isn't quite as bad as most harem MCs I've been finding.  The plot is even imaginative, with a lot of twists that are entertaining.<br /><br />But I find that I can't give this story 4 stars because it ran into a problem.  The authors here were clearly not confident in their plot and characters carrying the story.  Once Wes the high elf, the MC gets abandoned and marooned on the coast of a jungle/forest because he's too good at archery.  He encounters a young wood elf maiden and gets her to agree to take him to a port city so he can try to return home.  eight days later by the count in the book, they have spent 5 nights in the same tree house despite fighting their way through 2 ""dens"" of wood elves, saved a high elf expedition into a cave and are prepared to take out a 3rd den because it is supporting bandits.<br /><br />They either travel very, very fast, or this forest is made of nothing but extremely fertile soil and the best most bountiful fruit trees in existence.<br /><br />I know, I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief, but this book is titled ""Origins of a Pirate Lord"" and it seems lost in a jungle taking on epic monsters and corrupt wood elves.  at some point I just started wondering if there is any water in the hero's future.<br /><br />So due to the story seeming to be slightly mis-labeled for a long time, and the fact that the story really needs to start on its journey, and can't seem to until way too late, I have to mark this down a bit.  It really needed to show what it was headed for earlier rather than having the hero stumble about the forest running into every evil tribe since they all seem to live 5-6 miles from each other.",3.0,0,2020

I read for the joy of reading and can see the attraction of the books--however I also watched each movie after I finished a book and have to say--not that it surprised me at all--the books, including this one, are far better than the movie, even with all the CGI that makes ""eye-candy"" for the young folks who become Potterheads. The books, from 1 to 7 are all BETTER than the movies and I was amazed at how much Ms. Rowling allowed them to completely change whole sections and timelines of the story in the book, when transferred to the screen. In either case, I find this to be the darkest of the series and I personally wouldn't want a child of mine reading it until they were going on 16 because of language and the depth of rather dark imagery--I know kids today see and hear much worse, but I'm an old foggy and just think this should be reserved for upper teens as it definitely has the potential to create creepy imagery that could traumatize the younger children. Parents, you be the judge as to whether your kids can handle a lot of death, darkness, eerie scenes and sexual innuendo, (never direct) at whatever age is best suited for your kids.  Now that's my view as a parent and uncle... As a reader, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the series and have my favorites despite having read all seven... they are 1, 2, 6 and 7.  (I need closure and 7 provides that) .  For all my criticisms--if you enjoy fantasy, (and I love it) with some mystery and intrigue-- you'll like these books, and this is one of the best in the entire series.",5.0,1,2020
Disappointing,"For all I know, this book may well be deserving of five stars.  I managed to make it through the first story (nothing special) before I decided that I'm sick to death of King's snarky politicizing.  I think it would be in his best interests if he concentrated more on entertaining his constant readers and less on sharing his political views.",1.0,0,2020
Where ignorance makes technology magical,"In this post apocalyptic world, the human population has dwindled into provincial isolated villages. Through a combination of factors including hostile plant life, people don't leave their village for generations. The few pieces of old technology that survive are seen as quasi magical.<br /><br />Koli, who we meet at age 15, is a well drawn character with plenty of flaws, which the narrator (an older version of himself), frequently points out. But as ignorant as he appears at first, Koli is quite bright and capable.<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting the next book in the series, scheduled to be released September 2020.",5.0,1,2020
I loved this quirky book,"I'm a writer and an editor. This book was so much fun to read. It started out with such fancy writing that you had to re-read it twice or three times to understand it--usually a no-no for a book--but it was so intriguing I couldn't put it down. The metaphor for the politics that is going on in the country right now was on point, where people are afraid to speak their minds or have opinions that don't fall in line with the main stream media or you are cancelled. The leaders' antics are like those in ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" only in this book, even  if a child points out the idiocy, they are also punished. This book had some twists and turns and it was fun to try to keep up with the alphabet-speak. I loved the transitions to the spelling of the words. I actually had to read it aloud to be able to understand what they were saying. At one point, when read aloud, it sounded like phonetic German--another metaphor.<br />I was a quick read and I highly recommend it, especially for wordsmiths who love words and the English language. It really was genius.",5.0,1,2020
Excellent book,"Was hesitant about starting this book but when i did, I couldn’t put it down.  You’re immediately sucked into the story and feel yourself becoming entwined with the main character.

Daniel starts a tale out right,"There is a bit of a slow start here as the story begins in Gregory's home town where he is about to undergo a ritual that come with becoming an adult.  He has dreams based on this and for once in a tale, they appear to be coming true.<br /><br />Of course then we are off to the magical academy where hijinks, growth and romance combine into a rather well written and compiled story.<br /><br />I do have some quibbles with plot choices (but when don't I have quibbles with plot choices.) and I thought a few elements were not exactly logical.  But they work.  As a reader I liked Greg and Yukiko.  I was interested in their growth and I wonder about some of the hinted parts of the tale as it moves forward.<br /><br />A very solid effort from an author I've grown to like quite a bit, even if I don't think I'll ever finish his Alpha World series.",4.0,1,2020
Very American at times but it works,"I liked Alex, one of the two main characters even though he is the purest extraction of anime harem comedy ""wimp"" I've seen in a while.  He lacks any confidence in his ability to attract women, and that slowly becomes his big quirk.<br /><br />His partner J, well, honestly he had me shaking my head.  It felt like he was a bit of an author insert/proxy.  The guy is a near orphan, and older than normal for the school, but soon has 3 girls he's openly banging and proves to be one of the best fighters in his class.  (Gary Stu warnings about him kept ringing in the back of my head.  He's NOT well written).<br /><br />Strangely despite my major reservations about the main character and the obvious anime influences that made it far too obvious what was going to happen next on several occasions, it was a fun tale.  it works.<br /><br />I'll definitely check out the next book.<br /><br />One warning, this is NOT a cultivation story.  There is no meditation to improve mana flow or concentrate mana.  The author should really remove that claim from his title.",4.0,1,2020
"starts slow, finishes lovely","For me Devon Monk is an unpredictable author. Some of her series I like a lot (Ordinary), others I start off liking but peter out (Allie Beckstrom, Magic), still others I never got into (the sequel to Magic which just felt grim). This one I thought was going to be that last category, but it nudged over into the like column, mostly because about halfway through, it got an emotional buy-in from me. I’d spent the first half not sure who these people were or why I should care about them (it would have helped if the book had started with the attack on Lula and Brogan rather than just mentioning it several times with no details). Driving isn’t my thing, so the truck and the road didn’t offer me much. I also didn’t like Brogan getting so invested in derailing Jo and Cal’s prospective relationship—that made Brogan seem mean and rather petty, especially given how trivial the bet was that he was trying to win. I’m not really sure why I decided to invest in Lula and Brogan, maybe I finally understood their tragedy? maybe they showed up as good people in a very bad place? maybe Cupid loved them so they appeared lovable? I don’t know, but I do want to see what happens in the next book.",4.0,1,2020
Absolutely delightful!,"This series is so creative. It’s well written. I love the main characters. I think I’ve read the series 3 times now. I just bought the latest book in the series, and I’m very much looking forward to reading it AFTER I refresh my memory by reading the previous books all over again, which will provide me with even more hours of entertainment.  I don’t usually read books or series more than once, but there have been a few exceptions—this is one of the exceptions!",5.0,1,2020
"Enjoyable read, but relies on Karl's experiences with Trump & Co and little other research","This is a quick read, primarily telling Karl's experiences and reporting on Trump through the years (he first started interviewing him as a reporter for a NY tabloid in the 1990s, finding him as an often entertaining over-the-top egomaniac who was very accessible to the press. He even provided a quote--written by Karl, approved by Trump--for an invitation Karl was sending out to his new book launch party. It was humorous to have Trump's name on the invite).  Then twenty-five years later, they were both working in the White House, Trump, as the unlikely president, and Karl, as the WH correspondent for ABC News.<br /><br />I was prepared to like this book. I appreciate Karl's belief that reporters should recount facts and challenge people to provide them and should keep their own political biases--whether pro or con--out of their reporting.  But ""Front Row"", while a lively and entertaining read, was very disappointing.  He covers the campaign, for example, in an excruciatingly superficial way.  He mentions the ""Mexican rapists..."" speech at the beginning of the campaign, but doesn't develop the hostility toward immigrants as the Trump theme that it was.  He leaves out everything--""The Snake"" story, Pershing in the Philippines, the relentless messaging that immigrants from south of the United States are a threat, a danger, and must be stopped by a wall. This is one of the most important themes of Trump's candidacy -- AND of his presidency and undergirds his ongoing appeal for his base.<br /><br />This is a very mild, benign view of Trump's candidacy. Karl doesn't make much effort to lay out things in more than superficial detail. For example, he mentions Trump's anger at Megyn Kelly's questioning about his insults to women at the first Fox debate, and his subsequent ""feud"".  But he fails to mention the ""feud"" was one-sided, with Trump frequently attacking Kelly in tweets and comments, stirring up his supporters and even urging them not to watch her. He doesn't mention that Fox had to hire a bodyguard to protect her and her family--even going with them on vacation to Disneyland.<br /><br />Kelly's book described in surprising detail how Trump mysteriously learned of her question ahead of time then pressured her with phone calls not to ask it--even calling Fox exec producer Bill Shine (later, briefly comm director in the WH) to tell her not to do it.  Kelly refuses. She then describes the strange behavior of the driver who takes her to the studio and insists on getting her a Starbucks. Soon after drinking it, she becomes so ill that she had to keep a bucket next to her on stage during the debate in case she became sick.  She makes it clear that, while she has no proof and eventually shrugs off her suspicions, she can't help thinking that Trump somehow was involved with the driver and that he'd put something into her drink to make her unable to be at the debate.<br /><br />Karl includes none of that. He talks about the ""feud"" but doesn't give a sense that it spanned months until the ""truce"" arranged by Ailes.  While he talks about Ailes' role in that, he completely leaves out Ailes' long-time relationship with Trump and his early involvement in the Trump campaign (also well on record from other reporting.)  Karl talks about Fox being non-supportive of Trump for a long stretch--and skips over the dramatic turnaround to becoming his campaign propaganda network, with direct ties to his campaign and helping to spread falsehoods about Clinton. Karl makes it sound that CNN's constant coverage of him was a bigger help to him than Fox--something that might have been true in he early months, but not later. He talks about CNN's friendly coverage, but doesn't even mention Trump's long history with CNN president Jeff Zucker, former head of NBC when Trump was doing ""The Apprentice"".  He doesn't mention how Trump's first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, left the Trump campaign (but remained on its payroll through November) while being hired that same day as a CNN commentator.<br /><br />These are just a couple of examples of how Karl doesn't get below the surface, how his observations remain not just shallow but misleadingly shallow.  For example, he mentions the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape (Trump comments to Billy Bush where he describes and brags about sexual assault), but leaves out all the New York Times interviews with women who said the same. He mentions Trump lawyer Michael Cohen as a bit of a thug, but leaves out Cohen's behind-the-scenes payment to silence two women--a porn star and a Playboy model--who allege sexual relationships with Trump.<br /><br />He mentions the two big news events on the same day as the Access Hollywood tape--the Obama administration's statement about Russian interference in the election and WikiLeaks apparent help for Trump in dropping emails stolen from Clinton's campaign manager less than an hour after the tape's release.  He spends an inordinate time describing her speech to Wall Street described in the emails, but little -- little!!!-- about how Russian government had broken into the DNC computers back in spring and had been helping Trump in various ways for months through a Russian ""troll farm"", through military intelligence hackers, on social media spreading disinformation, and with the help of Assange and WikiLeaks.<br /><br />How could he just ignore that at this point? It has all been documented over and over, including in the Mueller report. Does a man who embraces that interference have the character to be president of the United States? It's not a question hat interests Karl, who doesn't even mention the ""Russia, if you're listening..."" press conference, or the meeting with Russian representatives and senior Trump campaign staff to get dirt on Clinton from the government in June. There's so much about Trump's campaign that is known now--that is sleazy (to say the least) and that provides another ongoing theme of his presidency.<br /><br />Karl isn't interested in any of that either.  He mentions Comey's letter publicly reopening the investigation of Clinton's emails eleven days before Election Day, and only mentions his earlier controversial appearance in summer as ""deciding not to indict her"".  One would know little about Trump's Democratic opponent from this book (he gives more attention to Podesta's anger over his emails' release and coverage than to anything Clinton said or did).<br /><br />If you think of the book being titled ""My Experiences with Donald Trump"" it might be a four-star. But this book has the aura of being presented for history and there it is just too superficial, with too little effort at reporting and research beyond what he already knows, to be more than a book that will provide anecdotes for other, more important, looks at the Trump presidency.",3.0,0,2020
"Oh, so worth the wait! A new couple in love! Widdershins is about to become hot spot again!","Widdershins is back! Eight years after the not quite end of the world and show down with the Masters, we return to Ladysmith Museum, but this time we enter the sacred walls of the Library and start discovering all its secrets. Very enjoyable new angle at the shadowy monsters, power of arcane and love beyond measure. There is mystery, there is betrayal and there is redemption. I enjoyed seeing Mr. Quinn, the head librarian, in his element. I liked the internal goings on in the library and how all the librarians saw themselves as protectors.<br /><br />Sebastian Rath is a likable fellow with penchant for amateur sleuthing and so much curiosity that just might get him in trouble. He is a devoted brother and a wonderful archivist. Vesper Rune despite his childhood and origins is kind and caring man. The choice that brings him to Sebastian might not have been wise but in the end it feels like Widdershins is exactly where he is meant to be. Vesper finally finds his self worth and a place in this world and Sebastian finds someone to love and cherish.<br /><br />I loved secondary characters. They represented different walks of life and families of Widdershins. I liked that Endicotts seemed to have assimilated well into the town life and its inhabitants. Widdershins is a special place that keeps its secrets close to the vest and accepts those who are lost and in need of guidance. Ves and his brother Noct find what they have been looking for all their lives - family and a place to belong to. This was steadily paced, mildly steamy, angsty and medium suspenseful PNR romance full magic, high emotions and a cast of wonderful characters that I want to know all about. I enjoyed the storytelling and will definitely read the next one!",5.0,1,2020

So confused,"I don’t understand why this book had to suddenly go so so wrong. This is a new author for me. I was really enjoying this book and the connection between the two characters. This is the best example of a single scene ruining an entire book that I have ever seen. Especially one that made absolutely no sense and didn’t belong in the book. The characters have been around each other for weeks, and signs are pointing to the hero being really into the heroine. It’s been a week or two since there first kiss and they just spent the night together for the first time. They are at a restaurant eating lunch when a “hot blond” walks up to their table. The hero gets up and greets her KISSING HER ON THE CHEEK. And greets her by name. She begins hitting on him and he says he is there with someone else. She keeps going and gives him back a baseball cap saying “you left this at my place”. When she finally leaves after hitting on him some more, the heroine of course is irritated and begins pulling away. He literally will not let her and all he has to say is that the woman was a mistake in that he made once and isn’t planning to make again. Not once does he (nor does he ever in the book) explain when he was with the woman. No once does he even offer “it was before you and I started hanging out”. To me that says it was recent. The heroine isn’t happy and again tried to pull away and says that they should probably cut their losses. He won’t let her. He picks her up and locks her in his car, takes her back to his place and won’t let her leave. This is all done in an almost cutsie manner, but he says he isn’t letting her get away. Then she just goes with it and that’s the end of that. He never clarified anything about the woman. Later it’s revealed that he had had a crush on the heroine for years, and he says that he was in love with her. I can understand if that was true why he was having one night stands while she was right there beside him, and he had kissed her. I also can’t understand why he would risk that to kiss and his a former one night stand while on a date with the heroine?!?! And to never talk about it again? Illogical and irritating. To say the least. I was still fuming when I finished the book. It was lazy writing and ruined a good read for me. This is a first for me so I will try the author again. I’m hoping it was just a one time mistake and not representing her typical writing style.",2.0,0,2020
Quick read,"Ryker Conway is a college Football player who has been hurt before by a girlfriend so now he is just a player so he does not get hurt again.

In the process of her terms of being around her he ends up actually liking her and gets to know her better. Harper has a bit of a past and it is trying to catch up with her. Things get complicated and Ryker ends up wanting to protect her from her past.<br />I did not think this was going to be about people in college and it was a little darker than I expected. It was a decent quick read. It was written well enough that I wanted to slap a few people a couple of times for being evil and mean.<br />I received this book for free from eBook Discovery.

"Not Sookie, but still good","It’s interesting that one of the blurbs I read for this book compared the protagonist, Ann Kinnear, to Sookie Stackhouse, the main character in Charlaine Harris’s Southern Vampire Mystery series.  I find that a fairly  unjustified comparison as the two characters are almost nothing alike, their paranormal talents are very different, the settings opposite, urban vs. rural, and their very characters very dissimilar.  I don’t wish to imply that I did not enjoy this book because I did, but to let other potential readers who enjoyed the Sookie books know that these books are very different.<br /><br />There is one trait that Ann and Sookie share and that is their  uncomfortable relationship with their respective paranormal talents.  Ann can sense the essence or presence of the dead while Sookie could hear people’s thoughts. Each talent has its own set of burdens and part of both books is how they manage it.  Both have come to terms with it but while Sookie maintains a fairly sunny, social disposition, Ann tends to be more burdened by it and thus, more reclusive.<br /><br />As to the story itself, it’s well written, fairly well paced, and entertaining.  Character development is good for both the main and secondary characters. Will I read more in the series?  Absolutely.  This book may not have the down-home relatability and charm of the Sookie books, but it is an engaging read.",4.0,1,2020

The H is just as bad, he lost a girlfriend 10 yrs ago and hadn't moved on.  Yeah he had a new girlfriend but didn't really want to move forward with that relationship, they had sleepovers, but when she asked about moving in together he told her he wasn't ready to move forward with her.

Dragon tale that drags on incessantly,"It is very rare for me to leave a 1 or 2 star review. I read a lot of books and even if a book is bad, I try to give it a chance. Unfortunately, this book was pretty dismal. First, I'm not sure if the author bothered to hire an editor. There were so many glaring grammatical errors that I just could not ignore. The most annoying was how the tense would change to past and present 3rd person on the same page Furthermore! Furthermore, there were entire chapters that were exceedingly mundane and completely irrelevant to the plot line. I HATE books that are filled with fillers to boost the word count. A good editor would have taken a red pen to a good portion of the book.<br /><br />Next: there is no character development in this book. At all. All of the characters are flat and I have no desire to read further. The thing is, the plot summary sounds great. This story had potential. But it was not realized. I'm not sure who is reading this book and doling out so many 5 star reviews, but I suppose my standards are just too high.

When they found themselves in the middle of a real life mystery, they found themselves referring to their books they'd read for what to do next.<br /><br />I think at one point I realized who the killer was, but it was fun reading how it played out.

Awesome trilogy!,"Witch of the Lake is one of the best trilogies I have ever read!<br /><br />Feast of the Mother - Book 1<br />Brygida, a witch isolated her whole life from the outside world, now tasked with being a reaper to serve justice for a heinous crime. Kaspian, a soft soul accused by all of taking the life of his bride-to-be, knows he will face the reaper if found guilty yet has no memory of the crime. Brygida fights for his innocence, while everyone else has deemed him guilty. But is he? Will she save him or reap him afterall? This was an excellent, good old-fashioned whodunit, with a wonderful supernatural flair, set in a world sure to give you gosebumps while you are reading.<br /><br />Fate of the Demon - Book 2<br />Wow! Brygida is faced with trials upon trials. She is desparately trying to save the life of another, even while her own life is in peril. Along with Kaspian and Stefan, Brygida sets foot on a quest to slay a demon, but ends up in a very deadly standoff. Decisions must be made and consequences paid by all, including Brygida. Will she survive, pick up the pieces and forage on?<br /><br />Fall of the Reaper - Book 3<br />Fall of the Reaper is my favorite book in the Witch of the Lake trilogy. It grabbed me right from the start and never let go. Brygida struggles between two gods, one she is bound to and the other she hopes to redeem herself to. Unfortunely for her, these two gods seem to serve opposing sides, forcing Brygida to make some seriously tough choices along the way. Meanwhile, Kaspian is struggling to rule in his father's footsteps. To make matters worse, the Cult of Weles has infiltrated Rubin.<br /><br />It was exciting to witness the personal growth both Kaspian and Brygida experienced. I also enjoyed more development of some of the secondary characters. The storyline is fast-paced and unique, filled with magic, demons, cult-mentality, danger and intrigue.

However, the low carb version that is provided in this cookbook, which they give you two different recipes where one is with coconut flour and the other with almond flour, you can now have low carb fried chicken. This makes me and my tummy super happy and excited.<br /><br />It then goes into some amazing and delicious-sounding cajun recipes, including making your own cajun seasoning.

Not liking this so far (Update at end of review),"I’m only 14% in, so my rating may change, but so far it’s pretty bad. Enemies to lovers isn’t my favorite genre, but the vitriol and hatred in the first few chapters is pretty severe. Plus, are we done with no meaning no between men and women? Like, I thought that was a thing. If a man keeps pursuing a woman who says no, isn’t that tantamount to rape? That’s what leftists have been screaming for awhile anyway. Maybe that rule changed, it’s hard to keep up. I always buy Vi Keeland books sight unseen, but I suppose I’ll have to download a sample first from now on.

You’re my first love, you know me.” But now she’s going for a walk in the garden with Max the next day and she’s back to being in love with him.  And Max is just showing that he’s immature as well, he’s making out with everyone but “I’ve loved you since I first saw you, America.”  Plainly put, I will not waste another ten dollars to read the third book.  You know how some books leave you swooning for days on a good way?  Well this one has had me pissed since I finished it.",2.0,0,2020
My Favorite Abe Moss Book,"I have read all of Abe Moss' books except for The Writhing.  And this is by far my favorite., although I've enjoyed them all.  Little Emmett came close.  Under The Wicked Moon had me turning pages throughout, all the way to the end.  I was not bored for one minute.  There were the usual monsters, of course.  Pay attention to the prologue--it's important.  I eagerly await the next book from Abe Moss.",5.0,1,2020
Not what I expected.,"For some reason I had thought this would be about the legend of the poinsettia. It wasn't. However, I simply looked it up on the computer to read the legend once more after I read this short story. The story revolves around Zetta, a poinsettia waiting to be purchased at the plant and seed store. How she wants to go home with someone! As it turns out Zetta not only finds a home, but she is given a place of prominence where she can be seen by everyone and also feel part of the family's Christmas. She is filled with joy!<br /><br />However, as we all know (and Zetta is learning) Christmas doesn't last forever. The lights and decorations are put away for another year, and the tree is thrown out. Poor Zetta worries if she will be tossed out like the tree. Things aren't looking as hopeful any more.<br /><br />Follow Zetta's story and see what becomes of her. I have to say it certainly isn't what happened to all the poinsettias my mother received through the years. Let Zetta find a place in your family this year, and look up the legend of the poinsettia. This little plant was (according to legend) a very special gift.",4.0,1,2020

Do not break the fourth wall!,"I am familiar with the ""fourth wall"" in the theater, but this book was the first time I ever encountered it in a book. I could hardly believe it and should have given up immediately, but I hoped the author would redeem herself. No such luck. When an author says of her female protagonist, ""she's our girl,"" that's an affirmation that doesn't belong there. It should be up to the reader to decide if she's ""our girl."" There was a similar break in the wall with the male protagonist, leading the reader to believe he was a ""good guy."" Unfortunately he was not. He was weak, cowardly, and did not deserve to be loved so well by ""our girl.""<br /><br />It is rare for me to get this steamed about a book. I suspect other people liked it, but I wouldn't even give it away since I wouldn't want anyone else to have to deal with the long and painful explication of a third-rate story.",1.0,0,2020

Surprisingly bad,"I’m not normally into bully romances, but I figured why not? Big mistake. Where to begin?<br /><br />First of all, the author needs to do a little research before writing. Femoral artery? That’s in the leg. The carotid artery is in the neck. High school seniors (especially ones that claim to want to graduate so desperately), would know the location of major arteries. It’s covered in basic biology and anatomy.<br /><br />Secondly, there’s an excessive amount of repetition in this book. If I had to read “inked” or “ebon” one more time I was going to lose my mind. There was no attempt to describe these guys outside a handful of words that were recycled continuously.<br /><br />Also, the emotions of this main character was shallow. The reader wasn’t able to feel what this character felt, we were just told “I hate myself” or “I was probably having a PTSD episode” and things along those lines. How are the readers supposed to connect to that? I have PTSD, and there was no detail or explanation covering how horrible a flashback or those feelings are. None. No attempt whatsoever to give this chat any emotional depth.<br /><br />This book was just a weird underage erotica (oof), with violence thrown throughout, horrible editing, horrible writing, and a lot of self hatred.

"OK, but flawed plot","There is a serious flaw in this plot that I couldn't get past no matter how hard I tried.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />The Golds spend all this time and energy to find the very best of the best.  They bring them to this school and then allow them to kill each other off.  If this is supposedly the best of your society, why would you kill off 75 percent of them?  To me that sounds like a formula for the downfall of the Society.  As hard as they tried to rationalize it, I could never make sense of it.<br /><br />In the Hunger Games, they killed off people nobody cared about anyway and they did it for entertainment.  But in this, they kill off the cream of the crop as a way to train their leaders. How  does that make society stronger?<br /><br />The whole premise was a little too far-fetched for me.  That ""Carvers"" can create a superior being makes little sense.  All in all this was entertaining, but in my opinion, the plot flaws outweighed the entertainment value.<br /><br />I completely stalled at about page 280 and had to really force myself to finish this.  The dialog toward the end is atrocious with 16-year-olds quoting Cicero and Plato and discussing and instituting complex battle strategies.  I'd give this 2 1/2 stars, mainly because the beginning of the book was solid and drew me in.  It's a shame the second half couldn't live up.",2.0,0,2020
"Second chance, smalltown romance.","“A true second shot will split the first arrow and create a solid path.”~Declan<br /><br />The first time I read that phrase, I felt it so profoundly. Each of the 4 Arrowood brothers has a truth about an arrow that they learned as children and recited to their mother often. Declan's truth pertains so perfectly to his story.<br />""I can't be friends with him, Ellie. I can't. I can't talk to him and not want to kiss him. I can't look at him and not want to throw myself into his arms."" ~Sydney<br /><br />Declan and Sydney were childhood sweethearts, but one night changed everything. Declan wants to protect those that he loves to the point that he cuts them from his life. After his father's death, however, Declan is forced to come back to his childhood home for 6 months. It is obvious that Dec and Syd's love has not diminished, but Dec being the stubborn, mule-headed fixer that he is, refuses to see a way that things could be different. I spent the majority of the book wanting him to remove his head from his behind, and when he finally did, it was GLORIOUS, for me. Sydney, however, may have been less than eager to trust again so easily. Don't worry though Corinne Michaels did give us an amazing HEA with no cliffhangers.",5.0,1,2020
Solid DIY solar energy book,"The book begins with some very basic rules and terms. While these rules and terms are important to learn before setting up your own home for solar energy, they can be glossed over the first time your read the book.<br />Yes, if you intend to diy your green home, you should read this book more than once, and refer to it over and over again. That's not to say that you should avoid asking your local home depot employees questions, but if you read this book first, you'll know exactly what to ask them, and you'll actually understand what they tell you.<br />After the basics, there's some great information about panel size and orientation. This helps you understand how many panels you need, where to place them, and whether or not you can go full solar or just offset your standard electricity bill.<br />The book further explains the need for an inverter, how it works, and how to calculate ideal ratios.<br />I personally appreciated the list of manufacturers of solar panels and inverters, and how they accumulate and distribute energy to the home.<br />Overall, this is a solid, little textbook, which provides all the information needed for someone who already knows a little about electricity and solar energy. For those who know absolutely nothing about electricity and solar energy, it does teach just enough to allow the neophyte the confidence to either ask a professional and understand the answers, or do their own research.<br />The information provided in the the book does become more clear as it is read and reread, and the practical applications from the knowledge provided will also become more clear as one begins to actually buy and connect their panels.",4.0,1,2020

This poor woman can't even punctuate.,"I stumbled upon this book's unfortunate author on Twitter, where she was whining about the embarrassing election defeat of her hero, Donald Trump. Reading her blurb for this book on her website, I found one of the strangest attempts at an English sentence in history:<br /><br />""In a tale of Good vs Evil, Laura Loomer, investigative journalist pairs up with FBI Agent Maria Quintana-Deon to capture a Peruvian Maoist group of female assassins after blowing up the telecommunications site on Microwave Mountain, in order to stifle police, as they break a Mexican sicaria from prison and kidnap the CEO of the telecommunications company for ransom.""<br /><br />Right, that is all one run-on sentence. While she realizes that the modifying phrase ""investigative journalist"" has to be separated from its object with a comma, she doesn't realize that it has to end with a comma as well. When she gets into ""after blowing up..."" she fails to connect the clause to the nemesis group of female assassins, effectively asserting that Ms. Loomer did the site destroying. A site is a place on a map, not really subject to blowing up, so that's fun. She apparently meant there was some equipment on the site that was blown up.<br /><br />It is good to know that the Maoists kidnapped the CEO for ransom as opposed to,  I dunno, just for kicks.<br /><br />The prospect of wading through an entire book of similar sentences is quite depressing, so I'm giving this endeavor a pass. Some people shouldn't write books.<br /><br />By the way, Joe Biden is the President-Elect of the United States and Laura Loomer is a loser.",1.0,0,2020

When someone tells you who they are...,"I read this book when it first came out in the late 1980s, and was struck by how much it differed from prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's bestseller Helter Skelter. As brilliant as Bugliosi was, he was not able to get inside the head of someone like Manson. He viewed the entire landscape of the story through the eyes of a conventionally raised, successful midwestern ""straight arrow,"" who had always made sensible decisions in life.<br /><br />Charles Manson, who died in 2017 at the age of 83, after serving over 50 years for his most infamous crime,  lays himself bare in this book, which was written with the help of a former cellmate from the 1950s, Euel Emmons.  There is no question that Manson's view is often just as limited as Bugliosi's.  He refrains from blaming himself overtly for events, not to con the reader or spare himself the public's judgment, but because he's unable to peek over the horizon. He was born in the heart of 1930s Appalachia, where poverty of the spirit rivaled economic deprivation. He grew up before methamphetamine was rampant in the region, but the social remedies of the time (education and religion) were inadequate for many. Manson was raised amid contradictions: His mother was a teenage devil-may-care rebel; his grandmother and uncle were by-the-book moralists, with a hefty dose of traditional (i.e. toxic) masculinity thrown in. Depending on who was in charge of taking care of the boy at any given time, he was raised with all of these viewpoints.<br /><br />Manson certainly does come across as self-pitying and self-serving in much of the book, but for all that, there is a strong element of raw honesty in his account of his reform-school years. He escaped from his first incarceration, ran back home, and his mother promptly called the law and sent him back. Yes, we can be glad she didn't hide him and give him an opportunity for more crime on the home front, but he was quite young at the time; he admired his mother and the betrayal he felt is overlaid upon all the chapters that follow.<br /><br />Charles Manson was not a diabolical mastermind; he was an under-educated and emotionally immature man who made a lot of wrong decisions. Instead of trying to arrange employment when he was released from Terminal Island in 1967, he became a hedonistic drifter, which led to his career path as a ""cult leader,"" drug dealer, car thief and ultimately Svengali to a group of angry young adults who would go on to commit the horrifying murders of Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Steven Parent, Wojciech Frykowski, Leno LaBianca, Rosemary LaBianca, Gary Hinman and Shorty Shea (as well as others after the jury verdicts).<br /><br />Anger, frustration and resentment lie clearly at the bottom of Manson's actions.  A wise person sitting down with him before the summer of 1969 might have advised him to learn from other successful musicians and songwriters -- find a ""hook"" for his songs, rather than haphazardly pairing melody with freestyle poetry and feeling that becoming an overnight millionaire superstar was somehow his due. Get a real job, even a menial one, as opposed to making a living by pimping and stealing cars. He already knew the younger members of the group worshiped him and hung on his every word --  how much better off everyone would have been if he'd taken his leadership role seriously and led his followers down a more conventional and less harmful path. Lay off the drugs:  Inhibitions were loosened considerably at Spahn Ranch, and it was perhaps inevitable that Manson's class resentments communicated themselves to Susan Atkins, Tex Watson and Patricia Krenwinkel, who ultimately proposed striking terror into the ""pigs"" down in the Valley.<br /><br />Manson made clear that as his release from Terminal Island loomed, he felt overwhelmed by life on the outside -- he knew his judgment was limited -- and he wanted to stay behind bars. Perhaps the scared teenager from Kentucky was the one goading the adult Charlie to make all those unfortunate decisions that ultimately enabled him to get his wish.",4.0,1,2020

Meh...,"There is a trigger warning, and the scenes could be a lot more graphic. However... This could be considered a spoiler, but I don't care. This book starts out with a brutal rape and several vicious murders. And the rape is later revisited at the end of the book. So if that bothers or offends you, skip this book.<br /><br />That aside the premise for this book was familiar and good. Typical Alien protector rescues a stupid human from Slavers. The problem is world-building and storyline inconsistencies. There is a conclave of alien species, that humanity is rejected from because we are too primitive. Making us a protected species. However, humanity keeps insisting we are ready. About 50 years of known to the average person requesting. Yet a woman who has a sister in the space program is shocked at the sight of aliens. So people know about aliens, think we should join the conclave, but the lead female hasn't seen a picture of any species? We know that our lead male is from a warrior species and what he looks like. But that's it. We learn nothing about his culture or his homeworld. Just the typical instinctual recognition of their mates for life. There was also the lead male thinking there is a human government conspiracy because people look alike, even though siblings are an Alien thing too. But that got dropped and never discussed again.<br /><br />The lead male was fine. Tall, hot, large package, and confused by human language. The lead female was annoying. I don't think the women in these types of stories need to trust blindly. But I hate when they ignore the warnings of their rescuers in dangerous situations.

They want different things.<br /><br />This story was emotionally draining. So many times I wanted to yell at Declan to get his head out of his butt! These two have been meant for each other since they were teenagers and even though it took them way too long to get there, these two found their way home. Loved this story so much!",5.0,1,2020
Dated but fascinating,"This was my first Colin Wilson book and probably not my last. The story is about scientists discovering that humanity has a ‘mind parasite’ that confuses him, keeps his mind clouded and then proceeds to suck the life force out of man leaving him just enough to keep living until ‘at 80 he dies of boredom’. Geez, nice commentary on us.<br />Sounds a bit crazy until the scientist made the connection between cancer and not fulfilling your destiny and then it go real. This is what caught my attention and has had me thinking hard ever since. Here’s Wilson’s theory, we are all vibration—if you have a thought that you push away—say you always wanted to be a ..... that thought doesn’t go away, it just doesn’t get any more energy, and therefore sits like an irritant in a person. Multiply this idea across millions of minds, and you have a powerful thought form wanting attention—a thought form that was never given the energy to be realized so it sits at a lower vibratory level wanted to eat. Viola` you have a parasite that sucks on your lower energies.<br />Piaget, a famous psychologist igist said that the worse thing for children was their parents unrealized dreams. They project these dreams onto their unsuspecting progeny, driving them into doing what they might not want to do, but must because they love their parents.<br />My conclusion from what Wilson was trying to say, is that we can’t blame anyone else for our misery—it’s our own unrealized potential remaining a needy child trying to get our attention.",5.0,1,2020
The book you need right now!!,"I’ve been a fan of David Michie since I read Buddhism for Busy People years ago (2004) in which his journey from harried, caffeinated white collar worker in the chaos of London to his whole hearted dive into the ancient philosophy of Buddhism resonated deeply with me.<br /><br />Then I read the prequel to this book, (The Magician of Lhasa) which was pure delight...I didn’t want it to end ! In this book, his main character (Matt Lester) is a quantum scientist in nanotechnology whose life changes radically when he’s transferred to California and becomes neighbor to a mysterious monk. He begins having dreams that he’s a novice monk escaping from the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959.  It is slowly revealed the current day Matt is the reincarnation of that novice initiate so many years earlier and he has a global purpose!<br /><br />The Secret Mantra picks up where “The Magician”leaves off, Matt realizing he has an incredibly important mission, but there are forces that want to stop him. Through an exciting, multi-national chase by an evil billionaire with a god complex, Matt is tasked with keeping an ancient scroll safe while navigating the traps set by the billionaires henchmen.<br /><br />Layering Buddhist teachings throughout an incredibly fast paced thriller would be impossible for anyone else, but Michie’s own life is the foundation for his ability to write so seamlessly about these teachings and their impact on life.<br /><br />From The Dali Llama’s Cat (a delightful four part series about monastic life from the perspective of the highest and most revered Buddhist leader in the world’s cat) to all of his non-fiction teaching books, Michie is singularly the best author of Buddhist teachings as they apply to our modern, chaotic and highly attached lives.<br /><br />If you’re looking for an exciting escape that highlights the most powerful and transcendent philosophy, then start with The Magician of Lhasa (it really needs to be a movie, it’s what we need after 12 months of 2020) and keep reading right through The Secret Mantra, an indescribable escape, layered with hope, peace and intrigue!<br /><br />I’ve never been more enamored of an author and his ability to lift my heart into a space of page turning intrigue and heart opening hope! If you’ve felt undone in any way by the events of this (or any) year....start with these two books. You’ll be hooked and delighted!<br /><br />Then! Move onto the Dali Llama Cat series....you’ll be forever grateful you did, might even give you a deep seated hope for the future you didn’t know was possible!<br /><br />PS. It must be mentioned, Buddhism has nothing to do with religion, worship or conflict with Christian beliefs. It is a philosophy that offers guidance how we can all live better, more fulfilled lives by understanding and employing loving kindness and compassion.<br /><br />Two things that were in short supply this year globally.",5.0,1,2020
"Nice balance between personal stories, religion, science, the universe and our role in it","I enjoyed: “Until the End of Time …” and recommend that you purchase and read it. Greene’s book will be especially enjoyed by those interested in the universe and our role in it and for readers with some technical training; but, I must share though my opinion that if the author were half as smart and the book half as long it would have been twice as good. For the most part he strikes a nice balance between personal stories, religion and a physics-based, understanding of the universe; it is for the most part very understandable and entertaining  to read; there are some dry parts however. There is great intellectual depth, reference to well-known scientific terms… scholars… and their work and a plethora of end notes. To the author’s credit but to the detriment of the reader, the author clearly explains one point of view and the evidence supporting it but then the author presents another point of view with evidence and then yet another. Academic points were explained in a way understandable to most readers such that they would be drawn to read this book. He discusses the traditional view of the big bang that many scientists now belief was the start of the universe and juxtaposes that view with another newer alternative view… that it will oscillate between very small and very large and back again for an infinite duration. Some will find this fascinating; others too theoretical.<br /> Illustrative of the substance and style of the author, Greene writes: “Across cultures and through the ages, we have placed significant value on permanence. The ways we have done so are abundant: some seek absolute truth, others strive for enduring legacies, some build formidable monuments, others pursue immutable laws, and others still turn with fervor toward one or another version of the everlasting… Eternity, as these preoccupations demonstrate, has a powerful pull on the mind aware that its material duration is limited… We emerge from laws that, as far as we can tell, are timeless, and yet we exist for the briefest moment of time. We are guided by laws that operate without concern for destination, and yet we constantly ask ourselves where we are headed. We are shaped by laws that seem not to require an underlying rationale, and yet we persistently seek meaning and purpose.”<br /> Greene writes: “what’s certain is that a billion or so years after the earth formed it was teeming with life developing under evolutionary pressure, and so the next phase of developments is standard Darwinian fare. Chance events, like being hit by a cosmic ray or suffering a molecular mishap during the replication of DNA, result in random mutations, some with minimal impact on the organism’s health or welfare but others making it more or less fit in the competition for survival. Those mutations that enhance fitness are more likely to be passed on to descendants… From generation to generation, qualities that enhanced fitness thus spread widely.”<br /> Green writes: ” Over the course of many decades their research gradually led to an iconic result that has become justly famous: the second law of thermodynamics… In (highly) colloquial terms, the law declares that the production of waste is unavoidable… The law reveals (loosely, again) that everything in the universe has an overwhelming tendency to run down, to degrade, to wither… While history records the steam engine’s central role in the Industrial Revolution, the questions it raised for fundamental science were just as significant… In puzzling over these issues… Carnot launched the field of thermodynamics—the science of heat, energy, and work… his ideas would inspire scientists… to develop a radically new perspective”<br /> Greene writes: “the first law of thermodynamics ensures that the energy balance sheet will balance… The second law of thermodynamics focuses on entropy. Unlike the first law, the second is not a law of conservation. It is a law of growth. The second law declares that over time there is an overwhelming tendency of entropy to increase… In colloquial terms, special configurations tend to evolve toward ordinary ones order tends to descend into disorder (your organized garage degenerates into a haphazard mess of tools, storage boxes, and sporting equipment)… Bake bread and you can be sure that the aroma will shortly fill rooms far from the kitchen… The reason, is that there are many more ways for the aroma molecules to spread compared with ways for them to cluster.”<br /> Greene writes: “we are no closer to answering the question raised by Gottfried Leibniz… “Why is there something rather than nothing?”—than we were when the German philosopher first expressed this lean distillation of the mystery of existence… The fact that we can use mathematics to describe what we think took place nearly fourteen billion years ago, and from that successfully predict what powerful telescopes should now see, well, it is breathtaking. Sure, profound questions abound, like what or who created space and time, and what or who imposed the guiding grip of mathematics, and what or who is responsible for there being anything at all, but [still]  we’ve gained powerful insight into the cosmic unfolding.”<br /> Greene writes: “After all, the more finely you examine something that’s alive, the more challenging it is to see that it’s living… Seeking insight into life by homing in on fundamental particles is akin to experiencing a Beethoven symphony instrument by instrument, note by single note… Although we won’t answer the question of life’s origin (still a mystery), we will see that all life on earth can be traced to a common single-celled ancestral species, sharply delineating what a science of life’s origin will ultimately need to explain… Fred Hoyle … referred to the universe being created in “one big bang,” unwittingly coining one of science’s most pithy monikers… The Origin of the Solar System At just over four and a half billion years old, the sun is a cosmic newcomer… The first stars were likely mammoth, hundreds or perhaps even thousands of times the mass of the sun, burning with such intensity that they quickly died out. The heaviest ended their lives in a gravitational implosion so emphatic that they collapsed all the way down to black holes… some 4.7 billion years ago a supernova shock wave likely plowed through a cloud containing hydrogen, helium, and small quantities of more complex atoms, compressing part of the cloud, which, now being denser than its surroundings, exerted a stronger gravitational pull and thus began to draw material inward… The gravitational force squeezed the spherical core… Earth’s first half billion years are referred to as the Hadean period, invoking the Greek god of the underworld to connote an infernal era of raging volcanoes, gushing molten rock, and thick noxious fumes of sulfur and cyanide… Roughly fifty to one hundred million years after its birth, earth likely collided with a Mars-sized planet called Theia, which would have vaporized the earth’s crust, obliterated Theia, and blown a cloud of dust… into space. In time, that cloud would have clumped up gravitationally to form the moon”<br /> Greene writes: “all complex multicellular life descended from the same single-celled ancestral species. Cells are similar because their lineages radiate from the same starting point… the evidence strongly suggests that in seeking life’s origin, the lineages converge to a common ancestor… protein synthesis requires cellular software. And within every cell such instructions exist. They are encoded by DNA, the life-supporting chemical whose geometrical architecture was discovered by Watson and Crick… Every molecule of DNA is configured in the famous spiral of the double helix, a long twisting ladder whose rungs consist of pairs of struts, shorter molecules called bases, usually denoted A, T, G, and C… Members of a given species mostly share the same sequence of letters. For humans, the DNA sequence runs about three billion letters long, with your sequence differing from that of Albert Einstein or Marie Curie or William Shakespeare or anyone else by less than about a quarter of a percent, roughly one letter out of every string of five hundred… But while basking in the glow of possessing a genome so similar to that of any of history’s most revered luminaries (or infamous villains), note that your DNA sequence also has a percent overlap with any given chimpanzee’s.”<br /> Greene writes: “When I first learned about Darwinian evolution, my biology teacher presented the theory as if it were the clever solution to a brain teaser that, once understood, should elicit a gentle slap to the forehead and the exclamation “Why didn’t I think of that?” Darwin’s solution comes down to two connected ideas: First, when organisms reproduce, progeny are generally similar but not identical to their parents. Or, as Darwin put it, reproduction yields descent with modification. Second, in a world with finite resources, there’s competition for survival. Those biological modifications that enhance success in the competition increase the likelihood that the bearer will survive long enough to reproduce and thus pass on their survival-enhancing traits to future generations. Over time, different combinations of successful modifications slowly accumulate, driving an initial population to branch into groups that form distinct species… were Darwinian evolution not supported by data it would have failed to achieve scientific consensus… [Subsequently] Watson and Crick concluded their paper with… : “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.”… Watson and Crick revealed the process by which life duplicates the very molecules that store the cell’s internal instructions, allowing copies of the instructions to be passed on to progeny.”<br /> Greene writes: “Essential to evolution is that in the descent from parent to progeny, modifications to DNA are typically few in number. This stability protects genetic improvements built up over previous generations, ensuring that they are not rapidly degraded or wiped out.., copying errors creep in at the rate of roughly one per every one hundred million DNA base pairs. That’s like a medieval scribe getting a single letter wrong per every thirty copies of the Bible… Even such minimal genetic modification, when accumulated over a great many generations, can give rise to massive physical and physiological development. This is not obvious… Life has evolved for billions of years. That’s thousands of millions of years… evolution by natural selection is better described as innovation by trial and error.”<br /> About RNA, Greene writes: “Toward the Origins of Life Back in the 1960s, a number of prominent researchers… drew attention to a close cousin of DNA, called RNA (ribonucleic acid), which some four billion years ago may have jump-started a phase of molecular Darwinism that was the precursor to life… RNA is an extraordinarily versatile molecule that is an essential component of all living systems. You can think of it as a shorter, one-sided version of DNA, comprising a single rail along which a sequence of bases is attached. Among its various cellular roles, RNA is a chemical mediator that takes imprints of various small sections of an “unzipped” strand of DNA … Once molecules acquire the capacity to replicate, chance errors and mutations will feed molecular Darwinism, driving chemical concoctions along the all-important vector of increased fitness. Playing out over hundreds of millions of years, the process has the capacity to build the chemical architecture of life.”<br /> Greene writes: “Notwithstanding the apocryphal palindrome “Madam, I’m Adam,” no one knows when we began to speak or why. Darwin speculated that language emerged from song and imagined that those endowed with Elvis-like talents would more readily attract mates and thus more abundantly seed subsequent generations of gifted crooners… there is wide agreement that human language differs profoundly from any other variety of communication in the animal kingdom… As our hunter-gatherer forebears roamed the plains and forests, the capacity to communicate… was vital for effective group functioning and essential for sharing accumulated knowledge… the FOXP2 gene does appear to be one essential component for normal speech and language… For chimps, the protein encoded by their FOXP2 gene differs from ours by only two amino acids (out of more than seven hundred), while that of Neanderthals is identical to ours… As [some] also noted, it’s one thing to have the physical capability and mental agility to engage in conversation and quite another to actually do so.”<br /> Greene writes: “From the standpoint of natural selection, what matters is the impact this or that behavior would have had on the survival and reproductive prospects of our forebears during the bulk of their history… But recorded history provides information for only the final quarter of 1 percent of the roughly two million years stretching back to the earliest human migrations out of Africa… Faced with the potential of a devastating shortfall in caloric intake, a preference for foods densely packed with sugars has manifest adaptive value. If you were designing the human mind, aware of the human body’s physiological needs and the nature of the ancestral environment, it is easy to imagine that you would program the human brain to encourage its body to eat fruit whenever available. That natural selection arrived at this very strategy is thus not at all surprising..”<br /> Greene writes: “Rather than likening the brain to a general-purpose computer awaiting whatever programming it acquires through experience, the brain is likened to a special-purpose computer, hardwired with programming designed by natural selection to bolster the survival and reproductive prospects of our forebears… For groups of kin, an idea… suggests that evolution by natural selection solves the problem without breaking a sweat.  I’m loyal to my siblings, my children, and other close relatives because we share a meaningful portion of our genes… Religion is story, enhanced by doctrines, rituals, customs, symbols, art, and behavioral standards.”<br /> Greene writes: “A Sketch of Religious Roots During the first millennium BC, across India, China, and Judea, tenacious and inventive thinkers reexamined ancient myths and ways of being, entailing among other developments what philosopher Karl Jaspers described as the “beginnings of the world religions, by which human beings still live.”… Religious systems became increasingly organized as adherents set down stories, culled insights, and synthesized directives that, having been channeled through anointed prophets and passed orally from one generation to the next, they hold in common a fascination with the very questions guiding our exploration in these pages: Where did we come from? And where are we going?... Among the earliest surviving written records are the Vedas, composed in Sanskrit on the Indian subcontinent, with portions that date from as far back as 1500 BC… the Vedas… constitutes the sacred texts of what would become the Hindu religion—now practiced by one in seven inhabitants of the earth, about 1.1 billion people…  “When it comes to consciousness, Buddhism has something important to say… During roughly the same era that the Buddha was wandering in India, the Jewish people in the Kingdom of Judah were being… forced into exile… Jewish leaders gathered disparate written accounts and oversaw the transcription of oral histories, yielding early versions of the Hebrew Bible— The God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is the all-powerful, all-knowing, everywhere-present, singular creator of everything.”<br /> Greene writes: “The Urge to Believe explained that we are a species that looks upon the world and sees patterns… Over many generations, natural selection equipped us to identify patterns in how people and objects appear and move, allowing us to identify them rapidly with just a few visual cues… In short, the capacity for recognizing pattern is how we survive… Sometimes, our naturally selected pattern detectors are so primed, so ready to announce that a signal has been found, that they see patterns and envision correlations that are not there. Sometimes we assign meaning to the meaningless.”<br />Greene writes: “Ever since Edwin Hubble’s observations in the 1920s, we have known that space is expanding: the galaxies are rushing away from one another… Space is expanding, but the rate of expansion must be decreasing … [BUT] they discovered that the expansion is not slowing down. It is speeding up… the expansion has been picking up speed for the past five billion years.”<br /> About dark energy, Greene writes: “The case for dark energy is compelling but circumstantial… because it so adeptly accounts for the observations, dark energy has become the de facto explanation for the accelerated expansion of space… simplicity, while favored conceptually, has no fundamental claim on truth… The mathematical description of dark energy allows for it to weaken, putting the brakes on accelerated expansion, or strengthen, giving additional gas to accelerated expansion.”<br /> Greene writes: “if the universe is eternal, any duration, however long, registers as infinitesimal… Narrated from the perspective of these longer scales, the cosmological accounting would go like this: a moment after the big bang, life arose, briefly contemplated its existence within an indifferent cosmos, and dissolved away… To me, the future that science now envisions highlights how our moment of thought, our instant of light, is at once rare, wondrous, and precious.”<br /> Greene writes: “According to this theory, regions of space like ours go through phases of expansion followed by contraction, with the cycles repeating indefinitely. The big bang becomes the big bounce—a rebound from the previous period of contraction… during each cycle a given region of space stretches far more than it contracts, ensuring the entropy it contains is thoroughly diluted… The duration of each cycle is determined by the value of the dark energy which, based on today’s measurements, sets the duration on the order of hundreds of billions of years… Moreover, since the cycles might persist indefinitely into the past as well as the future, we would need to envision the structure extending infinitely far in both directions… cyclic cosmology has emerged as a main competitor to the inflationary theory… Of course, truth in science is… determined by experiments, observations, and evidence.”<br /> Greene writes: “We pursue meaning... “Earth is a pedestrian planet orbiting an unremarkable star in the suburbs of an ordinary galaxy. If we’re taken out by an asteroid, the universe won’t so much as blink. In the grand scheme of things, it just won’t matter… The doomsday scenario refined my thinking, making it patently evident that our equations and theorems and laws… are, after all, a collection of lines and squiggles drawn on blackboards and printed in journals and textbooks. Their value derives from those who understand and appreciate them. Their worth derives from the minds they inhabit.”",4.0,1,2020
"A garden is always a series of losses set against a few triumphs, like life itself. ~ May Sarton","Who knew Mrs. Bennet was an avid gardener, knowledgeable in all aspects of growing green things?<br /><br />What a very good thing for Mrs. Bennet in her greatest loss:  the death of her husband.<br /><br />Jane is married to Bingley as the story begins and Mr. Bennet has died unexpectedly.

Good mystery of who committed those murders but slightly confusing,"Natalie Peters fifteen and her young sister Lindsey eight are running for their lives.  An underground organization helps them escape and assume new identifies.  Years later Lindsey, now known as Jane Smith, learns Natalie and Jennifer, the lady who was instrumental in their escape, have been killed.  Mummified bodies are discovered and it shocks Jane to learn one of the bodies is identified as her, with the name she abandoned 25 years ago when she went into hiding.  Jane has trained in martial arts for protecting herself from those she is convinced are still out to kill her.  The question is why when Natalie never told her why they had to run?<br />  Detective Harriet Harper works cold cases so becomes part of the task force to bring justice for the dead girls just discovered.  This is personal to Harri since her own sister was killed and that is still an open case.  A witness then comes forward which Harri is reluctant to believe at first.  It then becomes obvious Lindsey was NOT one of the two unidentified bodies because she was not the right age when the girls had died.  The killer then plays a cat and mouse game with Harri.  Jane Smith wants her life back so takes avenues to help Harri get closer to determining who the killer is.<br />  This book is told from the views of Lindsey Peters and Detective Harper.  While strong and driven, both have their own traumatic issues to deal with.  I personally found the book hard to follow at times.  It may have been due to different cases trying to be connected to another, remembering who was who, or one person running into another person’s dialogue.  There were times I had to go back and reread paragraphs for that reason and the book needed better editing.  Hence, the reason for four stars.  The storyline had many twists and turns to keep you involved in trying to solve the murders.  At the end, things are summed up for the cases that are being worked.",4.0,1,2020

When hit by bullets, aircraft engines didn't emit ""black contrails"", but black smoke. The word ""contrail"" is short for ""condensation trail"".

Outstanding!,"I’ve been a big fan of Diamond & Silk’s since I first saw them on Facebook. Then I saw the notice that said they’d been banned from Facebook which is normal for conservative voices, especially black voices. Happily I found them again on Twitter and saw that they’d written a book.<br /><br />The book is well-written and thoroughly engaging. The first 30 pages or so, give the background of these amazing ladies, with their preacher parents, and how they learned about small businesses through their parents laundry business, and working in a factory that made the cloth. All of this set them up to understand what was happening in our country with NAFTA As the ladies saw jobs leaving for China and factories closing, along with illegals coming into to take the jobs that were left, for less money.<br />D & S heard Trump speak and the rest is history.<br />These determined ladies, started a movement to elect the man they felt would finally free the country of the stranglehold of the Left who seemed determined to gut our manufacturing, weaken our military, keep us divided by race and flood us with illegal immigrants until America finally fell.<br />D & S started with videos until they had a gathering of of Americans who were also seeing the light, until Melania Trump noticed them and introduced them to her husband.<br />What I found so inspiring about this book, is how these ladies built an empire out of their values, and despite being belittled by so many of their own race for, as the ladies put it ‘daring to have an opinion that wasn’t from the Left’, they preserved and are now famous.<br />They were even invited to congress to testify about their banning from Facebook, while Zuckerberg was  testifying. What I found shocking, was the Maxine Waters was one of the rudest to D & S, pretending she didn’t understand the dates of when Facebook canceled Diamond & Silk. I was stunned that for all their talk about lifting up the black people, the people in power(Dems) seemed determined to keep a successful pair of women down.<br />Shameful.<br />This book is not only inspiring, but also gives so much good information on just exactly how the black populace is being ‘kept on the plantation’ with lies, liquor stores, drugs and abortion clinics, that it’s worth reading for anyone who wants to know what’s really going on.<br />Well done, ladies and keep up the good work.",5.0,1,2020
This could have been great,"#1 issues- NOT SAFE<br />I really enjoyed many parts of this story but the author did the unforgivable around 80 % of the book the author has the hero fake due and they separate for 5 years. The heroine was already the promiscuous type (the book opted with her obsessing about finding someone to sleep with l. She almost cheats on the hero midway through the book but he shows up. So of course after the separation she is sleeping with other people. When he shows back up she is in an actual relationship. We find out he is married. When he relocated he was forced to marry. They talk about her a couple of times. It never says that they weren’t intimate, so we have to assume he was. I may try this author again, I don’t know. I’d love to know she can write a story where the characters prove they love each other with loyalty, and not immediately ready to jump in bed with someone else. I can’t really count this as an HEA.

Well written but unsympathetic characters,"This was as close as I've come to DNFing any of the historical romances I've read. Not because it wasn't well written, because it WAS. In fact, it was well plotted, the characters well developed. But that's the problem, the characters. I like strong women and men who are rakes.  I do not like men who are cruel or stupid. Neither do I like women who only find strength in hitting their husbands, but no strength anywhere else.<br /><br />Frankly, I was ready to toss them both out a window and move onto another books, but I persevered. Unfortunately, even with the ending, I still disliked them. Neither the H or h held any redeeming qualities, in my opinion.  I've given it 3 stars because of the writing talent the author has, but I can't do any better than that.",3.0,0,2020

Maybe my mother raised strong women but I would never have allowed some drunk jerk to humiliate me like that.

A delightful visit with the past.,"I've been reading science fiction for over 50 years now and my childhood (I was in 3rd grade when I fell in love with the genre) was immeasurably enriched by it. I read many of Clifford D. Simak's stories and books years ago. I don't recall having read these however. Sitting here in 2020 AD, these stories have a quaint character to them. The language and its use has changed quite a bit since the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. Maybe not as much since the 60s, although that could be my own bias.<br /><br />Each of these stories is worthwhile. Not a clunker among them. There are some rather antiquated ideas, a fair amount of unconscious sexism where women are mostly background accessories and men do the important things, and then there are the robots. Their dialogue is pretty much what you'd expect from humans of the time, except for the robots in one of the stories. These are not Asimov's robots by any means. But they do provide another perspective and sometimes comic relief. I'm not getting into all the social issues and what robots might be representing here. But suffice it to say they seem a lot like the servants, porters, cooks, and menials played in Hollywood movies by many African Americans in movies of that era. There was one racist comment that I noticed but in those days no white person would have had any problem with it. So our perspective has changed since the days when Simak was writing. He is a product of his time as are his stories. If we look at it from this perspective, then the stories can be enjoyable and also provide a look into the mindset of e day gone by.",5.0,1,2020
Read the reviews of the individual books.,"The omnibus was a nice reset to reviews. If you want a thorough look, I'd encourage you to look at the individual books. I got around 69% of the way through this, so I'm nearing the end of book three. Book one was pretty incredible. Great action and development. Some great ideas were implemented and the gender bender was actually a curious switch that I was excited to see explored. However, as many of the other reviewers note, the books start to go downhill in 2 and 3. There's a much greater focus on the relationships, which really starts to feel like a massive harem. I found myself beginning to skip multiple pages at a time as the ""passionate"" scenes came up. Moving on, the kingdom building was again very interesting at first, but becomes a near series of constant updates of traveling to each location. It almost feels like the the author was trying to meet a word count. Development of skills is dropped as no longer a priority, and most of the skills feel as if they were used once or twice, and never again. A massive character sheet is built, with only a small portion of it being relevant. Unfortunately, it does feel like the litrpg aspect of the book has been nearly completely dropped. With the length of this book, I can't continue and hope it turns around.",2.0,0,2020

An action-packed start to a promising new series!,"As a fan of Mr. Scott’s writing, I’ve read and enjoyed about 15 of his books, and have never been disappointed.  The stories are always well-planned, with strong characters, lots of action and vivid descriptions which make me feel like I’m immersed in a movie.<br /><br />This is an exciting start to what promises to be another great series.  Cade Korbin has a checkered past, from which he chose a path to pursue and take down bad guys under contract, but he follows his own code.  He’s not a Boy Scout, but rather, an outlaw with a soft spot in his heart (or in his head?), which leads to some interesting tight situations.  This story has non-stop action, with several twists that leave you wondering what is true and who you can trust.  How can Cade succeed despite long odds against him?  The ending is a surprise I didn’t see coming.  This tale is tied up nicely without a cliff-hanger, and leaves several options open for continuing stories.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I received an ARC – this review is my honest opinion.  I purchased a copy on release to support this great writer.  Do yourself a favor and read this book – you will enjoy it!",5.0,1,2020
"Despite a confusing first half, it's worth the slog","(minor) SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />I only got into 40k in the last 18 months but I've dived into the lore as quickly as my bank account coiuld afford to keep enriching GW and this was probably the most satisfying book I've read in all that time.<br /><br />The beginning was honestly a bit of a chore.  I actually wondered if my kindle had downloaded the wrong book- more than once.  I didn't see the connections to the former trilogies until a looong way into the story, and I was worried that I'd downloaded some 40k/Hogwarts collab/abomination.  But eventually, things do start to fall into place and we get a better idea of who's who in our girls life, as well as clues to tell us who's really who!<br /><br />The main plot is heartbreaking.  This being 40k, that isn't exactly uncovered ground, but I usually don't feel as sad to see my characters at odds like I did in this novel.  When a squad gets massacred by 'nids or one of a group becomes corrupted by chaos and kills all his friends, it's sad but that's just the nature of bolter porn.  I was NOT expecting the very different type of betrayal that we saw in Pariah.  It works, and I don't think I've been this excited for a sequel in over a decade.  And the ending... god damn was the ending satisfying!<br /><br />This ones tough to start but once you've cleared the first hurdle, it's nonstop excitement that was absolutely amazing. This is one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for any fan.<br /><br />**And given that Eisenhorn's getting a live action show soon and we'll likely have a lot of 40k newbies hearing about the universe, I want to make sure that I mention that this should be read AFTER the Eisenhorn and Ravenor trilogies.",5.0,1,2020

Frustrating,"I’m actually surprised that I finished this book. I’ve read and enjoyed a lot of the authors previous stories, but I think this one didn’t quite work. I liked Bull and his friends, even Sandra. I didn’t like Sky and pretty much the way she handled anything, especially Bull revealing his secret. The pacing of the story seemed slow too, but that could be because of the other content.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me most was the social issues. Dragging on for pages about it again and again made it feel like the author was trying to force those things to the forefront of the book, making her thoughts on it more important than the story she was telling.

Don't Let the Cute Dog on the Cover Mislead You,"I have read the author's other novels and loved each of them. This one, not so much. Even though the protagonist is a vet, the cover of this book is misleading - don't put a cute dog on the cover of a novel that deals with serious family pathos. Yes, there are dogs in the story, but this is not a book about pets. I understand the title as a play on words now that I've finished the novel, but I think it adds to the misperception as to what this novel is about. I'm a family therapist by training, and I found the plot line convoluted and at the end, simply not believable. Without giving away any plot points, the resolutions just didn't ring true.

This is really a short story....,"This is the 100th book by Diana Palmer on my Kindle.  I am beginning to tire of h's who have some debilitating illness and page after page of descriptions of the illness and possible treatments and how brave the h is in enduring it.  In addition, this book has so many descriptions of the past actions and history of the secondary characters that I began to suspect it was all filler to puff up the number of pages.  That said, there are gaps in what is presented:  Why is Barbara dating Fred Baldwin when at the end of  True Blue she is interested in General Cassaway, her son's father-in-law?  We are told  the story of why her cook came to work for her is a ""hoot"", but not told what that story is.

Exceptional Writing!,"I've been following these writers for a while and I seriously love their style and the amazing characters and dialogue they create. But this story is absolutely the best one so far! Non formulaic, amazing action, gorgeous and detailed love scenes, and the DIALOGUE!!! So, in some (most) romance books, there's a sort of formula where you know there will be a point where one of the main characters does the stupid thing that breaks them apart and then there's the dramatic struggle of reuniting. Trying not to give any spoilers here, but, again, non formulaic. The action is so well described without bogging down the flow. Every word is valuable and necessary for this moment we get to be a part of. Seriously excellent action. Love scenes are absolutely perfect. The language used is sexy without being crude. Gives you all the feels. But, people...THE DIALOGUE!!!! The way these characters talk and think is so absolutely unique and feels totally real and original that I literally reread pages several times just to absorb and enjoy their words. Made me laugh out loud, made me cry and press my chest with that horrid longing we all get when the relationship is so perfect and we have to face the dishes instead of that amazing hero at the end of the day. Damn. Seriously. Buy the whole series and plop yourself down at the edge of your seat with me while we wait for the next book to be published. Commence the countdown...",5.0,1,2020
Good read,I really enjoyed this story even the fact it was geared towards the young adult population.  It takes two young people - brother and sister - thru adventure after adventure.  First experiencing unusual happenings that the sister was able to make happen and both freaking out trying to figure out what was happening to them to watching their parents killed by the police and CIA guys and running and hiding from them to a road trip across country with a friend of their mother and finally an epic battle for earth between two different aliens- one trying to save earth and one trying to destroy it.,5.0,1,2020
Ok,Charge was an ok read for me. I didn't love Charge at all which rarely happens because he spent a lot of the beginning whining like a child about his ex. The author tried to present him as laid back but to me he was an immature wimp. Kayla although 21 felt a lot younger than that and while I do believe it was mostly due to what happened to her and how her stepmother and father dealt with it. I do wish she had confronted them about the past but I guess it wasn't the right time. The relationship and intimate scenes between Charge and Kayla were lukewarm and not at all interesting. For me the best part of the book was Jimmy and Boots. At this time I have no plans to continue this series.,2.0,0,2020

Good writing with a fatal flaw!,"He could be a good author, but he has a major fetish for brutal kidnap/rape themes.

I quit right there in the middle of the book. There's something wrong with this man (and maybe some of his readers who made him a best-selling author). Think about it, dear reader, and make a conscious decision about whether you want to encourage this kind of ""literature."" It took a long time to get those nightmare images out of my mind, so John Jakes is not getting another dollar from me or another opportunity to make me sick.

The Glamourist,"The Glamourist is the second book in the Vine Witch series.  While it could possibly be read as a stand-alone, I really wouldn't recommend it.  There's backstory and other things to be found in the first book (and honestly the first book was so good its what made me want to read this whole series).<br /><br />This book is Yvette's story.  The flighty, bright girl who Elena encountered in the first book.  While Elena has problems of her own, she can't help but sympathize with Yvette's troubles and want to help her.  But everyone wants Yvette or to see her gone, and there's some magical undercurrent about Yvette that she doesn't understand herself.<br /><br />I am not as fond of Yvette as a character as I was Elena.  Elena was a bit more solid, not as flighty or dramatic and I think I empathized more with that.  Yvette is dramatic, and bold, and takes risks she probably shouldn't.  And that may appeal to some people, but honestly, it's what had me going back and forth in this book.  I wanted more Elena and was a bit sad she had to share the book with Yvette.<br /><br />In terms of storyline, it had an interesting ending.  Not sure I liked how it turned out, but it definitely worked with the issues and premise that was built up to.  But seemed almost kind of an easy way out.  I did like the introduction of side characters, like a certain shop owner and Elena's future mother-in-law.  They added some excitement and intrigue all their own.<br /><br />This was a solid second book in the series.  While I may not have enjoyed it quite as much as the first, I still very much look forward to reading more in the series.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2020",4.0,1,2020
Not a fan of where the series is going,"I've been reading Dresden Files since the beginning.  Long time fan.  I miss the earlier books.  I can't put my finger on what's changed, but something is different.  Dresden is quippier.  Every third sentence is hell's bells something or other.  Characters act out of character.  Murphy is twisting the plot awfully close to a poorly written paranormal romance.<br /><br />This one was a b struggle to get through, especially considering the long wait between books.

Disappointing,"Let me start by saying I'm a big Harlan fan - as a KU subscriber I don't fork over this kind of $$ for just any author, they've got to be one of my faves.  I love Harlan's witty, quick writing style and (usually) I can never figure out how all the story lines are going to tie together but know that somehow he'll answer all my questions at the end and it will all make sense.  Not so much in this one.  (Ok, this could be a spoiler I guess so go forward at your own risk....)  So let me just ask - why did we never find out how Wilde ended up in the woods as a kid?  I mean, really?  That's the title of the book, for #$%'s sake.  The was perhaps the most interesting part of this whole story and we never got any answers on that.  I couldn't believe the book was over and we had no answers other than a potential distant relative that may or may not be able to give some insight on his background.  Really?  It was like Harlan couldn't figure out how to land the plane so he just crashed it into a mountain and called it ""the end"".

Overall good book. Recommend.,"I enjoyed this book and will buy the next one.  In general I felt that it was very well written and kept my interest throughout.  Why did I just give it 4 stars?  There were parts that were just not believable.  For example,  the majority of couples in this book experienced love at first sight.  Now I believe in soul mates and for them love at first sight.  It happens but those instances are few and very far between.  Not in this book. It was the norm.  There were also coincidences, particularly with people meeting, that were possible but unlikely.  These things took something away from an otherwise well written book.  Like I said,  I enjoyed it and am getting ready to read the next one.

Nope... just skip this one.,"This book was a hot mess.  There was NO depth to the characters, the sex scenes were frankly so bad and frequent that I skimmed through most of them.  The hero was sleazy, the heroine was unlikable, there was nothing about them that made me care about them at all.  If I had to read one more time about how HUGE he was I might have thrown my Kindle across the room.  The two best friends were the only thing that SLIGHTLY redeemed any part of this story (SLIGHTLY).  These characters are supposed to be grown ups, but I felt like I was reading about a really bad frat party.  Some of the scenes were actually uncomfortable to read.  And the ending... really!  They've known each other a minute and a half and he proposes after epic fights, misunderstandings, lying.... sigh.  This is actually the first book I've read by this author, and I'll be honest I don't know that I would read another.

hero has the depth of a horny teen,"I felt like both characters were really two dimensional. Neither one had much of a personality, or did much changing throughout the book. There just wasn't much to them. I think the author tried to create a bit of backstory for the Hero, but it was just one little flashback, so instead of adding to the depth of the character, it actually just seemed random and disconnected.  Also, and this is the part that really bothered me, the Hero marries this girl, and is like, ""ooh, she's really attractive, I wish she would have sex with me"". And then has basically no different thought about her throughout the book.  Just a dude moping about how the pretty girl doesn't want to hop in bed with him, and trying to convince her its a great idea. It honestly felt like I was in high school again and all any boy could think about was sex. I gave it two stars instead of just one because there were a few moments of romantic tension that were kind of fun.",2.0,0,2020

An excellent new series,"Fresh off the author’s success with her first series The Kaylid Cornicles is another example of superb world building.  Here is an alternate world with Magic as a partially understood effect that happens to some 50% of the population.

The sapling that survives the storm becomes stronger, and Cori becomes steel in her determination to succeed.<br /><br />Strong character building helps the story along greatly, but Cori needs a serious Clue Bat up-side the head.

She of course can’t do it alone so she hires River who is not only perfect for for the company but perfect for her.<br /><br />Third person point of view threw me off at first as I’m not used to reading these types. Took me a good chapter to get into the flow but the story makes up for it 😊.<br /><br /> I completely fell in love with River. His personality was way too addictive to not love. He’s not your typical cocky man but sweet, sometimes vulnerable and a completely loyal tall dark and handsome man.<br />Georgie is successful, confident and has a good head on her shoulders. Both with past emotional baggage due to their parents.<br />You get to see if they get past their fears and give in to each other. I couldn’t avoid having my heart melt for them.<br /><br />I just loved the growing relationships and quirky personalities in this story. Between the differences with the Buchanan siblings, the employees, crazy Aunt Dottie and the evil cat, this is constant entertainment and laughs.<br /><br />Now I’m stuck here waiting for the next one to release and I can’t wait!<br />No cliffhanger but this will surely make you have a strong attachment that you want to see their stories continue.<br />You won’t regret picking up Any Luck at All, you don’t need luck to fall in love with the people of Asheville Brewery! ❤️",5.0,1,2020

Great coming-of-age story,"Sariah Wilson has done it again! This book has all the elements of a truly wonderful romance.<br /><br />Bash and Ember began dating in high school. Then Bash's dad married Ember's mom, making them step-brother and -sister. Neither parent knew that they had been dating and Bash's dad warned him about getting involved with his step-sister. Thus, the plot has set the stage for heartbreak. Jump forward 2 years and Bash and Ember are attending the same college. Feelings are reawakened causing a dilemma regarding their blended family.<br /><br />This is a great coming-of-age story. There is angst that goes with young love; there is the matter of not wanting to disappoint one's parents; lessons involved in learning to forgive; and above all, being true to one's self. Just A Boyfriend is a fully developed story with fabulous characters and the HEA ending. This is a book that I will enjoy reading again! 5 stars.",5.0,1,2020
Disjointed,"3 stars because I actually finished the book but it is not a smooth read. It is apparent that most parts are a ""cut and paste"" of the original work and just dropped into new situations that just do not make much sense. For example when Caroline is asking Darcy how tall Georgiana is, Darcy claims she is about as tall as Ms Elizabeth Bennet. Never mind the fact that Elizabeth Bennet is Mrs. Hamilton. And later in the story after ODC are engaged we get the ball scene where ODC are dancing and they have the angry conversation where Elizabeth is trying to make out Darcy's character because she hears so many different stories and she just can't make it out. Um. They are engaged. I hope by this point she knows his character. These are just a couple of scenes but the entire book follows the same theme with added poor editing and a misuse of words such as ""sight"" instead of ""site"".<br /><br />If you have kindle unlimited and are looking for a new variation then I'd say parts are entertaining but I doubt I'll reread.",3.0,0,2020

Fast read,"Okay first the good part. The book is a very fast read, I finished if in about two hours start to finish as a page a minute reader. The concept is fine as my own short story Lost Submariners Log https://smile.amazon.com/Lost-Submariner-Log-Allen-McDonnell-ebook/dp/B00A9WGKEO/ will attest I like the basic concept.<br />On the other side of the scales there are some technical problems that just nag, like the Captain and crew first accepting they have moved through time so easily, then jumping right into a fleet action requiring them to travel at high speed for days, fight, then retreat while still having useable weapons. If I bite the bullet and accept the crew are all predisposed to believe they have been sent through time I can cross the first hurdle, but eagerly seeking battle with the Japanese who have been American allies for at least 75 years when this novel opens which is longer than the lifespan of any officer or crewman on the sub is a big jump.  These are Americans who grew up with cars from Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi, and electronics from Sony and Toshiba.  Blithely sailing half way across the Pacific without orders to attack a Japanese fleet is not the natural first reaction people with this life history would reflexively have. Now if the submarine in the story was the USS Nautilus from 1955 that would be a reasonable reaction as most of the officers and petty officers would have fought in WW II or Korea.  By using a submarine from 2025 the generation who would reflexively fight Japanese navy ships without considerable time to get used to the idea and explicit orders to do so is just a step too far for me. You could certainly get them to take the war seriously and fight the Japanese, but you need time to build up to the war.<br />On the technical side, modern attack subs, heck even WW II subs carried more torpedoes than the sub portrayed. In addition to more torpedoes modern subs also carry Harpoon anti-ship missiles that would be death on a destroyer size warship of the era which were tiny by modern standards and easily sunk. Also the Tomahawk VLS missiles have both land attack and anti-ship modes. No matter how good your aim a single 1000lbs explosion is going to do very limited damage to a military base.  The radius of damage unless you hit the ammo dump or a 10,000 barrel fuel oil tank is only enough to take out one or two buildings. Yes it can cause damage, but not a lot of damage and certainly not enough to close down a harbor shut down operations for more than a handful of days.<br />I don't want the author to feel overly picked on here, but I think a much expanded novel where things develop at a more realistic pace would make a fine third edition. I was taught that when writing Sci-Fi you should choose one fantastic technology or event, like getting dropped through time or inventing a camera that takes pictures of tomorrows newspaper headlines  or whatever you fancy. Then from that point on you try and make solid seeming characters that react to whatever premise you are using the same way your brother or next door neighbor might react in that situation.  If your characters react the same way your neighbor or cousin or local mayor would possibly react then your story has a realism about it that makes the fantastic difference seem more believable.",3.0,0,2020
Truly COMPLETE Collection,"I have two ""complete collection"" editions of Holmes adventures BUT this one is by far the most complete. I had no idea how many stories were written by Doyle! I began my reading February 9th and just completed my joy ride on April 14th! Perhaps I am a very slow 89 year old reader; however, I made an effort to read at least 4 stories every week. Never once was I bored. The most challenging part of my read was the unique vocabulary present in the 1850's. Thank God for Kindle's built in dictionary! The reader will be pleased to know there were few typos to distract one's attention to the plot.<br /><br />I had never read Holmes so this was a complete joy to me. Now I want to seek out the biography of the author!

2.5 stars,"For someone who had never read a CK book this would be a little higher. For me, as someone who has read many if not all of them I just can’t. It’s the same story that she’s already told there is nothing new in this book. She has told it sooo many times! I wish she’d have just switched out some of the things to make it work. Or if she’s going to rewrite the same book over and over focus on the good stuff. I stead see her her repeating the pattern of manhoe older guy has watched wanted this slightly younger girl for years, while he is screwing everyone who walks while she looks on. Suddenly she’s 18 and he’s ready to It’s not something he acknowledges or apologizes for ever. This is magical fantasy land where a guy can do all of that but the girl just accepts it and believes that he suddenly loves her and won’t cheat. He has basically been obsessed with one night stands, but can stop whenever he wants. Ok then why didn’t he do it already when he had feelings for the heroine (insert eyeroll)? The only drama is the manifested drama of the guys thinking dumping the girl is the best choice, because he’s not good enough. I’m not even kidding this is the plot to at least three of her books. I could post this exact review for all of them because they are that alike. For something different she could have had him, oh I don’t know... maybe not be a disgusting hoe left and right in front of the heroine... It’s not sexy.",2.0,0,2020
"Heroine was dishonest, selfish, lacking integrity, and just awful","I have enjoyed a couple other books by this author so decided to try this one. I found it very disappointing. Alice is one of the most unlikeable heroines I’ve ever tried to read about. I almost stopped reading several times but pressed on, hoping she would get better. Each time, she only got worse.<br /><br />She lies repeatedly. Behaves selfishly. Is terribly hypocritical. She lashes out at Thomas’s assertion that women are critical when that was all she had been to him. Sge even goes as far as to take his money offered in good faith to the Ace of Hearts, and give him purposely outlandish and bad advice that she literally laughs at while writing it—no integrity! She judges and criticizes him with no mercy yet has nothing but excuses for herself. A few token moments of feeling guilt, but none led her to change her behavior. Just more blaming and excuses. She was awful and I found myself wishing for a different outcome to spare Thomas Herring!",2.0,0,2020
Beautiful yet filled with mystery and angst. Nail-biting cliff hanger as well but book 2 coming soon,"This story from Mariah Dietz has been worth the wait! The characters are so incredible, some so enticing and heartwarming while others give you reason to mistrust and just love to hate. Raegan, the all American Girl knows what she wants in life and has no qualms of going for it, full steam ahead, even at the price of her heart. Of course she had to fall for her brother's best friend and well he is off limits.<br />Now I know this all seems like an average romance but do not be deceived. Mariah has presented us with the first book in this astounding duet and what she does with your heart and anxiety is truly breathtaking. It caused me to remain awake well into the night hoping to get some relief but alas she leaves you with tears in your eyes and your heart in your hands.<br />If you need me for any more information about Bending the Rules, you will find me curled up in the corner with my kindle waiting for Breaking the Rules to be released so that I may put my life back together and hopefully find some closure for these characters.",5.0,1,2020
Someone needed an editor to tell the author to rewrite the ending,"This book was fun, interesting, had some interesting characters, etc.  Overall, if I was writing about the first 80% of the book it was mid 4 star.<br /><br />But the ending is almost a 1 star for me.  Its bad.  Its very, very bad.  Things happen not because they make sense, but because the author wanted to setup a major subversion of expectations.  And that is clear with how he wrote the ending.<br /><br />The funny thing is that i'm reminded of a story I found on the web years ago, which had a similar ""we found a spaceship"" motif.  That one ends with the main character away from Earth trying to set up a new base as an Earth based government nukes his current base because ""if we can't have the tech, no one can"".  It upset me then as was a very anticlimactic ending.  The one here may actually be worse in some ways.<br /><br />Its not a bad read, but the ending really was off-putting for me so I give it a low 3 star.",3.0,0,2020
Edited: Review of first 10 books.  I quit.,"Original: Good world building, interesting mythology, well developed characters you care about.  A lot of content, a lot of well described action, nice character growth.  The translation from German is perhaps a bit clunky, but rather than being a bad thing, I just chose to look at it as ""that's just peculiarities of speech unique to the story universe,"" and didn't let it kick me out of my suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />I want to point out that this is not a trilogy.  There's pace and progress towards each book's goal, but the pace and progress toward the overarching goal is glacial.  At this pace, there could be ten more books, and I really hope he has enough ideas to stretch the series to that kind of goal.  So good, so far, but I expect it will be another decade before this all gets finished.  I'll check back in another five years and see what kind of progress has been made.<br /><br />Edit:  I read through book ten, then quit.  Each book ends up being very ""one note.""  He gets and idea, and beats it to death.  It's trope'y as hell.  There's a book on pirates with pretty much comical pirate booty language, chuckleworthy.  The book based on Native Plains Americans, less chuckleworthy.  It's formulaic, with the setting changing.  Forest, mountain, desert, empire, ocean, swamp, etc.  I've seen this in other books, and it reeks of desperation.  Let's put the characters in another setting and go over the same jokes and interactions.  One world reveal per book, one emotional problem per book.  It's become tedious.  I should have quit a few books ago when I found myself skimming after predicting when and how each bit would be resolved.  Bleh.",2.0,0,2020
Doug Phillips has become my favorite author,"When it was announced that Doug would be coming out with a new book, this time not about space fiction, I preordered it without even thinking twice because I had just finished another author's book and was so disenchanted with the writing stye after reading the Quantum series, I began reading it again because I couldn't find another author as appealing to me. I knew this book would arrive in my Kindle while I was in the middle of a 30 day vacation and thought I might have the time to read part of it before returning home. I was wrong. This book is such a page  turner, I finished it in three days instead of making it last the entire vacation. Now, I'll go back to the Quantum series..<br /><br />Phenomena is Doug's venture into a different kind of science fiction, that being neuroscience. As with his other books, he researches his subject quite extensively and blends fact with fiction in a writing style so well tuned, it becomes difficult to know what is real and what is not. Doug's character development, storyline development, attention to detail, and enormously vivid imagination blend into a writing style that I absorb completely. Fortunately for the reader less informed than he about his written subject, he explains in detail at the end of the book what is real and what is not.<br /><br />I will not dive into the plot or storyline since others before me already have. I will take offense with the reviewer that gave one star that didn't read more than 50 pages. He had no ability or reason to provide a review. And the neuroscientist that gave the three star review disliked it because it wasn't completely real. Well, that's why they call it fiction. In my opinion, this book deserves a five star review and is every bit as good as his Quantum series with its only fault being that it is shorter in length.<br /><br />Perhaps Doug would be interested in writing a sequel to this. His character development of the protagonist was excellent and makes the reader want to know more. Whether it is a sequel to this book or another in a new vein of fiction, I anxiously await his next work.",5.0,1,2020

"A different perspective of how the world turns, in an exciting fictional framework.","Purchased this almost the day it was available as I have been waiting for the continuation of Mr. Knights further adventures.  This is a book for the discriminating reader.  If you are looking for fluff, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for hard hitting facts, dealing with modern day issues in an exciting fictional format, this is the book for you.  If you have not read book 1 and 2, I recommend them first.  1 starts a bit slow but is needed to understand the story.  2 kicks off immediately and is hard to put down, and 3 continues the story in a very politically incorrect framework that will have you questioning the history you think you know and make you want to research things you took for granted.",5.0,1,2020
Too political.,"I enjoyed the first two books in this series. Unfortunately, the author chose to draw upon tiresome political caricatures for the antagonist and President.

Sadly, this will be the last Lee Goldberg book I will read as a result.<br /><br />I've never understood why any company, writer, or entertainer hoping for broad market appeal, would ever expose their political leanings.

Waste of time,"Oh my gosh, the angst was off the charts.  The whole cast of characters was absolutely saturated in it! I could see the main character since he had ample reason for his distress, but everyone? Nah.  And I guess the trend of young authors continues wherein the female lead treats the males like dirt, and it's not only acceptable but makes her loved even more truly, madly, and yes, deeply. Who'd have guessed that this is a desireable trait? I certainly didn't! If you like bad YA, look no further; if quality YA is more to your taste, you might want to skip it.",2.0,0,2020
Too sugar sweet for me,"I really like sci-fi romances especially with the whole mail order bride elements to it, this was a tad different since it’s more like an intergalactic Match.com dating service, but I was excited nevertheless.<br />One of my biggest issues is the whole insta-love thing, I really kind of hate that in books. Although it didn’t bug me with Darak because he is an alien and apparently he recognizes his mate immediately, so I can buy into that. But Lexi is a human, and she wasn’t exactly on board with the exception of thinking that he was hot, but once she brought him to her moms as a wedding date it seemed like suddenly she was so into him, being super emotionally vulnerable to him, and even late night skinny dipping where her family could see, it just didn’t exactly read authentic to her already established character.<br />The book was also really short for me, and because of that the characters never really get fleshed out. What is there in the book though is very sugar sweet, too much for me. I’m sure this is someone’s cup of tea, it’s just not mine.",2.0,0,2020
Strap Yourself In,"OMG! Ryan Green really bought Earle Leonard Nelson to life - and how horrifying a true crime tale it is. Earle was a full fledged Monster. What he lacked in intelligence he made up in criminal cunning. Despite the abuse he suffered he was also shown compassion by family and many around him, even though he didn't deserve it once his true colors of blood red were revealed, still he continued to receive it.<br /><br />Several years ago I read a brief summary about Nelson's crimes, but it was Ryan Green who reveals the true brutality of Earle's actions. The butchery and depravity he inflicted on his many victims was hard to stomach. Though horrific without the descriptive pictures painted by the author, the reader wouldn't have gotten the true view of the vileness that was actually perpetrated on these defenseless victims.<br /><br />From the beginning emphasis was placed on the size of Nelson's hands and the tremendous strength he possessed. It became more terrible to learn how he used his brute force in the cruelest manners possible with no empathy for the frail, elderly, smaller women he targeted. Just rape and strangulation were not depraved enough for Earle. He had to go there... near decapitation and necrophilia. He didn't just want his poor victims helpless, he wanted them lifeless. Then he had total control to play out all his horrid fantasies.<br /><br />I mostly listened to this book, hearing about Nelson's traversing initially throughout California, then the West Coast committing his grisly crimes was bad enough. But when he began moving to other cities / states I was so angry that despite so much publicity including various photos, names, and aliases he could not be caught. Then as I pulled into my dark backyard after work I hear to my horror that Nelson made it all the way to Buffalo. WAIT! WHAT?!<br />Before he continued to Canada. I had to quit reading for awhile. That he stayed in and killed in Buffalo was a very unexpected shock.😮😲😱<br /><br />This book exceeded my expectations by miles. If you are squeamish or faint of heart do not read this book. If you are a true crime aficionado READ IT! I highly recommend it and I guarantee you will not be disappointed - angry, disgusted certainly, but you'll see our worse serial killers had a nearly forgotten predecessor whose name is Earle Leonard Nelson. Thanks for a great and terrifying reading experience Ryan Green, with an added bonus of nightmares. I'll never feel the same when I see a Room(s) For Rent sign.",5.0,1,2020
Average,"If you’re looking for a novel with some degree of period authenticity, this isn’t it.  While the time period of this novel isn’t identified, the impression is Regency or early Victorian.  There is nothing in either main characters’ speech, manners, or actions that give the reader a clue. So for this reader, the time period and setting weren’t there to flesh out the story.<br /><br />The good news is that the central conflict was well enough done to maintain my interest.  It was a bit convoluted, but made sense in the end.<br /><br />Finally, the author needs a better editor as there is some really questionable word usage.  I would also suggest she be a bit more judicious in the frequency of sexual encounters by allowing a bit more tension to develop between the main characters before they hit the sack.  I don’t mind sex scenes in a novel. Anticipated and well done, they can add spice but too much and the dish is ruined.",3.0,0,2020
"You will LOVE this book no matter your age, but especially if your a bit older.","Ok first off I'm already a huge Shannon Mayer fan. So when a new book comes out I read it. Period. No if ands or buts about it. However, having said that. When I found out she was writing a book with a heroine that was a little older and mature, not to mention so relatable to someone like me I jumped at this book.

Aches, pains, wondering what I'm going to do with new situations I never thought I'd be in. Than you add in magic and humor and what's not to love? This book at me hooked from the first chapter.

Great storyline,"Oh, the agony of having to wait for the next book which won't be released until October 9th.<br /><br />The only character in this book from the previous Magelands series is Corthie. It's four and a half years after he was captured. Those years are not detailed but I personally would be interested in reading about them. He is unshaken in his belief that his sister, Karalyn, will rescue him. He isn't even aware of the new powers she possesses so he really does have a lot of faith in her.<br /><br />Corthie is an unthinkable aberration in this new world due to his battle powers. No mortals have powers - only the God-King, God-Queen and their demigod offspring. He soon becomes the Champion of this city, along with a dragon, for their abilities to smite the eternal enemy, AKA greenhides. Why the greenhides persist in endlessly attacking the City for thousands of years with little success is never revealed. It's clear that the greenhides have their own land since they retreat during the rain/fog seasons and obviously procreate since there appear to be a never ending number of them. But I digress...<br /><br />So, Corthie becomes a pawn in the squabbles between the demigods. He does choose a side, primarily due to his attraction to one of said demigods. He additionally learns of a second dragon kept hidden from the majority of the populace and vows to help her escape.<br /><br />Lots of intrigue, new players and a stimulating storyline.

I finally understand Agatha Christie's comment on John Dickson Carr,"I normally don't write book reviews, because I normally don't read them. For one thing, I don't want to run into any spoilers, and for another tastes vary so much that you really can't go too much by what anyone else says.<br /><br />I wanted to make one point though. This is my 9th John Dickson Carr book. I'll cede the fact that ""The Hollow Man"" was a classic, and his historical mysteries are amazing, but  I could never quite see why everyone seemed to be making a big deal about how much Agatha Christie liked his books.  I mean, if I read an Aggie right after reading a JDC mystery, she seems like she's in a class all her own compared to him.  Her novels flow way better than his do, and she creates a picture that's way easier to grasp as a whole.  In short, she seems like a master compared to John Dickson Carr who seems more like he's trying to add enough stuff into his books to make them seem like an Agatha Christie book.<br /><br />Well this book sort of took him to a new level in my opinion, and when I finished, the first thing that came to my mind was, ""OK, Agatha Christie would definitely have liked THAT one.""<br /><br />The good news is that I still have a lot more of his to try.",5.0,1,2020

You can’t take a story seriously if you blatantly ignore some very simple rules...one being that fighter craft are incredibly complex machines.  The only way this could work is if there was an AI helping the recruits...but the author did not write that in.

Interesting Memoir,"After enjoying Molly Wizenberg's two earlier books, I was looking forward to the release of this one. The subject matter is not a usual read for me, however, I do think this author is an exceptional writer and on that basis, I made  the purchase.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, the use of plural pronouns to refer to the non-binary character almost ruined the last 1/3 or so of the book for me. Each time I came across this language, it set my teeth on edge, forcing me to read sentences a second time for clarity. The narrative itself was a bit too explicit for my preference, but then again, I knew what the subject was beforehand, so I have only myself to blame.<br /><br />In spite of the cons above, Ms. Wizenberg is such a fine writer, her artistry very nearly overcomes any perceived negatives in the storyline - I wish her well and hope to read her next work in the not too distant future...",4.0,1,2020

Novella-sized fun with Zakoar and Tessa,"Remember Zakoar in When She Belongs? I just KNEW we'd get to see him once again because he oh-so deserves an HEA all the way. And I appreciate that Ruby Dixon also thought that. He really needed a luscious Human female to really warm him and his metal hardware up.<br /><br />This book does come with some triggers. More like post-war PTSD. Boy, I could really empathize with Zakoar. Reminded me of my guys at our VA-CBOC in Ohio. One of my favorite bunch of patients by far. I certainly did know of their pain and suffering, some that will never go away. And this book only reopened some of that empathic pain I feel around them... But it's something we all should be completely compassionate about. Acceptance without judgment is the only way someone can hope to accomplish when you're trying to connect with someone with PTSD.<br /><br />I really liked the character development in this novella.

What daily life was like in Athens during the classical period,"This book talked about what daily life was like in Athens during the classical period (specifically in 420 BC). The author used a humorous tone but provided good, educational material. He covered war, work, family, food and clothing, class/social structure, politics, religion, entertainment, marriage, travel, crime, trials, slavery, medical practices, illness, and death. He talked about the differences in how men, women, and children were treated as well as the difference between slaves, poor, and rich. After talking about the different aspects of life, the author had pretend interviews with different types of people (teenage girl, widow, crime victim, politician, philosopher, etc.) talking about their life in ancient Athens. Overall, I'd recommend this entertaining way to learn more about daily life in classical Athens (and some about Sparta).<br /><br />I received an ebook review copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.",4.0,1,2020

Love Whitney Dineen's writing,"I am not a chick-lit person and I chose this book as a lark because I was looking for something light that would take my mind off current events.  I read She Sins at Midnight and loved the flavor of Whitney Dineen's writing.  The next thing I knew, I bought The Event and became hooked.  I then bought and read The Move.  I am a Whitney Dineen fan.  Her characters are real and fun.  I would love to meet most of them.  They are down to earth and for the most part, just uplifting to be around.  These are just feel good enjoyable reading.",5.0,1,2020
I can't,"The main character is so unlikable. She has a victim mentality from the beginning, and blames everyone else for constantly taking advantage of her, rather than taking responsibility for allowing them to do it. Then the way she treats her husband- not sharing major parts of her life with him, cancelling his plane ticket without even discussing it, oh and BUYING A HOUSE without even mentioning it. Then she wonders why he'd rather be traveling for work than home with her. She's so insecure, she takes makeup classes to try and look younger. She's 32! What is happening??

Self-Indulgent,"Based on the description, I was expecting a personalized nonfiction history of indigo - something like John McPhee or Susan Orlean would write. Nope. This is just a travel diary of a privileged biracial American who lands a scholarship and goes to Africa. She's obsessed with indigo, for reasons that nobody understands, but gets all judgy because African women wear polyester. Horrors! Every now and again she inserts some historical bit about indigo she read from some book, often getting the details mixed up. I was so disappointed.",1.0,0,2020
"Well researched and deeply imagined, but...","...I think the story of Hannie stood on its own merits, but the parallels to Benny Silva were not convincing and, at the end, not at all authentic. Benny Silva’s story as the embattled teacher within a divided community, should have been developed to completion. Instead, the author drops this struggle, opting for the easy solution—a potential love affair. Suddenly at the end of the story, an entirely new character is introduced—a baby born to teen-aged Benny and placed into adoption. The author draws a very weak parallel to adoption and the legacy of families torn apart by slavery. The bombshell ending cratered the book, and frankly, it’s a rather disgusting, disingenuous and wholly ignorant treatment of two, very different institutions.",2.0,0,2020
Classic Anne Stuart,"So good! I couldn't put it down. If you like Anne Stuart, then you'll love this book. It's similar in feeling to the ""House of Rohan"" series, but I feel like this book has more humor than her other books. I loved all the characters and wouldn't change a thing about any of them.  I love that the heroine is calm and rational. I get tired of reading about heroines who just make a lot of noise and bad decisions. Bryony is very practical, and her sensible attitude is refreshing. Kit, the hero, is the worst man in England, which, of course, makes him the best man to be the hero in an Anne Stuart book. Gotta love those bad boys. As far as side characters, I loved the cousin with her dramatic tendencies and her healthy appetite. Most of Stuart's books have parallel romances occurring, and this one is no exception. The cousin's romance is fun, but I wasn't as engaged with her side love story,. That said, that's typical for me after any book that has parallel romances occurring. I tend to get caught up in the main characters romance and find the side romances less diverting. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about the epilogue. On one hand, I thought it was cute; on the other hand, I found it slightly depressing. I'll try not to give any spoilers, but when I finish a book, I like to imagine that the characters are still living in the prime of their lives. I realize they will eventually grow old and die, but I don't like to acknowledge that aspect of life. Lol. Also, I wonder if Stuart plans on writing a modern romance involving the great, great, great, grand daughter? The epilogue led me to feel like there was more to her story.",5.0,1,2020
Just DONE!,"As much as I love the Kindred World, this is going to be the LAST book I waste my time and money on grim this series. The beginning books were very good but as they continue, they just get worse and worse. By the 25% mark of this book, my eyes hurt from rolling them so hard and often. It was just stupid! What woman, who is DESPERATE to get away from Earth and a stalker, is going to argue at a job interview about something that is a non-issue for her, at the moment? What strong 38 y/o woman says NO ALCOHOL, because she starts her new job the next day, and then allows herself to drink so much that she's hung over the next morning? What woman rubs something on an EXTREMELY intimate part of her body, without knowing what's in it? What woman, in this day and age, freaks out when they find out they might have a (mild) kink? Everything is so implausible, right from the beginning, in this story. It seems to me that Ms. Andersons books went from fairly erotic romances with a good story and characters, to just plain erotica that are all about titillation, no matter how implausible or idiotic the characters need to be. The good story that used to move these books along now takes a backseat to make room for cringe worthy dialog and situations that are, apparently, supposed to be sexy but are just ridiculous. I am so DONE with this series and author! The only reason this book is getting more than 1 star is because this author has a good flow with words and good editing.<br /><br />1 star - Awful! Want my money back!<br />2 stars - Bad but not horrendous.<br />3 stars - Decent/Good<br />4 stars - Really good!<br />5 stars - Excellent! Definitely recommend!",2.0,0,2020

A let down,"WARNING MY REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:<br /><br />This entire series was okay for me, I think it's overhyped but that's just my opinion and preferences. I would say that I am more of a fan of the standalone novels (Punk 57 and Birthday Girl) and the fall away series, the Devil's Night series (Corrupt, Hideaway, Kill Switch and now Nightfall) isn't a series I frequently re-read in all honesty,  and it's not because it's considered a ""dark romance"", I have read multiple dark romances that I enjoy more than the Devil's Night series. I would say that the best novel in this series is Kill Switch, there is something about Damon that just makes me empathize with him and I know I shouldn't because he isn't a good guy at all, but he definitely redeemed himself in Kill Switch.<br /><br />For me Will has always been a throw away character, he really didn't have much character development throughout the series and he is the mess up of the group, but I guess I had higher hopes for this series when this book dropped.<br /><br /> Unfortunately this book was hyped up to the point that (in my mind) the story crashed and burned.<br />The first 50% of the story was a decent storyline (though I will admit that Will irritated me throughout the book, because even though Emory kept telling Will that she wasn't interested in dating him, he kept persuing her). I thought Will was dumb and any time Emory pushed him away (in present time) he should have understood her reasoning. I mean come on her entire teen years her brother physically abused her, that isn't something you casually get over. Bruises and broken bones heal, but psychological damage has accured. It wasn't discussed in the book if Emory ever went to any type of therapy (I'm assuming not) after she left for college, because Penelope Douglas didn't give us any kind of back story for Emory to tell us how she faired while she wasn't in Will's life.<br /><br />The other 50% of this story was basically boring to me to where I started skimming pages (which is uncommon for me when it comes to Penelope Douglas books), it got tiresome to keep seeing Emory and Will arguing back and forth with each other, then one scene I thought was weird for the story involving F/F intimate scenes with the rest of the characters participating and watching the F/F get it on. Why was this necessary for the story? It felt like this scene was just thrown in there because the author needed another intimate scene.<br /><br />This book didn't need to have the secondary characters be more important to the story than the main characters. Alex could have had her own novella, she didn't need to have her HEA in this story, especially because this book was supposed to be about Emory and Will's story. Also I felt bad for Emory because Alex and Will were intimately close (they bumped uglies multiple times when Will and Emory were separated for years). I mean I know that when you aren't together with someone, you are free to be intimate with other people but if Will had such a hang up on Emory, I don't feel like he needed to put his pickle in multiple women. It shows how little respect he has for himself and his feelings for Emory.<br /><br />Lastly this book needed to be cut down at least 200 pages, because it was WAY too long. To me this is the most disappointing read I've ever read from Penelope Douglas, but I am anxiously awaiting for the fall away spinoff series and her book Motel.",2.0,0,2020
A One of a Kind!,"Wow, I really loved reading this book! If you are looking to learn or strengthen your intuition when using the cards, this is a great book for you! Each card has exercises that will help you explore the card with your intuition & a fresh perspective. You also will learn how to view the imagery in a new light and will see the cards in a whole new light. While reading this book, not only will you enhance your intuition but you will see how the Tarot corresponds with your life and can help you through your own personal journey. I think that reading this book is a great modern approach to the Tarot & self exploration. It's not the typical guide and will take you on a great journey that will give you new perspective and learn it's okay to wander a bit from what's the typical path of learning the Tarot! Now, that sounds like a glowing review but let's get real for a moment, this book has a big whoopsie! The King of Pentacles is missing from the book! Oh snap! A star or two taken away, unfortunately. So even though, I enjoyed it so much you can't help but be dissapointed that were a King short of the hand that was dealt.

"A fun Christmas adventure in Salem, Massachusetts with Charlene and her favorite ghost","This was such an awesome Christmas mystery! I just love the cover of this book and could really picture the B&B all decked out for Christmas. I felt sad for Jack knowing how much he's always liked Charlene that he couldn't give her a Christmas hug, but he seemed fairly happy. He always came in handy for helping to research during a case, and he made a good silent sleuthing partner for Charlene. This case was dealing with the murder of one of the locals, and it was actually someone who was a good benefactor, so it was a little sad to have them killed.<br /><br />Charlene was dealing with her parents staying till after Christmas, and her mom wasn't the most likable person, but I have to admit, she grew on me after a while especially what she helped with toward the end. I wasn't right about the killer this time, but finding the real one was a good little adventure and showdown. I'm hoping that Charlene is getting a little closer to opening her heart to Sam after this book, at least they seemed to be in a decent place for now. I really liked Charlene's dad a lot! That man was a saint to put up with her mom lol. And I liked the character of Avery who Charlene hired to help Minnie with housekeeping chores. I hope she sticks around. I'm always anxious for the next book in this series!",5.0,1,2020

One Hundred Million Murdered & Still Counting,"This is a must read for those wondering what Marxism is and the man behind the dogma that has killed over 100 million & enslaved millions more. This is a dark, dark tale of a man who wrote poetry to Satan, eschewed Heaven in favor of Hell. Many who knew him claimed he was demon possessed. “He had the devil’s view of the world, and the devil’s malignity. He seemed to know that he was accomplishing works of evil.” A biographer asserted. (Location 231) His father said of him that he was “governed by a demon”, “my dear devil” by his son, “a monster of ten thousand devils” by Engels, and “wicked knave” by his wife. (Loc. 221). He may not have participated in black masses or believed in any supernatural entities, but what cannot be doubted by any sentient being is the undeniable evil associated with and brought about by Marxist/communist ideology.

"Emotional, gripping, un-put-downable","It's impossible, I think, to not be pulled into this story if you are a parent, especially if you're a mom. When little Emily started to have symptoms, her parents would just attribute them to her being so small and still developing abilities, for example it's not so worrisome for a 2 year old to stumble or use the wrong words.<br />As things get worse for Emily and doctors have no real answers, there are more and more trips to the doctors and hospitals, more and more tests, which are sometimes invasive to the little girl, always without answers.<br />When Emily lapses into a coma, Rachel spends much of her time at the hospital with her little girl while James mostly stays away, and the couple rarely see each other. One day when they are both at their home at the same time he informs Rachel that he is DONE. He can't do this anymore.<br />Three months later he marries Eva, who he tells about Emily on their second date. After that, he doesn't tell Eva much about what is happening with Emily, while Rachel is dealing with the loss of her marriage and the declining state of Emily's undiagnosable illness.<br />After several months of marriage, Eva is still being left in the dark about Emily and James never tells her anything about Rachel. James and Rachel share joint custody, but now that is only about Emily's medical care. When Rachel is not at the hospital, she is searching online for anything that might help her daughter.  When she finds information about a doctor in Italy who may be able to help Emily she tries desperately to get James to agree to take Emily to Italy for the experimental treatment.<br />He refuses to agree to it and when Emily's team of doctors says there is no possibility of any further action helping, they move her to  hospice care against Rachel's wishes, as she wants the doctors to keep trying!<br />Rachel is desperate for help when she shows up at James and Eva's apartment one evening while James is at the hospital. She and Eva have never met but Rachel is desperate. She tells Eva about everything and begs her to talk to James about the treatment in Italy. Rachel doesn't know that Eva has a past heartbreak over a lost baby and is currently trying to get pregnant.<br />Eva and Rachel end up becoming good friends, which I'm not sure I would be able to do, but it is a wonderful thing to see in the story. This is a book that every mother should read, just keep the tissues close. I highly recommend this book, without any doubts! It kept me up much later than usual, I couldn't put it down!<br />I'm looking forward to reading more from this author, and I have never read anything by the authors mentioned in the section that says ""you might like this author if you like...""",5.0,1,2020
I ADORE this book,"First of all, Cricket is one of the best written modern witches I've ever read. Reading this book for the first time actually felt like it replenished my aura and I've never felt more connected to a witch character! All of the characters in this book are just as well developed, and it doesn't read at all like a stereotype of supernatural books I've read in the past. Everything is original and interesting. I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />It's definitely a slow burn, but nothing feels like it's dragging on and no characters are annoyingly obtuse. The entire first book takes place over a week, and I can't wait to read what comes next!<br /><br />Cricket has been one of my comfort books ever since I discovered the unedited version almost a year ago, and this published version is even better with slight tweaks and new scenes.

Good,"Usually I'm a 5 star review always with Ruby but I had a bit of trouble with this one.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Adiron!!! He was probably my fav corsair yet! And maybe fav character out of all the series'! He was funny and ""hot"" and just adorable! I also didn't mind Jade. I thought she was a good match for Adiron. I did get confused with Jade's description though. I totally thought she was Mexican or Spanish. And then like half way through or so, she said something about being black. I get frustrated when descriptions are confusing like that.<br /><br />Overall though, I think the lack of 5 stars, was because I disliked the intimate scenes.

A Worthy Biography of An Amazing Writer,"I first read Shirley Jackson in the 60's, when I was in high school, probably a few years after her death, and have read all of her published work. Coming upon this biography by Ruth Franklin was a wonderful surprise! Franklin's research appears meticulous, and her admiration for Jackson is evident. The writing is superb. My one quarrel is with Franklin's detours, e.g., a lengthy discourse about the New York literary scene of the 1930's and 1940's that felt long-winded. As interested as I am in that topic, I found myself skimming some of it, and wanting to get back to Jackson's life. I felt the same way, but less so, about the amount of time dedicated to Stanley Edgar Hyman. Yes, he was a pivotal figure in Jackson's life, and some background information on him is both important and appropriate, but at times I felt as though I was reading a double biography. That said, overall I enjoyed this very much and will probably reread Judy Oppenheimer's early bio of Jackson.",4.0,1,2020
Havenfall,"I really loved Sara Holland's Everless duology Havenfall sounded amazing, so I decided to read it once I got it.<br />Shall we cover the good and bad???<br /><br />The Bad and confusing:<br />•While it kind of goes right into the story, it drags on and says or hint at the same things over and over.<br />• There was a lot of information that could have been added to the storyline and if Maddie's self deprecation and feeling sorry for herself were cut out of every few pages that this story really could have moved on a lot quicker and could have been more developed.<br />•Personally, I feel so cheated that the realms are mentioned repeatedly in this book and you get hints as to what the places will be like, but you never see any of them!!!<br />•Brekken. Why, as a soldier, would you run away back home if you witnessed a murder instead of going to the Innkeeper Marcus to begin with?🤷‍♀️<br />•It was pretty obvious who the bad guy was once he was brought into the story as a main focal point.<br />•Does Maddie's father not know about Nate? Ever? It seems very confusing how the father would never tell Maddie that Nate wasn't her biological brother..<br /><br />The Good:<br />The premise behind this book is fantastic! I love the realms and that the main character is not a princess or of royalty.<br /><br />In closing,<br />I REALLY hope the next book goes in detail about the realms and we actually get to see someone go in their realm so we know what it's all about. What really happened with the Solarians that caused them to be written out? More on the great (great?) grandma and her connection with the Solarians.<br />I hope their is little to no self deprecation and feeling sorry for oneself.",3.0,0,2020
How did this become a classic?,"I'm not sure if I've ever been more disappointed in a book.  This has been on my reading list for decades, and I finally got to it.<br /><br />As a huge fan of authors like Robert Heinlein, David Brin, and Phillip Dick, I thought this would be right up my alley.  I really couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of the book were filled with outstanding hard science fiction that ha sstood the test of time very well.  That's the reason why I gave it two stars.<br /><br />The last 1/4 of the book transforms into a mystical fantasy world that would be more at home for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.  It would seem as if the author's intention was to leave us with the feeling of not knowing what the heck was going on, but I really could have done without all of the magical mysticism.<br /><br />Perhaps this book was groundbreaking and insightful back in the 1960s, but in the year 2020, the only compelling part about this story left is HAL, who occupies a very minor (and consequently quite insignificant role) in the story.  Many of the concepts explored have stood the test of time well.  The story has not, and the transformation from hard science fiction to whimsical fantasy left me scratching my head.<br /><br />I am so glad that this is now in my past.

For the Love of Movies,"I confess that I haven't finished reading this book, but I have read enough to know that I like the way she thinks and writes. I can disagree with her very often, but I still love her cogent analyses of films and related subjects. There is no use of star-ratings in her works. I read her the first time way back in the mid-eighties when she analyzed the film Platoon, a movie I liked back then and I still like and consider a great film. She didn't like it and she reasoned effectively why she wasn't so impressed by this film as most other critics were. Although I felt like disagreeing with her back then, there was little I could think of to counter her arguments. Now, I have a chance to read things she wrote before and after I was born.<br /><br />The book is a compendium of excerpts of books she has written about films and critical essays on many important films. Among the books this volume borrows from are: I Lost It at the Movies, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Going Steady, Deeper into the Movies, Reeling, When the Lights Go Down, Taking it All In, State of the Art, and Movie Love. This prolific writer of movie criticism analyzes films using her knowledge of society, culture, and economics, as well as literary works that are the basis for movies. She prefers movies that offer meaning over movies that are simply spectacular; she raises her brows toward possible hidden messages that directors may send through their choices; she suspects the mass culture that inhibits individuality and that often controls the messages or lack of messages in films.<br /><br />Her views on many films may be controversial, but well-reasoned. This text also includes her views of many American and foreign classic films; a short bio of Cary Grant, an actor she admired so much, a Norman Mailer book on Marilyn Monroe; and a critique on a book about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, among other things. It is pity that she isn't around anymore. In my book, she is THE CRITIC. Great book.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is quite helpful because it provides an interactive Table of Contents that allows you to go back and forth into the text.",5.0,1,2020
Great Story of Sisters!!!,"The Sweeney Sisters by Lian Dolan is a delightful read! I must admit that I am a listener and fan of Lian Dolan's podcast The Satellite Sisters, where I originally heard of this book. Another reason I wanted to read it is that she came to my hometown last year to work on it (there is a mention in the credits of Sonoma County, but I know she was in Sebastopol), so I knew I had to get my hands on this book. The Sweeney Sisters is a story about sisters and it is so obvious that Ms. Dolan is really a sister because she nails, with precision, the silly, complex, and fierce loyalty of sister relationships. I have two sisters and so many of the interactions with Liza, Maggie, and Tricia rang true and made me feel such a kinship to these ladies. I felt like I was there with them quite often because I could picture myself having the same sort of conversations, rolling my eyes, glancing with one of them while the other is talking crazy, knowing what we are all thinking without saying it, and so much more. If you have sisters, you will love feeling a part of this dysfunctional family's situations and if you do not have sisters, you can get a true glimpse of what it would be like. The story begins with Bill Sweeney, a true literary giant, passing unexpectedly and the sisters coming back to their Connecticut hometown to mourn, wrap things up with his estate, and find out there is a fourth Sweeney sister they knew nothing about, although they knew her (hello widespread, inexpensive DNA testing!). The girls went from thinking it was just the three of them (their mother, a published poet, passed of cancer years prior) to now having what would essentially be a 'party crasher' added to their tightknit clique of three. How would it feel to grow up truly knowing your sisterly dynamics, having no doubt of where everyone stands, to wondering how you will add in this outsider that 'suddenly', through no fault of her own, shares half your DNA.",5.0,1,2020
There will be serious spoilers in this review - no away around it to get my point across,"I absolutely LOVE Ms. Vales writing style and characters but there's no getting around the fact that her stores have been seriously lacking for a while now. Drama comes up and then is solved very simply and easily. There's no tension after that first initial ""oh, $#!+"" moment. This book set up some serious drama but it's solution very anticlimactic and unrealistic.<br /><br />Here's the spoilers -<br /><br />Banner was harassed so badly that he had to move away from home to an entirely new town and school to get away from it. The kid followed him to continue his harassment. We're supposed to believe that a guy who is so obsessed that he'd follow someone to a new state, to continue messing with him, who's so bad that he'd assault a girl and leave her beaten and half naked, would just give up and go away because of a simple ""I'm sorry"" and ""I won't play college ball""?!?! Yes, we're given the impression that the fathers did something, as well, but it's never confirmed what it was or that it even actually took place.<br /><br />The set up was there for some real in-depth drama and a great story but it just petered out. That's been happening in the majority of Ms. Vales books for a while now. Frankly, at this point, I'm losing hope that she'll get back the intensity of her earlier works and I'm now just reading for the characters and writing style. Pretty soon, that's not going to be enough for me and I'll lose another of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Basically, this story was probably a 2 but her excellent writing style, good editing, and awesome characters bumped it up to a 3.<br /><br />I'm really sad writing this review because LLV books were something I really looked forward to for a long time but it's been so long since I've read a really satisfying one that I now have to stop and really contemplate if I want to spend the money. She used to be a no-question, automatic buy for me, and now I can definitely see a time coming when the answer to that question will be a ""No"". Frankly, if it had been any other author, that ""No"" would have come about 5 to 10 books back but, like I said, she has an excellent writing style and characters.<br /><br />Sad.<br /><br />1 star - Awful! Want my money back!<br />2 stars - Bad but not horrendous.<br />3 stars - Decent/Good<br />4 stars - Really good!<br />5 stars - Excellent! Definitely recommend!",3.0,0,2020
Low 4 star,"This one is a bit hard to review.  The hero is more heroic than most ""harem fantasy"" heros are, but that's not saying much since most are more anti-hero than hero.  However, this time we truly have a heroic man who ends up on the ""monster"" island thanks to falling overboard in a story while saving some stranded sailors.  He soon falls for several of the monster girls he meets and discovers that their people are in great danger.<br /><br />To avoid spoilers I won't say more, but overall its a fun story.  The monster girls are more fleshed out as characters with personalities than your average harem girl, and the heor is as I said actually heroic.<br /><br />So very worth reading.",4.0,1,2020

"Great premise, poor execution. Too many things didn't add up. Based on 'real' events?","Two families living on adjacent farms on the remote prairie in Wyoming.  The nearest civilization is 20 miles away by horse or wagon.  One of the husbands catches his wife having intimate relations with the neighbor man down by the river.  He shoots the adultering man and then ends up being jailed for the duration of the book, forcing his wife and four children to move in with the the dead man's widow and son on the adjacent farm in order to survive the worst winter EVER!<br /><br />I thought this book would never end.  I love historical novels and the book description sounded amazing.  I was hooked.  Unfortunately, I had to push myself to finish this very forgettable novel.  First off, I didn't like any of the characters.  Books with unlikable characters set the tone poorly for the entire reading experience.<br /><br />It would have helped if the story would have been laid out more directly instead of dedicating each character's viewpoint to chapters relating to the same events.  Furthermore, if one is going to risk ruining the lives of the all the people living within  a 20 mile radius of a remote area by committing adultery, wouldn't you expect there to be some sort of strong, sexual attraction where she found the man's masculinity irresistible with maybe some iota of emotional feeling or passion toward the man?  I wasn't expecting any bodice ripping per se, but the fact she laid on her back staring at cottonwood trees with her legs spread while he had his way with her was puzzling to say the least.<br /><br />Granted, she may have felt her husband hated her for what she did, but even if the jail was 20 miles away, it seemed unrealistic that she made no effort to stay in touch with her husband if only for the sake of the children.  She may not have had a convenient means to travel the distance, but the neighbors went to town occasionally to pick up mail or buy and trade supplies.  Did the children even miss their father? He was supposedly a kind, generous man being a good husband and father.  There'd be a reasonable chance the younger children would not remember their father by the time he was released from jail for his 2 year sentence.  Did this thought ever cross his wife's mind?",2.0,0,2020

A worthy addition to your Christian bookshelf,"The Story of Reality is a strong contender in the crowded Apologetics bookshelf.  Koukl takes a very simple approach, breaking down Christianity into a basic story, made up of five chapters: God, man, Jesus, cross, and resurrection.  And for the most part, this approach works.  Koukl's comes across as a gentle teacher, one who is not interested in admonishing, or trashing other worldviews, but instead attempting to disseminate important, deep, and sometimes very difficult truths, in a manner that is palatable.<br /><br />He weaves a story through the 5 chapters that builds on itself, without getting bogged down in the minutia and scholarship  that is prevalent in so many books of this type, culminating in a point where the reader must accept the truth of Jesus and his sacrifice as presented, or reject it and take their chances with God.<br /><br />Koukl has a knack for tackling even the most difficult truths, such as the existence of hell, or eternal damnation, in a way that does not make you angry, even if you disagree, but instead makes you think, and ponder the weight of his words.<br /><br />All in all, a worthy addition to your Christian bookshelf.<br /><br />---------------<br />I noticed Amazon and Goodreads have a slightly different meanings to their 5-point scale. I thought it was odd to have a different rating for the same book on two different sites, so I came up with my own scale below. For the record, it is fairly close to Amazon's scale, but allows me to be consistent between the two sites.<br /><br />5 - Fantastic. Life-altering. Maybe only 30 in a lifetime.<br />4 - Very good.<br />3 - Worth your time.<br />2 - Not very good.<br />1 - Atrocious.",4.0,1,2020
Mixed Emotions,"This book was on a list I saw on CNN, recommended to read this summer.  I don't read romance books, but the premise sounded good and, perhaps, more ""women's"" fiction.  January is trying to cope with the loss of her father and the secrets that surfaced after his death.  She goes to his hometown, to a cottage he has left her.  She is a romance writer with writers' block as well with a book due in months.  Next door is Gus, a published writer of serious fiction.  He is in the middle of a crisis of his own. A contest is suggested by January; he write a romance with a happy ending, she write a literary novel.  That part of the book is good and interesting.  Can a good writer write a good book out of his/her comfort zone and chosen genre? Unfortunately, the book then turns into a quite steamy romance book.  I was disappointed and frankly, skipped a good bit of the details.  Just not my kind of book!  By the end's resolution, I was back to liking the book and the statement it was making. Maybe ""happy today"" is good enough.  I give 4 stars to the beginning and end and a 3 star (or less) to the middle.",4.0,1,2020
This is the best non-fiction I've ever read,"Amanda Montell in writing Wordslut: A Feminist Guide to Taking Back the English Language has set a new standard for conveying factual information.  She has done a ton of research and has incorporated it into the narrative seamlessly.  She not only explains how language has evolved as a primary support to the patriarchy, but she also explains the subtleties of how men and women support this.  Then she cleverly, and with humor, tells us how to combat language that diminishes and demeans women from the streets to the boardroom.  I think everyone needs to read this book and it needs to be taught in from our elementary schools on up to as an adjunct to masters and doctoral programs.  This is an excellent book club read - and I'd love to be a fly on the wall to listen to the discussions.  It deserves 10 stars out of 5.

This “hero” is unredeemable,"I don’t know why authors think this kind of story is romantic. This guy left a girl who truly loved him to chase fame, fortune, and other women. The heroine stayed in their hometown and spent the next 5 years dedicating her life to being the mother of his child. He come back to town not because he loves her, but for another reason. He’s already moved on and ready to marry another reason. Normally I prefer a second chance novel to only have a 5 year ish gap, but in this case all is does is reiterate how fickle and shallow that he is. He started sleeping around probably immediately, seriously basically dating right away and now even though he is famous and has every reason to focus on work (and maybe secretly mousse the woman who gave up everything for him and to bring his kid into the world) nope he’s all serious and ready to marry some skank. He just isn’t a well written characters. Even though the author tries to pretend he’s better, his actions show differently. He’s shallow, and selfish. He is completely unredeemable. I wish theses kinds of authors understand that you can’t just decide that a character deserves a second chance. They need to write him as deserving. They need to give him the characteristics of someone deserving. They can’t just randomly state, “he’s a good person” that’s a summery not a well developed characters. I’m not sure I can give this author a chance after this.",1.0,0,2020
Very interesting story,"A great book from James Files who claims he was the grassy knoll assassin who delivered the fatal shot that killed John F. Kennedy.  He talks about his mob connections, illuminates certain answers to questions on the assassination, and also tells a few details about other operations he was involved in(CIA related).  Many dismiss Files but he certainly gets a lot of the reoccurring names involved right from both the mob and the CIA.

Betwixt is a great beginning to a new series by Darynda Jones,"Darynda Jones’ new series, Betwixt & Between, begins with recent divorcée Defiance Dayne who lives in Arizona inheriting a house in Salem, Massachusetts from a woman she has never heard of.  Having lost everything in her divorce except her vintage Volkswagen Beetle, she drives to Massachusetts. The story opens with her having just arrived at the address where she is to meet the lawyer who is to give her the keys to her, new to her, old house which is named Percival. Dephne falls in love with the old house as soon as she sees it, despite seeing that it needs a lot of work. Percival lets people know if he doesn’t like them, including one annoying neighbor who confronts Defiance about what she is going to do to fix up her house.  Interesting characters include her best friend Annette, stunningly handsome handyman Roane, Police Chief Houston Metcalf, Dephne’s grandmother, and of course her house Percival.<br />I highly recommend this wonderful new story from Darynda Jones!",5.0,1,2020
"Idea, great it was, Execution... well.... can we put the story on the chopping block?","Another truly great idea for a tale, but the characters (unsympathetic), villains (too vaguely defined), and plot (too convoluted) all drag this story down several flights of metaphorical stairs.<br /><br />It is a mess.<br /><br />First, the hero is another angsty whiny brat.  In this case the hero gets put into danger by a seemingly random event that boosts his personal point count without giving him any idea of why or how.  And since he's a neophyte, he now both needs to increase his skill to become a champion, and avoid all the champions who want him dead so that they can be on the top of the leader board.<br /><br />Its an interesting idea, but as I said, hero is angsty whiny brat.  His ""mentor"" is a drunk, angry, mostly uncommunicative donkey's rear end, who is blamed for something in a way to make it both true (he did the dead he's accused of) and false (the person he did it to both volunteered and had already been mortally wounded so he was not the direct cause of her death.)  [Note - the mentor's initial arrogance is shown in a prologue and demonstrates just how bloody dumb the character was.]<br /><br />Add in guilds that don't support members, a world that sees prices rise because peace is coming in six months, and generally incomprehensible world-building.  And I had a story that frustrated me far too often.<br /><br />But again, I've recently posted my absolute hatred of angsty characters in multiple reviews for different series, so my review is definitely tainted by that.  Your enjoyment might be much higher if you have a tolerance for indecision and bad choices.<br /><br />Low 3 star for me.  I doubt I'll read book 2 when/if it comes out.",3.0,0,2020

Another Home Run - Book 1 in a Series!,"This book is so much more than a mystery, a police procedural, a suspense novel, or a story centered around Mormon fundamentalist.

No matter where you end up, where you started haunts you. And the people you love? You carry them with you, whether you realize it or not.”<br /><br />“Perhaps it was more a testament to my journey, and that the pain and disappointments of my past had made me stronger.”<br /><br />“Despite all we had been through together, despite all I’d done, the distance between me and my mothers persisted, a canyon that separated me from those who were mine.”<br /><br />“I gave her a last hard look and considered the beauty of a woman content in her world, someone who understood where she belonged. That would never be me.

A great thrill ride even if a bit surreal.,"I have to admit that the first half of this book was better than the last half. Not that it is a bad book, far from it in fact, just that it get a bit surreal. I also kept thinking that it would make one hell of a movie.

Why is this important to Sigma Force? Because another group is also seeking this lost city and not for humanitarian reasons. It's up to Sigma to stop them.<br />There is plenty of action in this book and much of the story is based on mythology and what some experts believe are facts. This was, to me, the best part of the book. I've always felt that many of the ancient myths are based to a certain degree on historical events. Discoveries made by the characters in the book utilize some of these theories as well as some of the author's own theories. It's good stuff.",4.0,1,2020
Mixture of real and alternative history,"This book is described as a mixed-genre alternative history science fiction novel. The concept is that Charlie Benjamin, an American fellow, determines he is of royal British lineage, a descendant of the tribe of Benjamin. The book consists of fictional vignettes of Charlie's unusual life in the midst of vast sections of, I assume, actual history.<br /><br />I have issues with Nienaber's theological foundation for the story. He says Saul's betrayal ended God's covenant with eleven of the tribes, the result being the eleven tribes had no covenant with God and “only the twelfth Tribe of Benjamin and their descendants were the Chosen People.” (Locs 295/4069, 279/4069) He references 2 Samuel 7:14 as God establishing His covenant with the Benjamins. (Loc 279/4049) He later attributes the staying power of the tribe of Benjamin to the “power of the lineage of David, the king of the Jews...” (Loc 357/4069) He also says Jesus was a Benjamin. (Loc 403/4069) This could be part of the alternative history concept as I have absolutely no idea how he came to those statements. The covenant made in 2 Samuel 7:14 was with David and his descendants. David was from the tribe of Judah. (Matt. 1) Jesus was from the tribe of Judah. (Matt. 1) The actual biblical account tells us Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin and his betrayal resulted in God transferring leadership to David, of the tribe of Judah. Nienaber's whole concept of the Benjamins being the Chosen People has no biblical basis. If any one tribe could be considered as Chosen, it would have to be the tribe of Judah, not Benjamin.<br /><br />There is a ton of history presented in this book and I assume most of it is accurate. Nienaber suggests members of the tribe of Benjamin migrated north and became the Barbarians of the fourth century and, continuing north, the Merovingians. Benjamite descendants became kings and rulers but ultimately were swindled out of their proper rule. Hence, Charlie restoring the rightful ruling lineage. I have no idea how much of that idea is accurate or if that is part of the alternative history concept. Nienaber frequently writes of scholars believing this or that but includes no footnotes.<br /><br />I feel the book could have used some additional editing (it is self-published). There is repetition. Charlie has unusual abilities. Nienaber says the abilities showed up “about every fifth or sixth generation...” (Loc 101/4069) He repeats that just two paragraphs later (Loc 117/4069) and then again near the end. (Loc 3644/4069) Another evidence of needed editing is a doctor having an “emergency stint procedure” instead of a stent procedure. (Loc 3866/4069)<br /><br />This might be a book for readers who like history. There is lots of it in this novel. I did not find the book entertaining nor engaging.<br /><br />I received a complimentary digital copy of this book through Lavidge. My comments are an independent and honest review.",3.0,0,2020
"Well, it’s easy to follow I guess...","I read a lot of true crime books and this one was written in a way that I actually did enjoy. I was very caught up in the story up until a certain point, somewhere around the actual trial it became harder to enjoy. That is a challenge all crime books probably have to overcome, writing about a trial in a way that keeps the reader interested. Sometimes even if the facts are interesting they can be written about in a boring way. The story aside, I also started to feel like I didn't really like Ms. Muse's personality much. Maybe it was just the way the story was written but it's hard to continue a read when I start finding I don't really like the main character.

Interesting history.,"I got into this one for two reasons. First, as a long time Floridian who spends a lot of time in the areas covered (much of the state, actually) I wanted to get into the discussion of the people who shaped our culture (?) and history. Second, the book makes the claim that the Florida land boom and bust was a huge contributor to the collapse of the economy in the nineteen twenties and actually makes a pretty good case for that. Well written, notated and sourced and worthy of interest for any Floridian - go ahead, pick out a spot on the beach, grab a drink,  plop your carcass down and settle in for a worthy read.<br /><br />Also, talk about a great life lesson - ""...not one of Florida's four real estate kings survived the boom with either his fortune or his health intact. One drank himself to death, one ate himself to death, one worked himself to death, and one most probably committed suicide on a desperate, drunken dare"".

Wonderful story of waking up and living IRL,"What an interesting story. Mia is a super-successful social media influencer, to the point where it's become a monster. She's unhappy, but as long as she immerses herself in the NRL (not real life), she doesn't have to face her grief and move forward. Paige is a freaky-smart computer programmer with low EQ. A suicide-attempt survivor, she's subject to debilitating panic attacks. Her job is to deal with trolls and other bad elements behind the scenes on social media--the same app where Mia is such a force. (The way she has learned to cope, however unhealthily, reminds me of Elinor Oliphant is Completely Fine.) When Paige's little sister, Jessica, tries to kill herself, Paige is forced out of her bubble. Paige is nine years older than Jessica and is more of a mother to her than their own pathetic mother.<br /><br />The story asks how our addiction to our tech tools might be causing us to miss out on our lives, but it goes so much deeper than that. Grief is the driving theme. Dysfunctional mothers. And living in such a way as to represent the opposite of mindfulness.<br /><br />There are so many great characters in this story, not the least of which is Azalea, the achingly sweet little 10-year old neighbor of Mia's mother, who is still too young to realize her widowed dad doesn't know how to dress her. She's uncomfortable in her clothes but hasn't yet been assimilated by our appearances-crazy, conformist society. Mia, the trend-setting fashion dictator, sees this and the realization hurts.<br /><br />The Bright Side is women's fiction with romance. I loved it. Highly recommended.",5.0,1,2020

Not  nearly as good as the Cook Brothers series,"I had very high hopes for the book.  I absolutely loved the whole Cook brothers series, but this book was not very good at all.  I didn't think it had much of a plot.  The Cook brothers books each had wonderful, unique plots that were funny and also steamy.  Maybe if I hadn't read the first series I wouldn't have been so harsh, but this fell flat.  My other big problem with this book was that Renee said she would never date another firefighter because of her past experience with one.  That is ridiculous!  You can not judge a whole profession by one person, whatever that profession is.  There was definitely chemistry between Marco and Renee, but I was expecting so much more.  If you haven't read the Cook brothers, you really should.  Each one is a gem!!  Loved them all. I'm not sure if I will read any more of this series.  Of course this is my opinion.  I was just very disappointed in this book.",2.0,0,2020
Better than Most I have read on Kindle Unlimited,"Having read numerous books through my Kindle Unlimited subscription, I am convinced that the authors who write these mysteries pretty much all sound alike and all need to employ serious editors.  Lots of grammar, spelling, syntax mistakes in all of these.  This book was not as bad in terms of structure, and the characters were  more interesting and likable than the usual group of nitwits.  Even though most were one-dimensional (e.g., totally nasty, totally irritating, totally clueless, etc.), the story and the lead character Mary were pretty well done.  Mary is the only one with any depth and her back story is believable.  The murder itself is pretty contrived and most likely impossible to actually carry out in the way that is described, but watching Mary solve it is entertaining.  The twist about hidden treasure at the end is a nice surprise.  Will be reading the next in this series.",3.0,0,2020
TEDIOUS!,"I usually give two stars to a book I was able to finish even if I thought it was terrible. I just couldn't force myself to do so for this book. Page after page of boring conversation, the same things repeated over and over again. The conversation was choppy and the people seemed like cardboard cutouts. Gerard was wimpy, not the hero type for me. He should have stood up against his stepmother. Strange too that his brother never referred to Gerard by name only by ""Your Grace!"". The heroine, Vivien, was okay. This was the first book that I've read where the companion (Vivien) was also a maid. Vivien was introduced to people as a companion, but was referred to as a maid. Then another time just a maid and a former companion???? There was no romance, no connection between the h and h. A ball was given towards the end of the book and said people were invited from London, France and Spain! The ball was at a country estate. Now wouldn't it have taken people weeks and weeks to travel from France and Spain during the Regency period as steam ships were mainly used on canals and rivers during that time? None of the people invited seemed to stay at the estate. Strange. The mystery was no mystery whatsoever.  I cannot understand the good reviews for this book.",1.0,0,2020
A little better than the last,"I have to say this book was an improvement over the last series that centered around Eric and Jane. But only slightly, as it still needs an editor.  Granted, ""we at the museum in the morning"" is a great way to start a sentence, lol, but not when you want the book to be remembered for something other than mistypes.<br /><br />The story between Matthew and Nina is convoluted and doesn't always move smoothly from one scene to another.  Unless the H is blind, he has to know Nina is being beaten, and unless Nina is an idiot, which she is not, then she has to know that Zola is coming after her husband.<br /><br />The fact that it was written into a cliffhanger is something that Nicole French really does well, and for no reason other than she'd like to sell more books.  This book could have been at least 2 chapter shorter and the story would have been the same, and I'm sure the next book is the same.  I was very pleased to see that no stereotypes were used in this book...although ""doll"" when spoken by certain gentlemen of certain ethnic backgrounds is their way of making sure they aren't calling the wife by the mistresses name.<br /><br />I had pre-ordered this like a fool. Next time I wait for it in KU or I don't read it.  This was not worth more than 99 cents as compared to other books out there.",3.0,0,2020
Review of the entire trilogy.,"Book one was pretty good.  A new world, hints of a unique universe/death/magic system.  Interesting characters, a bit of a coming of age tale.  Nice story.  Book two, more of the same.  Three to four stars for these first two books.  Readable, with only some small consistency flaws.  Big build up to the battle, long battle and it's over the second hero man shows up, that was kind of an easy battle! type stuff.<br /><br />Book three, ugh.  Badly needed an editor.  Trying not to give away a spoiler, I was initially pleased the main character became more self reliant, but then a plot device came along that took that away as well.  New boring characters were introduced late in the book, with elaborate back stories that didn't advance the plot, just new people, we don't really care about, and won't be with us for long anyway.  Why?  The character PoV switched every chapter, even when not a whole lot of interesting things were happening, in that part of the world.  At best you're getting tiny bits of interesting ""this is a clue to how the universe works"" but hidden within the slog of boring.  I just wanted it to be over.",2.0,0,2020
What an amazing look inside the White House,"This is my first political memoir and Obama has set the bar very high for any other political memoirs I may read in the future. He is detailed, but not boring. He's very well written and engaging. I feel as if I didn't just read a book, I felt as if we had a conversation. He's also very funny and relatable, which makes this book easy to read.<br /><br />Obama had his presidency well in hand. He definitely doesn't make it look easy though. It's clear from reading his memoir that he's intelligent and also intuitive. The confidence he exudes in this memoir is appropriate, he's not an overconfident bore. You get the idea he could find common ground with anyone, and genuinely liked speaking with people.<br /><br />I did find certain parts of his story frustrating. The Tea Party movement, misinformation, and destructive Republicans in general made it hard to read sometimes. Obviously, this isn't a complaint about the book itself. He writes about these issues masterfully. His kindness and patience with these people who would do him (and his family, and the country) harm is a testament to what a good man he is.<br /><br />He really comes to life when he's talking about Michelle and/or his daughters. I'd love to read a 750 page book about just his family and personal life.<br /><br />I can't wait for the second part of this memoir to be released. It was amazing getting a look inside the White House.",5.0,1,2020
"Dinosaurs, prions, and thieving geneticists","I first read this book around 1996.  I reread this in 2020, and my memory of the book had long been overridden by the Lost World movie, which has a little in common with this book.  I also read Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lost World (from 1912) right before rereading this book, and Lost World Jurassic Park is thankfully much less racist than that one.<br /><br />This sequel to Jurassic Park was not as exciting or as fun as the original Jurassic Park, but it was still good.  The plot focuses on several scientists/teachers/professors: Thorne, a wealthy retired professor who now builds highly complex RVs, Richard Levine, a paleontologist, Sarah Harding, a carnivorous animal behavior specialist of some sort, and Ian Malcolm, who we all thought was killed off in the original Jurassic Park (or at least that is what JP book says), but has somehow recovered and is now back to being a mathematics professor.  The book also has two children tag along, perhaps as an effort to convince parents that the future movie version of Lost World was family friendly and meant for kids, Arby and Kelly.  Past me might have said the kids are annoying and shouldn’t be included, but I actually found that the kids were fine and once again ended up being the much needed computer experts.  I especially liked Arby, who has a complicated childhood as an only child with professional yet mostly absentee parents.  (Your mileage may vary – the movie version of kids I think was rolled into one child who may or may not have been a little annoying.  The kids in the book were fine with me.)<br /><br />The plot focuses on Thorne, Malcolm, and Eddie Carr, an engineer, (and the kids, hiding in the RV) traveling to Isla Sorna (Site B) to rescue Dr. Levine.  Sarah Harding shows up a few hours later, to join in the rescue attempt, by hitching  a ride with geneticist Lewis Dodgson (the guy who was trying to steal the Dino embryos in the first Jurassic Park book).  Dodgson, along with two other colleagues, is still trying to get his own dinos by stealing eggs.<br /><br />Site B was the breeding laboratory for dinosaurs that were then transferred to Jurassic Park, and like most things involving genetics, there was a lot of trial and error before getting things right.  This site was abandoned after the whole InGen was shut down after the every of Jurassic Park, and many dinosaurs got out and are now living and breeding on the island (this is background, not part of the actual book plot, although I would read that book).<br /><br />The plot mostly focuses on a.) finding Dr. Levine, b.) studying the behavior of dinosaurs in the “wild”, c.) understanding what is causing the dinos to act more erratic than usual , d.) surviving, and e.) not being killed off by “the bad guys”.  The bad guys were never really a threat to anyone except Sarah Harding on the boat, and unlike the movie, there wasn’t a whole troop of guys with guns trying to kill the dinosaurs, mostly just Dodgson, who was trying to steal eggs.<br /><br />Since I’ve just read A.C. Doyle’s Lost World, I would like to mention that Crichton’s Lost World has many more dinosaurs, fewer highly problematic “ape-men” (none), and was a whole lot less racist.  I thought Isla Sorna having sheer cliffs making an entrance or exit to the island hazardous was similar to Doyle’s Lost World plateau, but there were not that many similarities between the two.  The only small criticism for this book is that the ending seemed anti-climatic to me.  There are no big discoveries (other than prion disease, which I had no idea what I prion was when I was 15-16 years old reading this book, but I do now), no big resolutions.  This book did not seem that suspenseful, and I was never that worried for most of the protagonists, but that might be because I’ve already read this book and seen the movie.<br /><br />All the familiar dinosaurs from Jurassic Park are back – T-rexes, hadrosaurs, velociraptors, triceratops, as well as a pair of camouflaging predators that can match their backgrounds like chameleons or octopi.  Is this a feature of the Indominous Rex in Jurassic World?  I’m not sure.<br /><br />Lost World Jurassic Park was fun, escapism fiction for me, and I’m glad I reread it.  I struggle with some of Crichton’s later works, when scientists somehow are always the “bad guys”, climate-change denial runs rampant (State of Fear), evil scientists are working on human-chimp hybrids (Next), and I don’t even remember what scientists did wrong in Micro, only that almost all of them were killed off in horrific ways.  Those books turned me off to Crichton’s work in general.  But, after rereading this one, I think I might continue my reread of Michael Crichton.  The two Jurassic Park novels may well be the first science fiction books I ever read, and I have a special place in my heart for these two books.",4.0,1,2020

Sweet Angels in Heaven this book was good!!,"NR Walker has gotten herself another stunning read. This one is about angels, who are destined to be together, but still stay separate. There was so much humor on this book, especially Nathaniel ' s surprised  reactions to life on earth. He can't swear, or smite things, and it really annoys him to no end. The last thing he smote was the copy machine that everyone hated. Saint Peter didn't want him to smote anything on earth, or swear, so he stripped him of those powers. The hilarity ensues when twenty four year old children becomes his job to teach.<br />  There is angst, and there is love, and there are tears, shed both by myself and by both the angels.<br />This is my first book of 2020, and am very pleased to start out the year with a truly blessed book.",5.0,1,2020

I'm refusing gifts from now on ...,"I was gifted this book, and at the same time I'm writing this review, I see it was optioned by Passionflix for a movie. Good God, will this woman lie her way through the movie too?<br /><br />Apparently, the writer is very good at character development, but incapable of writing a likable heroine. I was ready to throw the Kindle at 17%, the decided I would plug through.  Ready to mark it as DNF at 25%. Then decided no, I would force myself to finish this if it is the last book I ever read.  As frustrated as I was over this story, I was close.<br /><br />Note to author - I know its great to brag that you are in the top 100 on Amazon, and I know its great that you can write a wonderful blurb for the story that causes you to sell far more books than the book itself deserves.  Your writing is just ok, you won't win any awards unless and until you learn how to write so people like your characters AND the plot, which suffered because your main female was too shallow to make the plot strong.  The two work together to create a story - just like in a movie - put a movie star in that role, and hand her a lousy script, you have a bomb.  Maybe, just maybe I'll read another book of yours sometime in the future, but not anytime soon, not if you write your characters like this.  And keep in mind, a reader can dislike a character for a multitude of reasons and still like the book.  That didn't happen here because you chose to make that dis-likable character the ""star"" of the book and have her win the hunky guy, even though, with that attitude, he'd be a fool to touch her with a ten foot pole.<br /><br />And the other thing I will never do again is accept a gift of a book without having the gifter read ALL the reviews next. I prefer my books to be written with a slightly higher level of education, appeal to a broad range of ADULT women, and have both plot and characters I like.  I'm also never going to read another book that Passionflix options - it is now 5/1 against liking the books they decide are movie-worthy.  Sad but true.",1.0,0,2020

Government Becomes Too Powerful,"It is extremely unsettling to realize that government employees who are civil servants are actually not accountable for their actions. The details of criminal proceedings that involve the Federal Government show the interpretation of the law will always favor the law maker. There is no real recourse for private citizens. There is no real monetary settlement when a case is decided in a private citizen's favor. This brings back the words of Thomas Jefferson, a government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take away everything. It's shows that the greedy and corrupt have gotten into government like the Founders feared. It's very sad, reform is possible but not probable. The suggestions to improve the system were interesting but unlikely to happen. The book is a good read and an enlightening one.",4.0,1,2020
Such a great holiday rom com in the little town of Blue Moon!,"I absolutely love every single trip back to Blue Moon that Lucy Score gives us.

Tedious,"Up until somewhere in the second book I thought it was great!  Then it just got agonizingly slow--flicking between settings--as few as two or three paragraphs to catch up with so and so here and so and so there, and NOTHING would happen--often, you'd just have someone's useless thoughts or worries before jumping to another setting.  And it just got worse, and worse and worse, to the point I was skipping over pages and pages and never actually missing anything.  And I hadn't done my homework--somehow I belived that the first three books were it, not knowing therer was more.  At any rate, I won't be buying the next three, or nine or however many he/she decides to write to drag the story out.  And believe me, I don't often leave a story unfinished.

I wanted to LOVE this...,"I read the pre-release reviews, and already being a fan of Kristen Painter's, I really wanted to love this book.  There is a lot of potential here, but it took much too long to set up, plus it included a lot of repeated phrases. Trust your readers to get it the first time you say it. The second half of the book -- which is where most of the action takes place -- felt rushed, probably because the first half was so long. The trial, while a brilliant idea, was over way too soon, I left like it was built up to be the climax and fell a bit flat. Funny, too, that Donna keeps mentioning a Vampire Handbook, I read one a few years ago called Bite Me: A Practical Guide for Vampires or something like that.

"interesting, but extremely disappointing ending","The wandering contests that the MC joins just didn't seem to work.  And while there was a nice elaborate mystery built into the tale, for me it was another of those author ex machina style twists where the author decided ""I'll do this to both misdirect the reader and provide an excuse for this whole mixed up plot.""<br /><br />Its not a recipe for a plot that is all that compelling to me.  I am demanding when it comes to plot and character, and this story had villains who seemed to purchase their ideas from the same ACME company that Wile E. Coyote uses to purchase all of the malfunctioning goods he fails to catch the roadrunner with.  The ideas just don't make much sense.  it was ""bored immortals mess with some mortal kid because he's not interested in trying for immortality.""<br /><br />Its not a horrible book, and some will enjoy it, but I started reading this series wondering if I'd find it worth it.

I actually gasped when it became clear who the serial killer and arsonist was. They hadn’t been on my radar at all. That was super well done.

"Uneven but haunting, gritty fantasy","Trouble the Saints is an ambitious novel, but one that doesn’t quite reach all of its aspirations. While I was drawn in by the glittering, dangerous world, with its blend of unearthly magics and rich historical reality, as well as by the intriguingly complex characters, the meandering, uneven pace and confusing structure left me cold until the strong ending.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, each from a different character’s perspective, each concerned with a different character's choices and destiny, though all follow the same story. We start with Phyllis LeBlanc, Phyllis Green, Pea, as she is variously known, a world-weary assassin with saint’s hands (the fantastical element that is left unexplained for large swaths of the book, tantalizing but unsatisfied until near the end) that give her supernatural dexterity with knives, a skill she puts to use as a mob boss’s “angel of justice.” In Pea’s part of the story, we meet the other two characters who will take up the storytelling mantle eventually, namely Dev, Pea’s half-Indian erstwhile lover whose magical hands give him the ability to trace threats of danger and violence to himself or others, and Tamara, a dancer with a penchant for fortune-telling and aspirations of being the next Josephine Baker. These three, along with a few other memorable characters, wind their narrative way through Manhattan’s violent underworld, the smaller-scale but no less violent politics of small town upstate New York, and the impending doom of America’s entrance into World War II. But the winding narrative doesn’t lay out a course as easily visible or predicable as that makes it sound, and the off-kilter pacing made it hard to get a grip on the story’s bones for far too long; for example, just as I thought I could see the direction things were taking, what I thought would be the major story line was abruptly resolved, only a quarter into the book. Pea’s narrative would have been more enjoyable if it hadn’t come first, but it’s spent too much in just trying to figure out what’s going on and where we’re going from here, leaving little chance to really get to know Phyllis, the lethal angel, who's been passing for white to work for a white mob.<br /><br />It’s Dev’s turn next, and his section is the messiest of the three, with jumps in time that aren’t signified quite well enough, and a sometimes overly would-be poetic voice that was a bit off-putting. By the time we get to Tamara’s story, on the other hand (pardon the pun), we’ve seen her through Pea’s and Dev’s eyes, and that may be why her character and her story are the easiest to grasp and sink into. Tamara’s character feels the most wholly drawn, her struggles and flaws the most real, shot through with a thread of cohesive characterization that Pea and Dev seem to lack. By this time, too, the stylized language feels deliciously dreamy again, as it did in Pea’s first section but not so much in Dev’s; it feels like it serves a purpose, rather than being vaguely symbol-heavy just for its own sake. By the end of Tamara’s section, which is the end of the book, I felt like I’d finally gotten a hold of what Trouble the Saints really is, and what it’s trying to do, and was far more fond of it than I’d been for the first two thirds. The ending, finally, at last, really got me in its hooks, and felt genuinely earned, satisfyingly tragic, heartbreaking and enraging all at once.<br /><br />Trouble the Saints is ultimately an uneven book, both in the range of quality between its three sections and in the literal pacing of the back-and-forth plotlines, but it’s one that still has a lot of strength in it. The world is captivating, the characters are complicated and sharply drawn, and some of the narrative’s turns of phrases are legitimately exquisite. Its supernatural approach to interracial violence and oppression is both original and fascinating, and gives the whole book an electrifying muscularity despite its slippery plotting and uneven structure. It’s one I’d recommend, albeit with reservations.",3.0,0,2020

While reading this book,  I was talking out loud at the stupidity of the characters.<br />Possible spoilers:  she forgot her sword during danger; she forgot to replace her compositions while being in danger; the leader says, don't split up, and then they split up and are attacked; one says, ""I wish I hid my compositions better"" after being kidnapped (and this wasn't the first kidnapping), in the middle of a battle the opposing sides take time to chat and write compositions; no one picked up a rock to stop the writing of said composition; the characters are distracted by growing attraction when they should be aware of surroundings; At 78% of the book, I was still waiting for something to happen.  It was a book without much of a story and it wasn't about Elena and L.  I also kept getting lost about who was the star of each chapter.  I did NOT enjoy the going back and forth.

This desperately needs an edit. I cannot believe how many errors there are .... spoilers,"since one of the reviewers said it was in good shape.  OW! is written OWE! repeatedly,  and that is just one minor example. And this thing is soooooo looooong. Generally, I like that in a novel, because it gives plenty of time for plots to progress and for characters to grow and develop. However, this this has me exhausted to the point that I may not be able to finish it. I'm at 69 percent (769 pages) now and have been reading pretty much all day....probably close to 12 hours. I did this instead of what I should have been doing, but certainly am not going on with it tonight. I'm not sure ALL the fights have to be in such excruciating detail. Potential romances are stretched out to points where they are tedious, not intriguing. I don't see the point of one character maybe being LGBTQ or maybe not and then pining away for the most unappealing guy in the school. That really does not move either the plot or characters along. There is no rationale for one of the faculty to take such a dislike for the hero...if there is something to happen there, it should have already, at least, been hinted at. Characters are too ready to share secrets.  But mainly, I have to go back to multiple errors per page in some cases. A couple of places, they are so bad and so frequent, it is impossible to figure out what the authors were trying to say.",3.0,0,2020

This is truly an EPIC story!,"I've been an avid fan of dragon stories (and other genres) for many many years. There are good books, bad books and mediocre books. It seems as if I've just been reading the mediocre books for several years now; books that you only finish because you need them to fall asleep.<br />Michael R. Miller's<br />Ascendant - A Dragon Rider Fantasy doesn't fall into any of those categories. This book is an EPIC. From the very first page the reader is drawn into the sounds, smells, and feelings of the characters. I found myself holding my breath at times waiting to read the next words to find where the author was taking me. Ascendant isn't in any way what most dragon stories are. This is so much more. I found myself reading until after midnight and into the early morning hours because I couldn't bear to put the book down. Ascendant isn't your usual dragon story. This is an epic story. The ending isn't what the reader expects or is used to. I can't wait to read the next book to find where the journey will take me. Until then I've gone back and purchased Mr. Miller's previous works. I only wish that there was an option to give it more than 5 stars!",5.0,1,2020
4.5 stars!!,"A paranormal (sci-fi alien) romantic comedy? Even my 90 year old mother thought that was a mouthful.<br /><br />(Wicked thoughts!!)<br /><br />Oh! Where was I? Paranormal (sci-fi alien) romantic comedy. Very few books in my arsenal can boast that. Which was why I had to spend the cash... and it was worth it!!!<br /><br />Jax is a Vandalar male who was enslaved after disappointing three females who deemed him irreparable. Apparently there was something structurally wrong with his penis which could not be ignored. Unfortunately, due to important intel that was lost in translation, Lilly, a single Earther farmer female, ends up buying him after being told he would be a hard worker in her wheat fields. Instead, she got a saikh, a Vandalar who is especially trained in the sexual and household arts to keep his female happy. More like a sex slave who has to share and accept his Vandalar female as his dominate.<br /><br />This isn't necessarily a laugh a minute. It does emphasize the difference between Vandalar males and Earther females, some at levels that was even difficult to understand where it counts. What do Earther women really want? Can a VAndalar male be himself without worrying about how to pleasure his female? And when will Lilly eventually kick him out? This is a different level of angst, one that isn't used as much by writers.<br /><br />It's been a while since I had a chance to thoroughly enjoy a story that was around 200+ pages. In fact, I ended up buying it as I know I will be reading it again, especially before the next in the series comes out!",5.0,1,2020

Not quite what it seems...,"I rarely give a low rating for a book and really try to see what the author was working towards before deciding if it was just my humble opinion that it didn't suit me. That is where my problem happens to be with this story. I have no idea what the ""message"" was and found myself waiting for a few scenarios to come to a conclusion and explain the meaning behind them, but it never happened. One simple example is the idea of unusual red birds appearing and reappearing throughout the book. I have yet to understand why they are a part of this story and can only speculate that the author is afraid of or greatly dislikes birds?<br /><br />This was a book club pick for our group and none of us could really put our finger on why the book took the turn that it did...and did not quite come to a resolution (at least one that we would have appreciated).<br /><br />Somewhat of a SPOILER: There is a part of the book that will disturb those who have suffered sexual abuse and it took one of our group quite by surprise, upsetting her to the point that she could not finish the story. Most of our group agreed that we found the story took an unfortunate turn at that point. Perhaps the author wanted to bring that sort of situation to light, but some of the actions following the abuse seemed a bit absurd...making it less seriously taken.<br /><br />This could've been a great mystery without leaving us feeling so mysteriously confused.",2.0,0,2020
I didn't like the authors writing style,"The book is about three women who were thrown together when all three lost their life savings when swindled by an investment ponzi-like scheme. All they were left with were equal shares in a run-down mansion on a prime piece of property.<br />I really wanted to like this book. The book covers are so pretty and inviting and the ratings for the series's books were good. I was was looking for a light, fun read. Right off I wasn't sure I liked the author’s writing style, such as the way a scene was written or a character's reaction to something. But, that’s ok. If the story and the characters are good then it will work out.<br /><br />But then I got got to chapter nine.<br />Two of the three women had been successful career women and the third had spent her adult life cooking, cleaning, running carpool, raising two children and making a nice, comfortable home for her family. I was shocked that the author chose to write a scene in this way: “So, what do you think?” Madeline asked, putting her fork down on her now-clean plate. “Do we tear down, or take Chase Hardin up on his offer?” There was a silence as Nicole and Avery tried to hide their surprise that the housewife had taken the initiative. Nicole drained the last sweet sip from her glass and waited to see what would happen.”<br /><br />Say what?? I was so stunned that the author would write that scene like that and leave it hanging there. Way to go with women supporting other women's choices. Did that strike a personal nerve? You bet it did. That could have been written so many different ways that would have worked. I finished the chapter, then stopped reading. I decided if that's her writing style then I didn't want to stick around for the way she wrote the upcoming sniping and bickering between the two “love interests”. It would most likely be childish and go on ad nauseam.",2.0,0,2020

Terrible,"This is a hard review to write because this is easily one of the worst books I've ever read.<br /><br />There's really nothing good I can say about this book. So I will calmly list my problems with the book:<br /><br />-Weak characterization. Everyone is flat. Jack is an overpowered comic book villain. If there's such a thing as an Evil Mary Sue, that's what Jack is. Grace is weak, She would rather worry about her sister going to an asylum than she is about her sister dying a very long painful death at the hands of 1980s style sociopath. Everyone else feels like the same character. Even Esther, who I really liked that the end, was not developed well at all.<br /><br />-The author keeps referring to people with bipolar disorder as being ""manic depressive"". I can't tell you the last time the phrase manic depressive was used in a clinical sense to describe bipolar disorder.<br /><br />-At one point the main character wonders if her husband isn't ""homosexual"". Who says that anymore? Homosexual manic depression, did my dead grandmother write this?<br /><br />-Grace is a moron who refused to help herself. If this was based on a true story, as in a non fiction book, these actions would be understandable. Grace is a fictional character. The author could have done so much more with her in this book . This book was begging for an Unreliable Narrator. She could have made grace more active in saving herself. Instead, we get this bag of bones who for most of the novel, who just sits there and does nothing.<br /><br />-The author should have spend some time researching sociopaths. Jack is 1980s version of a sociopath. For characterization of Jack was incorrect and lazy. Jack killing the dog was also really obvious because in the 80s part of the dark tried included sociopaths hurting animals.<br /><br />-Not to mention Jack is seriously overpowered. He's beyond smart, he's beyond handsome, he's perfect! Like I said he comes across as a comic book villain, he's not realistic at all.<br /><br />-Because of the author's use of a past/present style of narration, I wasn't afraid for Grace or her sister.<br /><br />-In the end, the twist isn't even really a twist and is not worth suffering through the rest of the book to get to.",1.0,0,2020

Ingrid's job sends her speak to parents who lost their child, American students  who found a friend dead, a professor who does not stick to instruction , and difficulties the embassy staff has with English government agencies.<br />The story is so detailed, and the action exciting , I could not always  follow  who was really responsible for the  illegal actions.

Really enjoyed,"I have been a fan of the author’s and paranormal fiction for a long time.  I was excited and hesitant to hear about the new line of woman’s paranormal fiction books which had women over 40 as their main characters.  I was worried a bit about how it would be done.  While I have purchased a few of the others Shannan Mayer is my favorite so I started with hers first. I must say, this book did not let me down.  Now while I am about the same age as our main character, I don’t really feel like I am “old” but I enjoyed seeing who she was made to be and start to feel happier with her life. Oh and yeah, she kicked some butt!  I see that the author changed the series name to include “mid-life” in the title. I am not a fan of this but what can you do.

The building of Hades and Sofia’s relationship was enough to carry both books, the kidnapping scene was not warranted. I love the author’s work but this one was a let down. I was glad to see Ash and his willing to help the brother he hates to find his wife. They say tragedies brings people together and it sure did for him and his brother.  Sofia’s decision to leave was way overdue. Your husband working with your rapist is just not biblical. FYI, it pained me to give a less than 4 star review especially to an author I love.",3.0,0,2020
skipped pages of this book; violence and peril at every turn; annoyed while reading,"I finished the book, almost didn't, but will not buy the rest of the series. (especially after reading the reviews - the issues I find in book 1 continue in the series).  I hated the violence and torture. I hated that she saves a man who then steals from her and leaves her alone to face enemies. He's supposed to be a good guy too.  Things didn't add up or make sense. Author throws in naked characters - yet that serves no purpose to the story. When she's tested, everyone is naked. She rescues naked man; she is tortured naked along with another naked man.  I didn't like the parallel plots.  Where is true friendship and love? who do i care for? So many names and plots tossed into the mix so few of them ""stick"".  Afraid to try another book in a different series by this author.  When blocks of description came up, I skipped pages.

Yes, the press became critical of Meghan. Yes, Harry absolutely has a right to be sensitive about the paparazzi. Beyond that - they knew what they were getting into. In return for a  life of great wealth, opportunity, access and service they would make appearances, share the highlights of their lives, and behave like adults. They did not.

One of the best I have read this year.,"I'm from Chicago and old enough to remember what was going on in 1978, the setting for this story.  Mr. Spoelstra must have lived in Chicago because the details are dead on right down to the Chicagoese idioms. Needless to say, this all resonated with me . Beyond the excellent writing, the science part is interesting. This is not the usual go back and kill Hitler to make the current world right. This time travel model is more the block universe type or parallel universes where you can kill your grandfather and still exist. In fact you can go back and meet yourself. No paradoxes to worry about.<br />The plot is basically a love story. Most time travel novels today are written by women who go heavy on the love part but light on the science.  This story has the science and a tender love story that most of us can relate to, you know the do-over part.<br />I enjoyed this book so much, at the end I got sucked into  three chapters of Spoelstra  noir book, Red Chaser about the 1950s. It's not time travel but just as much a page turner.",5.0,1,2020
This is pretty good but…,"I'm only part way through this book but I had to write a review.  I normally do not like first person books, though i do own one series written that way.  This book is one of the few written in the first person voice to resonate with me.  So far, it's well done and I like the characters.  The speaker is a private detective with a cool sense of humor.  I'm enjoying listening to him.  The story is about a complaint of sexual misconduct from a young priest about the senior, respected priest in town.  Ouch.  I like the dialog, there's just enough of it and it feels real so far.  I wouldn't listen to the guy who called this book a turd in his headline.  This is a pretty good book.<br /><br />There is one major flaw.  This author must have written this book with a Dictionary and Thesaurus sitting next to him.  I got tired of looking up words every few pages.  I started writing them down so I could update my review.  Here's just a few of the words used in just a few chapters.<br />Equipoise<br />Tendentious<br />Adumbrated<br />Boosterish<br />Ignoble<br />Pyrrhic<br />Obdurate<br />Arrogated<br />Aureate<br />Stentorian<br />There were many others in the book, before and after these that I didn't write down for this review.  There were also many more 'big' words that I knew and so didn't take note of.  If this poor effort to impress readers won't bother you, then this is actually a good read.

Reads like an op ed,"I have read in excess of 50 various ""hourly history"" style books and this is the only one I have ever rated this low or elected to delete from my library. Everyone agrees that the event was horrible and a blot on the American character.<br /><br />I estimate that more than 50% of the book is used to make derogatory remarks, cite unrelated events and promote other books. The book is actually finished at the 75% completed mark, so maybe less than half is about the actual events on the Trial of Tears.<br /><br />As the author relates ""his version"" of history, events like the French and Indian Wars, that many native American backed the British in the Revolution  and that there were atrocities committed on both sides is left out. All you get is the ""benevolence"" of Native Americans and the racist Europeans.<br /><br />At one point the writer  put forth the idea that the Native Americans were nicer to their slaves than the Europeans- really? A slave is a slave and it's a horrible institution no matter how you treat someone ...plus I don't believe the statement is completely accurate if you look at history more closely. Also mentioned is the idea that yes the Native Americans may have tortured and killed their slaves but not as much as the Europeans?????? What????<br /><br />Large parts of the book reflect the writers hatred for Andrew Jackson. With a very broad brush, the writer, compared Jackson to Hitler.  The writer takes the time to bash Christians even dragging in the Crusades, The Spanish Inquisition, the Texas Revolution,  and the Salam Which Trials!  Distain for the Constitution and America in general is evident throughout the book. At one point the writer even states the Constitution is a racist document.<br /><br />This book is  a poor example of a historical account and more of an opinion piece by the writer on their beliefs on racism, Christianity and the evil of Europeans. I would recommend reading other books for a more balanced look at history without the obvious bias of this writer.",1.0,0,2020

Get him fixed and then take out the low life scum who did it – it may be vengeance but it is also justice as he’s not the only victim of their evil ways… To this end she acquires the assistance of two archangels, takes over the many Hells and totally mesmerizes the previous owner. Anyone who loves Blain’s Satin knows that she is just what he deserves!<br /><br />Although it is linked to both in ‘Whatever For Hire’ and ‘Grave Humor’, you don’t need to read them first.

Becoming aware of how narcissim may have affected you or your family,"This book takes an in depth look into narcissism, delving into technical information while detailing them through the authors personal experiences. The book is well written and organized, almost into textbook form with the amount of information. The author, however, avoids being dry by making it relatable and personal. The information is detailed and will help any reader determine if they might be dealing with narcissism in their childhood, home, or even staring in the mirror. The action steps related to healing can additionally be used for dealing with other types of toxicity in people, not just narcissism. If you think you might be dealing with narcissism internally or in others, this book will help you analyze and determine.",5.0,1,2020
Meh,"I think I’m done with this author. These last few books all suffered from the same things: not a lot of character grown or chemistry, and too much dependence ow/om for personality (or I guess that’s the reason? I really don’t get why) even when it makes absolutely no sense. Each of these books has featured the characters meeting and starting their relationship but then for whatever reason end up sleeping with other people. This heroine was a virgin, at 20 years old, had not even slept with her Fiance, but after sleeping with the hero has a personality transplant and begins sleeping around. How does this makes sense? From virgin to sleeping with multiple random men in the brief few months between the first meeting with the hero and the next is just far fetched. But for some reason it’s really important to the author for the characters to be sleeping around. I just don’t understand, why not just not write a virgin character? I don’t know exactly what the hero was doing, I skimmed out after this. He had been told that she was engaged and believed she was a crap person who cheated so he didn’t really have a reason not to love on. Not to mention that the part of the premise the fact that hero is so dense that he couldn’t tell that the woman he was with was a virgin. Seriously it’s laughable, it didn’t do him any favors either. There wasn’t really a lot else to the plot to me. I’ll be honest after all of the stilted writing and dialogue, when I got to that part I just laughed and then I skimmed a little before deciding to DNF. They had speedster (again) and she on a date with another guy whose description was that he was a loser, yet she was already planning to go home with the guy. At least the author could have made him hot or something? Making him some loser just made her character look pretty pathetic. I was already feeling this was mediocre. There really wasn’t anything else to enjoy at that point.  I’m not sure this author is even capable of writing a book focusing on just the two main characters. They need the crap content to fill in the spots where normal plot would go I guess? That’s just not good writing. At this point this author is officially on my “Authors to avoid” list.",2.0,0,2020

"Inspiring, tragic and hopeful — this is MC, no filter!","Some backstory. It was my high school’s annual choir concert, April of 1995, and it was my turn to sing at the Solo Spotlight, a spot reserved for upperclassmen only. It was the chance for talented students to show their singing chops on the stage alone. I signed up for it because — why not? I wasn’t much of a singer, but the choir had taught me how to sing on key, with some “full voice"" chops to boot. I have no clue what “full voice” means, but I assume it’s a good thing? Anyway. Four people sang solo that night, and I was the last one. I never did this kind of thing. I never sought attention or adulation. On the contrary, I went out of my way to be as inconspicuous as possible, an it’s-like-watching-paint-dry type of girl, and I say that with pride, thank you very much! But not that night. That night I stepped on the stage, gazed at the choir director and an audience of about 500 people, and sang Mariah Carey’s cover version of “Without You.” It was just me and a prerecorded piano accompaniment, created to fit my range because, of course I can’t sing like Mariah, duh! When I belted out the last part (“I can’t give anymore”), I gave it all I could, and not only did I nail the song, I got a standing ovation. A standing ovation! My family, friends, fellow choir members, and almost everyone else in the auditorium loved it. I never forgot that moment. I don’t talk about it often, but I do remember it from time to time, and it still makes me smile. That was the day I realized that I was meant to fulfill my creative pursuits. God blessed me with various talents and — despite my introversion — the courage to pursue them.<br /><br />As I read THE MEANING OF MARIAH CAREY, I remembered how much I loved her music growing up. When I was a teen, I took the bus to the mall and bought her CDs on their release date! I saw something special in her, and it wasn’t just her gorgeous vocals and melancholy songs. I connected with this singer, even though I’d never met her. Whenever she sang about not belonging, about being on the outside looking in, or about feeling alone and misunderstood — those songs resonated with me. They still do, now more than ever. This memoir touches on her tough childhood and her dysfunctional family. It’s about growing up bi-racial in Long Island. Yikes. Long Island is NOTORIOUSLY racist! But she goes into more detail about her family, especially her mother and two siblings. It breaks my heart that her mother turned out to be so toxic. I thought they had a close relationship, but everything in the book made sense. We also get details of her awful marriage to Tommy Mottola, and how this guy handled her career and their marriage like some wannabe Italian mobster. I feel sorry for Thalia (his current wife). Not only is Thalia a Mini-Me version of Mariah, but her career as a telenovela princess-slash-Latin music diva vanished shortly after her marriage to Mottola. (Or maybe she's truly happy with this dude. We’ll never know.) We also get Mariah’s take on the Glitter scandal, her emotional (and psychological) breakdown, the TRL incident, and her whirlwind romance with Derek Jeter and Luis Miguel.<br /><br />Mariah opens her heart in this memoir. It is well written. Mariah is a writer (she wrote most of her songs), but I don’t know if she wrote this book herself or if she hired a ghostwriter. In any event, this is her story, and she got to tell it without the media and other sources getting in the way. Most celebrity memoirs come off as salacious and yellowish, a cry for attention, but this one is more or less an exception. I say “more or less,” because the book has its can’t-believe-she-went-there moments, which brings me to the downsides. She still refers to Jennifer Lopez as the “woman I don’t know,” or words to that effect. Whenever the media brings up J. Lo, Mariah would playfully — albeit maliciously — say, “I don’t know her,” and leaves it at that. I get it. She doesn’t want to talk about J. Lo. She doesn’t want to address the whole “Loverboy” versus “I’m Real” fiasco. It’s been talked about ad nauseam. (Just so we’re clear though, we’re talking about a sample here. As in sampling parts of someone else’s song. It was neither Mariah nor J. Lo’s to claim, just saying.) But come on! Does she think J. Lo rubbed her hands together in glee and stole the sample out of malice? It would be great to see Mariah and J. Lo put crowns on each other and forget about this pointless twenty-year-old feud once and for all. I hate to say it, Ms. Carey, but it’s time to move on. But, alas, divas be diva-ing, I guess. (And, yes, I love J. Lo. She inspired me to tone my bod and look my best. So I’m the tiniest bit biased!) The beginning and middle parts of the book (her childhood and her marriage to Mottola) remind me of JANE EYRE — with a touch of Daphne du Maurier's REBECCA (the culmination of Sing Sing). These rags-to-riches stories are a far cry from the Cinderella story we thought Mariah had.<br /><br />I still enjoyed this book. I knew I connected with Mariah for a reason. I, too, had a rough childhood and I, too, have worked hard for my dreams. My novels (and other project endeavors) bring joy into my life, and it was worth the struggles. I, like Mariah, found peace and solace in Jesus Christ, and no relationship compares with the relationship with the Almighty. Again, I enjoyed this book. I appreciate Mariah’s music all the more, and it brought back the beautiful memory of that high school auditorium. I am strong, determined and can dodge obstacles like a boss, and it began way back in high school, as I sang a Mariah Carey-inspired song.

"Sleep, riches, and health to be truly enjoyed must be interrupted.  ~ Johann Paul Friedrich Richter","Sleep, riches, and health, maybe … but a marriage proposal interrupted?<br /><br />“A Timely Elopement” opens with Fitzwilliam Darcy at the parsonage beginning his avowal of love and admiration to Miss Elizabeth Bennet.  His cousin, everyone’s favorite Colonel, interrupts with news:  their cousin, Anne de Bourgh has eloped with George Wickham.<br /><br />Wickham’s motivations are obvious but what could possibly motivate Anne to this extreme?  Where is the couple now?<br /><br />Elizabeth has no opportunity to refuse a proposal that only almost happens.  But through the men’s discussion of Wickham, she learns just what a scoundrel her former favorite is.  Her response must wait until later as the Collinses return home in dire straits.

Not my cup of whiskey,"I've read this author before and I wasn't too fond of the book, but I thought I would give it another shot. Let me start with this, I loved Calvin. He was everything that strong and silent type hero needs to be. But Piper and Preston's their childish and immature behavior was too much to handle. Everything seemed not sincere. I'm not a reader who can really stop in the middle of the book. The writing wasn't horrible, but I felt no real connection to the characters.

A Hunter and his prey,"I have never once been disappointed when I enter the mind of Ms. Shen, she truly knows how to capture my attention beyond anything.<br /><br />We only got small snippets of Hunter in the All Saints High books and can I say how I just love him so damn much!!!! I know his upbringing isn't foreign to those in similar circumstances, but his true belief that he was the ultimate outsider in his family was heartbreaking.<br /><br />Meeting Sailor for the first time was a true treasure. Especially her trying to save a young Hunter in a hail storm. Her drive to wanting to be an Olympic athlete was so commendable. But being a wallflower by choice was how she built a wall around herself.<br /><br />I enjoyed Sailor's interactions with her parents and wanted to strangle Hunter's. Watching them discover their strengths together, completely different than what they originally thought. Hunter has a filthy mouth and a fabulous sense of humor. Sailor can put you in your place with an arrow straight to your heart (LITERALLY! 😂😂😂). I enjoyed it tremendously. You will too!!!",5.0,1,2020

asexual main character makes story drag and drag.,"No, he's not really asexual, but the author clearly doesn't know how to write a teen boy character as anything other than a sexless wimp unable to consider the possibility that ""Hey, that girl wants me.""<br /><br />And of course, as I complained about books 1 and 2, Angst, nothing but angst.  And angst is BORING.  Especially after 2 full books of it.  Its like Volke is not allowed to grow in confidence or knowledge or experience or guts or......  (He just doesn't change, he's the scared five year old boy he was when he was turned over to the gravekeeper as an orphan 11 years before the events in this book.)<br /><br />I think the reason I feel strongly about this story is I WANT to like the main character.  I WANT to feel like I'm cheering him on, but he's horribly written and thought out.<br /><br />He lies when the truth would clearly serve him better.<br />He avoids conflict until it grows worse.<br />He accepts every authority figure's demands even when a normal teenager would rightly stand up for himself.<br />He can't seem to realize that girls exist, except when its time to freak out about his sister Illia and if she still will talk to him.  (But he has no concept that she might want to be his partner/mate.)<br /><br />He's 16, but acts like he hasn't hit twelve most of the time.<br /><br />The plot is extremely good, and if the characters didn't act like sexless mannequins most of the time, I'd argue that they are well thought out.  But the fact that the author goes out of her way to play the ""I refuse to allow my teenage characters to have relationships, but they can angst about them to add pages"" game drags this to a low 3 star tale overall.  Honestly, this will probably end my reading on any story by this author.  I don't want a dumb harem fantasy where the female characters barely wear clothing and the male jumps from girl to girl like a bee jumps from flower to flower, but any story of teenagers of opposite sex can't pretend that relationships don't happen either.",3.0,0,2020
Shares the dungeon core genre's greatest flaw,"This is by many standards a well written book.  It has a good plot, is solid grammatically and the flow of the reading is quick.  If I was just looking at it academically, it would receive a very high grade.<br /><br />Sadly, in my experience dungeon core novels run into a rather simple problem.  And its been one that I've found rather consistent.  The essence of the tale is that a sentient spirit ends up in charge of a system that can create rooms and beings/monsters to defend the rooms.  The spirit in many of these tales has a physical ""body"" that does not move and usually has no more than one companion, who is often equally immobile.  Defend and Conquer is firmly in this category as the core is the remnants of a former human brain.  The brain was removed and placed in the center of a mechancial/computer unit that runs the new base.<br /><br />There is a bit more, but that starts the tale, and creates my issue.  There is just no real interaction.  The core does have talks with its AI assistant, but those are almost all about research and building and exploitation of resources.  There is no soul in these entities and the enemy appears to be equally faceless and lacking in personality.  Its like there are no characters in this tale.<br /><br />And I tend to be fairly demanding in wanting characters and seeing them develop.  So while this is not poorly written, it definitely falls into the low 3 star ranks for me.  I just can't get into a tale that feels so lacking in what I consider the most important element in making a story entertaining.<br /><br />Lovers of the genre who can enjoy a tale without characters will disagree with me, but if you want characters in your tale, this isn't for you.",3.0,0,2020
Harsh,"Harsh raw worlds, run by wars and politics, by rich people who will never die. Souls and memory stored digitally, and death just means having to worry if you can afford the next body, or 'sleeve'. Except for the rich, who can grow their own clones, ready to put on like clothing when they wished.<br /><br />And in this harsh reality, a 'Meth', or Methusila, is murdered, and when his backup is restored, missing the last 24 hours of his life, he's pissed. He can't believe he'd kill himself, so he 'hires' Takeshi Kovacs to find his murder.<br /><br />With Bladerunner bleakness, old Earth is full of those who'd be dying, if Real Death were even a thing anymore. An interesting take, and some good (if ugly) world building. The violence is pretty graphic, and unlrelenting at times, but not only the mystery pulled me in, but watching Takeshi work as well. The character was interesting enough to keep my interested, even through the story's most violent scenes.",4.0,1,2020
A wonderful romantic cozy mystery series!,"I am really enjoying reading through this series! I have been binge reading it for a few evenings now. I am about 2/3 of the way finished and find myself hurrying through chores to get back to the series as soon as possible.

Biblical call for honest self-evaluation,"I already considered myself a moderate, having changed from Republican to Libertarian, but this book still had provoking points that caused me to reevaluate many of my political ideas. I appreciated the author's heart, his transparency of his own transformation, and the fact that the author did not call for any political party jumping. He is calling for honest and sincere self-evaluation that leads to peaceful discourse. I agree with the author. Let there be an end to the slander and hostility from Christians of all sides. Don't expect others to change. You change first. Reflect the Master you claim, not the religious elites He denounced. At the same time, do not call what is evil good, and good evil.<br /><br />You do not have to be defined by your political party. You don't have to consume and regurgitate everything your political party says.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br /><br />""As Christians, the entire concept of nationalism should be completely bewildering to us.

Gripping!,"Wow! What a fantastic read, that only lost half a star because of my one criticism (and apparently the private detective's in the story).<br />Alice has her heartbroken when her boyfriend of six years proposes. They set a date a year down the line and a week before the wedding he calls off the marriage. She is left to pick up the pieces, then cope with the death of her parents. She inherits a large sum of money and isn't looking for romance when she meets the charming Dominic aka Ben aka Greg. He is a con artist, criminal and mastermind identity thief of note. He proposes a month after they meet and she says ""yes"". This is the part that lost the book half a star. One would think that having been burned badly by her former fiance and as an astute businesswoman running her own catering company, she'd be more careful. He insists they marry within the next two months and she agrees.<br />He is a charming manipulator who continues committing crimes including several murders whenever something threatens to possibly reveal who he really is. It started out with him on datings apps, meeting women and forcing himself on them. Enter Holly. A lawyer by profession who opts to work as a prostitute (as it pays as well for fewer hours) who reports ""Ben"" and he is blocked from all dating apps. He resorts to old fashioned dating but his rough manner results in the death of a waitress, which necessitates that he leaves Australia asap. He heads for the UK via Germany where perchance he meets Alice in a lift. He has stolen the identity of a man parked outside preparing for an interview and she is attempting to win the Company's catering contract.<br />The rest forms the bulk of the story and raises the question ""Do you ever really know who you're marrying?"".

Epic conclusion!,"December 10th, 2014, I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. I was in a coma for 6 days and had been hospitalized for 2 weeks. I had read Vera's work before - namely, the Cobweb Bride - and was notified of new work from her when I got home. I bought Qualify and loved it. I was vulnerable and so fragile at that point in my life. I had lost my daughter who was stillborn that year and had lost a good friend. Gwen's strength lent me strength. There were so many parallels between us, and I clung to it. Gwen was fighting for her life, and so was I. Compete was next. My marriage was falling apart and I didn't know myself anymore. This was a period of change and growth for me, just as it was for Gwen. Again, she kept me sane and stable. Then came Win. I had been toying with the idea of seeking help for my addiction for some time at this point, but I was terrified and I had no support. Win helped me to make that decision. If Gwen could get through the games, I could beat addiction. I'd decided. I would do it. After Win came my TAG tattoos. Shoelace Girl, and the Eye of Horus. Shoelace Girl to remind me of my inner Gwen, and the eye of Horus to remind me that my Aeson is out there, and I will always be protected in my journey. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't read Survive until I had gone to rehab and gotten clean. January 3rd, 2020, Survive was released, and it just so happened to be my 90 days clean.

New beginnings for the Colony,"I’ve read a few of these Interstellar Bride books, and honestly it’s really hit or miss for me. Sometimes I like them sometimes I don’t. Think one was probably a 3-3.5 star read for me, but I round up.  So this was book one of I’m assuming a spin off. To be honest I haven’t read enough of these to know the plot that seems to wind throughout the series. But from what I gathered, this spin off is about cyborgs, or rather mostly alien cyborgs. And of course them getting brides.<br />Things I liked:<br />I liked the whole concept of being outcasts, and them trying to build a home of their own. It’s actually really sad to see how these soldiers families all turned their backs on them because they were captured by the enemy and turned into cyborgs. So of course everyone on the colony is kind of angry/sad/depressed. I like that there is an emotional component to the story. I liked that this didn’t come across as being forced, I mean yes, Rachel picked this because she didn’t have any other good option, but at the same time they guys didn’t back her into a corner like they do in a lot of these types of books. I liked that the guys immediately went along with what she felt, respecting her wishes. I also in general just really liked Rachel, I felt like she was more developed as a character than the others. She’s also a strong person with morals who is both tenacious and smart.<br />Things I didn’t like:<br />I wish they guys had a little bit more development, I mean I got their backstory in a few paragraphs, and they you find out a tad more about their families late in the book, but both of those things are explained very quickly. You don’t get to know the guys nearly as well as you do Rachel, and I think if you did you would pull more for them all. I didn’t love how quick Rachel jumped in, I mean she was open to the idea, but I figured she would have taken more time to get used to them and the massive change but she didn’t. Also the book is a tad quicker read than I normally like, but other than that those are my only complaints.",4.0,1,2020

Slow crawl,"I am so glad that I didn't pay full price for this. What a remarkably tedious novel!<br /><br />I learned 100 times more about the creative process than I ever wanted to learn, down to an entire chapter devoted to the inspiration behind a picture for an album cover. It was all the members of the band standing on top of a mountain. What in the world was so groundbreaking about that image lol. Entire chapters devoted to the inspiration for a song, usually about the attraction between Billy and Daisy.<br /><br />Nearly the entire premise of the book was about the unfulfilled, never truly acted upon attraction between Billy and Daisy. So, essentially, this book is about a romance that never happened among characters that never existed. You couldn't even muster up the enthusiasm to despise the characters for their sordid, drug addled actions.<br /><br />Daisy's character was pretty much a caricature of a rock star, basically just fluff. Had all the other characters been written as well as Billy's part, it might have succeeded. He was the only one that seemed to have genuine emotion and well fleshed out.<br /><br /> You just couldn't really care much about Daisy in the beginning and still didn't by the end.

It is a good book, but it would be better if the user learns to read basic music tabulature.  There are hundreds of songs with basic music notation for free all over the internet.  She downloaded flute and guitar music that showed basic note.  The kalimba tabulature limits you to learning whatever songs someone bothers to convert into K tabs.  Within a week she was able to plunk the K keys just looking at the music.  Now she is progressing to simple chords and the music is beautiful.  Pretty damn amazing.  She has a cheap piano keyboard her brother got for Christmas a couple of years ago and never touched.  She can relate the simple sheet music to the piano keys and may be trying to learn the piano.  The kalimba is pretty cool all by itself.  After a month the kid can play a bunch of songs without using the sheet music or looking at the keys.  I don't think the she is a musical genius -  the kalimba combined with simple flute or guitar music is just too simple.  If the kalimba has decent tone and resonance, it just sounds great no matter how you play it.  My mother-in-law says it sounds like a ""heavenly harp"" - go figure.  If you can't figure it out, go back to watching TV.",3.0,0,2020
Great suspense,"Lord, blame weights down a heart and blinds our eyes.'<br /><br />Taya McGill,  a forensic anthropologist, has uncovered a body and minutes later finds herself the target of a killer.  She is now on the run with an undercover ATF agent.  Keegan Stryker has to figure out how to keep Taya safe as well as himself before they are both silenced by ruthless killers.<br /><br />Sharee Stover once again brings her readers a non-stop, action filled story.  I was all in from the first and read it in less than a day.  I love stories that include criminal justice and forensics and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Now I'm sad I've finished it.

Poland finally gets to tell their side,"Finally, a book that actually explains Poland's attempted defense against Germany, rather than just glossing over it. I really enjoyed this book. It was thoughtfully-written, well-researched, and presented in a manner that made it interesting for the reader.<br /><br />I've read a good few WWII histories, and even some of the more comprehensive studies do not devote much space to the incidents related to the invasion of Poland, at least not from the Polish point of view, so this book was refreshing. I learned quite a lot about the first few days of the invasion and feel this would be an excellent book for history teachers to use when giving a more complete overview of the early events that led to WWII. Of course, this book is also great for anyone with a general interest in this period or Poland.<br /><br />This book pulls together the facts that aren't discussed very often, as well as the kind of humanistic stories that remind you that war is more than something that happens between governments. You get to experience the loss and heartache, the confusion and displacement up close when you read this book. Perhaps we could all use a dose of that right now.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher, provided through Netgalley. All opinions are my own.",5.0,1,2020
"It was simple, but managed to be fun","Most of these LitRPG/Post Apoc tales follow some rather simple rules.  This one doesn't stray much from the basics although it does start long after the initial start of the changes.  By the time we reach page 1 we are years in the future and humanity is barely surviving after the monsters drove them underground.  Now a desperate woman on a last ditch journey to provide food for the people sheltering in one cave rediscovers just how humanity fought back.<br /><br />Of course it involved killing monsters for power and  then leveling  up skills with that power.  Add in a very punishing alchemy system and you have a high intensity story.  it actually was interesting as poor Avery kept running into monsters with greater and greater power.<br /><br />There were elements that I have issues with (see after conclusion - Spoilers), but overall the story manages to flow and keep interest despite the character development being largely ignored.  It doesn't try to be more and in the end I felt happy enough to finish the tale.<br /><br />So its a low 4 star for me.  Better than many in the genre.  I can't call it an instant classic, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Spoilers after this point.<br /><br />My main issue was some of the discoveries about Venators.  It was kept until act 3, but it felt almost lifted from the manga Claymore where someone who gains too much power ends up turning on their own.  The heroine here vows to stop it (in a future volume), but I ended up just not liking this plot twist.  I can't easily pin down my complaint.  I know part of it is the dehumanizing of a character that is implied.  It also felt like it was there to provide intensity to the plot when there were enough obstacles in the way of the heroine.  I'm not saying that I won't try book 2, but this reduced my interest.<br /><br />I also had a smaller dislike of just how hostile and negative many of the humans were.  Even when offered fair compromises or even unfair ones in their favor too many of the authority figures in this tale did dumb things.  I'd like to see more characters who work together rather than turn into instant problems because the plot appears to demand it.",4.0,1,2020
"decent start, but writing is careless...","There are not just typos and errors with punctuation and grammar, but with time and sequence. When they are doing something Saturday, they are talking about ""tomorrow"" being Monday, (lawyers don't generally do) depositions on Sunday) and she wouldn't be watching TV with all the work she had to do if the stuff was due the next day. Besides,  they'd already said the deposition was on Monday. I'm not very far in it, but have no motivation to read more. A heroine who is pushing 30 is okay, even good, but she is a professional and has the speech patterns and thought patterns of a kid. For that matter, so do the other characters so far.",3.0,0,2020
Wait Till Helen Comes,"Twelve year old Molly and her blended family move out to the country. Heather, Molly's seven year old step-sister, witnessed her mother die in a fire and now suffers from the untreated emotional fallout of the loss. While dealing with the stresses of a newly blended family and Heather's PTSD, a ghost of a little girl named Helen has come to claim Heather, and Molly must do whatever it takes to stop Helen and save Heather.<br /><br />This setting in this book is spectacular for a middle grade book. The author really goes out of the her way to create a beautiful and creepy setting for the book.<br /><br />The book really is scary even as an adult. It's not just Helen's lonely and sad ghost, it's the reminder something horrible can happen to the youngest and most vulnerable among us. It also speaks to how trusting children are and how that trust can be abused and exploited.<br /><br />The characters are completely believable to the point where, as an adult, I was frustrated with the behavior of Jean and Dave, the parents. I love how Molly never gives up on Heather, no matter how unlikable Heather becomes and how bad Heather treats Molly and her brother Michael. Helen is also a great villain, she's multi dimensional and sympathetic.<br /><br />The author does a great job of setting up a middle grade domestic thriller. This might have been the book that made me fall in love with domestic thrillers.<br /><br />I loved this book as a kid. I was 11 or 12 when I read it. The ending still makes me cry. I think kids who like ghosts and other spooky things would love this book. It is morbid at times, as it deals with death of both children and adults. Someone also briefly mentions nuclear war, because it was the 80's.<br /><br />When I first read this book I was in sixth grade and James Taylor had just released ""Never Die Young"", an appropriate song for this book. I recommend listening to that song will you read this book.",5.0,1,2020

Writing Seemed Off,"I love Ted Bell and the Alex Hawks series.  I was excited the book was released and jumped right in for a new adventure.

"Rushed, and it shows","This book wasn't edited at all. It's full of typo's, there are sentences with words missing, with the wrong word instead of a similar word. ""Eld"" instead of ""old"", ""outs in the world"" instead of ""out in the world,"" etc. It clearly didn't even get a basic proof reading.<br /><br />The plot is equally rushed. Entire scenes from popular movies are ported over for the protagonist to walk through, while hat-tipping that he knows what they're from. People from other worlds ""accidentally"" say entire scenes of dialogue from Earthly movies or books. It's very tedious.<br /><br />On the good side, some parts of the story take a massive leap forward in this installment, which I appreciate, but others just stagnate. The author introduces a new character from Earth and seems to forget she's living in the hero's apartment for about 200 pages. Nothing is really accomplished with the kobolds. Nothing happens with the guild worth mentioning, etc.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is just the hero wandering the city looking for various people, finding them, and then doing nothing with that information. Also, bizarrely at one place in the book he permanently loses 50 HP and doesn't seem to notice or care. Characters disappear and no one cares. Characters die and people just shrug. The hero is trying desperately to figure out the rules that Earthlings have to abide by in this world, meets a girl from Earth, and doesn't ask her. Meets 2 more people who have been to Earth, doesn't ask them either. Etc. It's just poorly plotted out.<br /><br />The whole thing just feels rushed and tbh I am not excited about picking up the next one in October.",3.0,0,2020

A feel-good revelation; 10 stars,"I wish I had discovered this book sooner. It came as a revelation to me, because it deals with something that even high-achieving people, like Gloria Steinem, can neglect: Our self-esteem. Gloria Steinem had to overcome a lot of disadvantages in life, and she did so without bitterness and anger, and she remained positive. But she did have to make efforts to feel good about herself, and her ability to do that has made her one of the most positive feminists in public life. How we feel about ourself is a huge part of our lives, and it can affect our quality of life immeasurably. I read this book very slowly, a little at a time, because I didn't want to lose any of its hard-won wisdom. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel happier, and more in control of their lives.

AWE-some and inspiring!,"I don’t remember how I happened upon this book.<br />It has taken me a year to read, since I took a break between Crook’s time in Arizona and his time in Wyoming and the Dakotas.<br />History, and especially history focusing on the subjugation of the Indians had never held a particular interest for me until I read this book.<br /> I was completely in awe of the superb writing and descriptions of land and people, regardless of the location. Sometimes I would read a page or even just a paragraph and simply savor the writing. Then I marveled at the manner in which General Crook operated from his management of the mules to the troops to his ability to be admired and respected by his troops and his “foes”. He learned from the Indians, be they the many sub-tribes of the Apaches or the Shoshone and Sioux.<br />Crook was efficient, kind and even gentle, and it is clear that Bourke, the author, was intimately familiar with all aspects of General Crook’s dealings and life. Bourke does not insert himself not his own ego into the narrative. He sees himself as a chronicler, a journalist.<br />The book was clearly written for the era in which the author lived, for his contemporaries. His long lists of participants in military would include names familiar to many living then. I was disappointed that so little detail was given about Custer but Bourke states that he only glanced over the massacre because it was public knowledge.<br />This book has inspired me to read more both about the era and the locations it took place, particularly since we now winter in Arizona and have driven through the Yellowstone, the Badlands and the areas in the north that are covered by Crook’s engagements.<br />I highly recommend this book even to those not specifically interested in the subject, and I am grateful to the Digital History Books for making this tome available to us over a century later.<br />My only negative comment concerns about the lack of maps that show me where the events took place. I will have to go to a large library to find those maps and will certainly do so.",5.0,1,2020
Quick read but we'll worth it,"This is a quick read with great photos.  I was intrigued with the idea of a careless bird being cared for and raised by a family and how it affected the family's life.  Cameron, the husband, quickly tells the story of their courtship, marriage,  personalities, and adventures before the magpie comes into their lives.  He explains the horrific accident in Thailand that leaves his wife in a horrible.and terrifying state.  Then Cameron tells of his wife's struggles to deal with her new body mentally and physically.  Up to this point.there aren't many of his wife's photos, especially not facial shots.  But one of the things that really made this story pop was the photography.  It really helped tell the story.  The last section was from the wife Sam who very succinctly said how she felt at different stages after the accident, and in my opinion, was particularly exact in telling the reading what he will be experienced if their loved one experiences a similar fate as hers.  She gives a list of things for the caretaker and friends to say and not say, as well as things to do and not.do.  I truly enjoyed this book.",5.0,1,2020

A delightful story,"I discovered the Agatha Christie novels back in my mid 20's, and I was hooked after finishing the first one, which was one of her Miss Marple mystery novels.

Favorite,"Fingersmith is one of my all-time favorite novels. That I liked it so much is what made Tipping the Velvet harder to heap praise upon. Fingersmith has it all--a good sense of setting--nothing that blatantly announced that it was a modern-day sentiment placed in the past. It has vividly drawn characters, great description of place, and the plotting is superb. I was looking for a book to teach for a class, so even though I'd read it before and thought it wouldn't fit my theme, I decided to take a look at it again. I almost never re-read novels.

Heartwarming,"This was my first M/M read, and to be honest, I didn't know that was what it was until I think chapter 3, but by then I was committed. I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to get into the romance aspect of the story, but it was very tastefully done and the love Zach and Greyson found in each other was evident. I really liked Zach and Greyson. Both characters are relatable, kind-hearted, and trying to make a life for themselves. Family was a strong theme throughout and I loved how even through the ups and downs they were all there for each other. Zach and his family were the ultimate definitions of love and sacrifice for family. Greyson and his family, while unconventional, were there for each other ultimately. This entire story was really well done, and I found myself crying several times, overcome with the emotions Zach and Greyson were experiencing.  If you have not read any of the series, some major themes in this book are music, drugs, dealing with recovery, trust, family, coming out, and of course my favorite, love.",4.0,1,2020

Good recipes even if not following Whole30 ...,"I'm not doing Whole30 -- but I'm always looking for cookbooks that feature fast/easy recipes made from whole ingredients, and this book does just that.<br /><br />""Whole foods"" to me are the ones that you find mostly around the perimeter of the supermarket -- fresh produce, dairy/butter/eggs, meat, poultry, seafood, etc.  And putting together a tasty nutritious meal using just a few of those isn't that complicated.<br /><br />Every time I review a cookbook, I make at least three recipes from the book to get a sense of how the recipes are structured, level of detail, etc.  I did the same with this one, and I found no major issues with the way the material is presented.<br /><br />The first recipe I tried was the Sheet Pan Shrimp with Sesame Broccoli.  I cut the recipe in half (I'm single, live alone, and cook for one person 99% of the time.  This was the first time I'd used coconut aminos and it is indeed very close to soy sauce in flavor although a little sweeter.  I followed the recipe exactly -- broccoli cooked first, then added the shrimp for another 10 minutes.  I had enough for two servings so i had one for supper and the other the next day for lunch, reheated gently in the microwave.  Nice dish, will definitely make again.<br /><br />The next dish was the Seared Salmon Filets with Ginger Caramelized Pineapple.  Again, I halved the recipe to make 2 servings.  I live in a part of the country where fresh salmon is abundant and not too expensive, so I have it often (usually once a week).  For this recipe, I used fresh pineapple .  Another winner.  I think it really needs the green onion at the end to cut through some of the sweetness of the pineapple -- or possibly a bit of diced jalapeño would do it.  I'll play with it the next time I make this.<br /><br />The third recipe was the Spicy Seared Chicken with Watermelon-Spinach Salad.  The chicken is seared with some seriously spicy-garlicky rub.  I used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts for this and cooked both of them at the same time, reserving one for another serving the next day.  Then I made the salad with 1/2 the listed ingredients.  It has a plain oil-and-vinegar dressing, but the spice and garlic in the chicken adds a kick, and the watermelon provides just the right amount of cooling.  I might try adding something to the dressing (lime juice? I think it needs a little acid and more flavor than just vinegar).<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite happy with this book.  There are only a handful of the recipes that I know I won't make --- most of the rest are interesting enough that I'll probably use them at some point.  Solid four stars: I like it!",4.0,1,2020

Barely Able To Hang On....”By A Thread”,"I am a true and loyal fan of author Lucy Score’s novels. That is what makes it SO difficult for me to say that this is by no means even remotely one if her best works. As a matter of fact, I was very close to giving this story two stars if it wasn’t for the conclusion and the two epilogues.<br /><br />Here are the reasons why this story doesn’t make the cut:<br />• The first one third of the book felt like it was on a loop... over and over again readers were forced to be subjected to Dominic’s desire for Ally but stopping due to company policy. Instead we were also forced to read about his frequent hard-one and masturbation scenes. Really... you are 44 years old, not 14!!!<br />• Ally kept her struggles paying for her father’s Memory Care Home a secret for way too long! What’s the big deal?<br />• The sex scenes between Dominic and Ally were raunchy. I’m not a prude by any means but the descriptive sex was not love making but was down right unsettling.<br />• It lacked the character development and heart that Lucy  Score is so skilled at developing.<br />• Too predictable and far too little good, witty bantering.<br /><br />It wasn’t until the story wound down that the author’s talent displayed itself in print. But.... that is kind of late since it was such a LONG book.<br />To make matters worse, the Audible companion is SO expensive. It was well narrated but I found myself listening in the car and apologizing to the great Sebastian  York for having to narrate THIS story. 😳😬<br /><br />My advice to you, Lucy..... write less books and give readers the quality, creative stories that you are known and loved for.

"Inventive, brilliant, metafictional portal fantasy with Shakespearean flair","Jo Walton's newest novel, Or What You Will, is inventive, original, fantastical in every sense of the word, richly referential, and a fascinating read from start to finish. It tells the story of a story, threading together the biography of award-winning fantasy novelist Sylvia Harrison, facing her own mortality and what she will leave behind, and Sylvia's work in progress, a Shakespeare-influenced fantasy set in an Italian Renaissance world in which she last wrote decades earlier. Both stories weave in and out of one another through the voice of an unnamed impish narrator, Sylvia's imaginary friend and muse. This muse is facing his own mortality along with Sylvia's, since, if someone dies, what happens to the characters trapped inside their minds? Unlike Sylvia, though, our narrator has a plan to avoid mortality altogether.<br /><br />Walton's splendidly metafictional work takes the architecture of a novel and opens it up for everyone to see. Everything that inspires a character or plot twist or detail of setting, every piece of research that goes into crafting a pseudo-historical fantasy world - it's all laid bare before the reader, with the fantasy novel a translucent film on top of the suddenly visible bones of reality, research, history both personal and global, of literary tropes and personal biases, of all the pieces of reality that feed into even - perhaps especially - the most fantastical of stories.<br /><br />Late into the book, Walton, via her nameless narrator, describes a pair of portraits which feature cartoons on the reverse side of the canvas. The narrator remarks on the museum’s new display for them, which reveals those reversals, saying, “It’s strange and delightful to see a picture you have seen a thousand times, and suddenly be able to see the secret hidden behind it.”<br /><br />This is the spirit of Or What You Will: the strange and delightful magic of reading a fantasy book, a story with all the story tropes and character archetypes and world-building conventions so familiar to fantasy readers, and suddenly have it unfold into a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the author’s inner workings, the wealth of research that informs every tiny reference or choice, the realities that inspire the fantasies. Yet Or What You Will is not just a documentary on how a fantasy novelist writes her books, just as the drawings on the portraits’ flip sides are not merely a sketch for the better-known front. It weaves the overt contextualization and exposed structure of real history and “real” author biography in and out of the fantastical, but typical enough for easy recognition, story of dukes and wizards and portal crossings from one world to another. Each is enhanced by the other, the suddenly revealed secret side casting the better-known front in a new, starker, light, and the carefully crafted fantasy rendering what might be the dull history of a city’s paving stones and wall repairs and a bleak personal biography of abuse into a copper-bright piece of magic.<br /><br />The thread tying these two worlds together, the canvas between them, is the narrative voice, Sylvia’s imaginary friend and muse, the frequently recurring character - her nameless messenger of the gods. His (to arbitrarily select a gender) presence is constant, as he is the narrator, but occasionally forgotten, when the reader is lulled back into the usual feeling of reading a book, passively offered by a non-personalized provider of words. Then he re-emerges, to remind us that he’s always been there - after all, the story is being told, so someone is telling it. When the text directs the reader to “Imagine spending a day there...” that imperative comes from someone. The judgment of “All Italian ingredients are better than ingredients anywhere else,“ the artistic appraisal of a well-described sunset or scoop of gelato, are not somehow objective or universal - there is a voice, and therefore a consciousness, behind it all. This isn’t a new twist Walton came up with for Or What You Will - this is how novels, written in this common narrative voice, work, whether we take that narrative voice for the author, some god or providence in the characters’ world that controls their fates, or this muse of fire, a Greek chorus relating and commenting on the action, but no less present and capable of agency and independent thought for all that.<br /><br />It’s an approach that I’ve seen more often done in theatre, which is in some ways its natural home (perhaps one reason why the fantasy world in Harrison’s story leans so much on Shakespeare’s oeuvre) and somewhat less frequently in literature, but for a book that so relishes its referential nature, let’s have a few references: Or What You Will is reminiscent of Calvino, of Oyeyemi, of Stoppard and Sondheim (sorry, back to theatre), of Edward Eager in his enthusiastic in-text gratitude toward E. Nesbit, and of every classic fantasy writer you can think of who took some real-world culture or piece of history for their inspiration and spun a yarn that alleges to be fantastical but is inextricably tangled up in all their own real biases and egoism. (For the wry comment on vaguely drawn “exotic” fantasy cultures that smash thousands of years and many disparate cultures into a sketchy realm of magic carpets and sand, this Iranian American reader is grateful.) And Walton knows whereof she writes, since she's as much the highly awarded, famous-in-a-certain-circle fantasy novelist as her on-page surrogate, Sylvia.<br /><br />Yet Walton is also marvelous at writing reality like it’s fantasy - the unbelievably delicious “wish fulfillment narrative” of Teatro del Sale’s food and function, the world-building offered in real historical details of cities both Italian and Canadian, the escape of a portal fantasy in Sylvia’s move from abuse in Montreal to self-actualisation in Florence. Sometimes reality is fantastic. Sometimes fantasy is based on reality. Maybe, sometimes, through stories, through fantasies, we can leave Plato’s cave and emerge into a world where if a thing is perfect, “they have it there, and they always have,” a world where death comes as a chosen sacrifice, not an arbitrary horror. Where time stands still and perfection persists. Where to exist in a story is to exist forever, read and reread and immortal on the page.<br /><br />I received an advance review copy of Or What You Will from NetGalley and Tor Books in exchange for an honest review.",5.0,1,2020

"Author is a sophomore with a thesaurus who half-listened to her mythology unit in English class, DNF","It took me about 10 pages to decide this book is too poorly written to continue reading it.<br /><br />Strike 1: “And despite how much I loathed this town and the Midas veneer Eastridgers wore like minx (sic) on winter coats, I had never crossed the line of keeping something I’d touched. Until tonight with the ledger I just stole from my parents’ boss, Gideon Winthrop.”<br /><br />The Midas veneer they wore like mink on winter coats? What concept are you trying to communicate? Mink fur on coats isn’t a veneer, the mink is what provides the -actual- warmth. Or are you saying that they have a loathsome veneer of wealth (but no actual wealth) shown by the wearing of mink coats? Or are you saying they have actual wealth and they display it shallowly by wearing mink coats as a personal veneer?<br /><br />Strike 2: “Mounted on the silver-flecked marble of Gideon’s mansion, a silver statue of Dionysus rode a tiger sculpted from electrum and gold. The artist had etched the god’s cult of followers into the tiger’s legs, bearing a remarkable resemblance to Eastridge’s cult of wealth.”<br /><br />Wait, is the entire mansion made of marble? Is the statue mounted to the walls? The floors? A marble plinth? Moving on... The tiger legs have images of a Dionysian cult etched into them. Maybe this is a failure of my imagination, but I can’t even begin to picture that, much less extrapolate that image to understand the city’s cult of wealth.<br /><br />Strike 2.5 “The desk drawers held nothing interesting outside of employee files. I yanked the top one completely off of its track and felt around the hole it left. Just as I had finished up my search, my fingers brushed against buttery leather. After pulling off the tape, I latched onto the leather and plucked it from the cavern. Held up to the light, the journal boasted dust on its cover and nothing else.”<br /><br />The use of the word “cavern” to describe the slot a drawer fits into (or is it an additional crevice that holds a small book?) makes me wonder if the author is doing thesaurus searches to find alternate words for “drawer hole”.<br /><br />Strike 3: “I could have admitted it then, told Ma about Gideon’s misdeeds. I didn’t.<br />I was Sisyphus.<br />Crafty.<br />Deceitful.<br />A thief.<br />Instead of cheating death, I’d stolen from a Winthrop. The latter proved more dangerous than the former. Unlike Sisyphus, I had no intention of suffering eternal punishment for my sins.”<br /><br />This metaphor is more tortured than Sisyphus, who I’m pretty sure wasn’t a thief. Prometheus was the thief who received eternal punishment, I wonder if that’s who the author meant? I’m a little curious how the theft is dangerous if you have every intention of avoiding punishment, but not curious enough to read any more of this writing.<br /><br />My advice to the author: read some Hemingway. Clarity always trumps flowery, rambling, poorly constructed analogies and metaphors.",1.0,0,2020
Not even worth one star,"I borrowed this book from my library because I refuse to spend $10.99 for ANY Kindle book.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It's supposed to be funny, but I didn't find any funny moments in it.  It was way too long (could have been half the length).  Even if it was shorter, it would have been boring.  Bethany spend so much time thinking about why she had to have everything in her life be perfect. This went on for the whole book and got to be very tedious. I really liked Wes, but I don't know how he put up with Bethany.  I thought the book had a good premise, but never lived up to what it could have been.  The way the story wrapped up was just too neat and tidy and not very believable.  After reading the book, I am really glad that I didn't spend money on it.  As others have said, people who read many books a month cannot afford these prices.  Lower prices would mean many more sales instead of people borrowing from libraries.  I love reading on my Kindle, but not at this price.  I also want to recommend romance authors that have books that are half the price and much better - Layla Hagan, Kendall Ryan and Lauren Blakely. Another excellent rom-com author is Julia Kent.  Her Billionaire series is great!! All the books have true laugh out loud moments as well as heartfelt ones. Shopping for a CEO's Baby was just released.  It is a great book and is only $3.99 for over 300 pages.  I highly recommend it!!",1.0,0,2020
"Shakespeare, Hathaway, and Hamnet their son","I found this to be a moving and compelling interpretation of the relationship Shakespeare had with his wife, and a beautiful rendering of the short life, but ultimately immortal influence, that their son probably had on his work. I'm guessing the author has read ""The Second Best Bed"" by Carol Ann Duffy, which subtly and stirringly explains why Will's Will reads as it does. However, therein lies my one major quibble: WILL! Why, oh, why couldn't O'Farrell name the ""Latin tutor;"" ""young husband;"" ""father;"" ""son"" . . . Will? The coy avoidance of his name seems pointless, and even annoying. Surely we all know who he is from page one. Similarly, perhaps Agnes is really what someone, at some time, called Hathaway, but surely history has mostly recorded her as Anne. Why the fiddling with names? It mars the flow of narrative and makes the dialogue stilted and unnatural.  People address each other by their names, and think of each other by their names, not arbitrary and artificial descriptors. A good editor – despite what bar Hillary Mantel may or may not have set with Wolf Hall and all those pronouns – should have told O'Farrell to get off it and name names. ""What's in a name?"" Indeed. This rose would have smelled the sweeter had it been named Will! I was annoyed enough to have given the book only four stars, but in truth, I loved it anyway.",5.0,1,2020
Was Rosemary Kennedy's Birth During the Spanish Flu the Cause of Her Disabilities?,"""Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter,"" by Kate Clifford Larson is a poignant story about how the 20th Century's systems for dealing with individuals with intellectual and mental disabilities were abject failures.  Even all the family's money and fame could not save Rosemary from falling victim to the aftermath of a lobotomy, a radical treatment in its experimental stages that was supposed to secure her future, not ruin it.<br /><br />I purchased this book when it first came out in 2016, after seeing a positive review of it in a magazine.  Somehow, I never got around to reading the book until now, but that made the beginning of the book more understandable to me. You see, Rosemary was born during the height of the pandemic known as the Spanish Flu, over 100 years ago.  Because the doctor was so busy attending to an overload of patients, he was over two hours late to Rosemary's birth at home.  Following the doctor's orders that he must be present at birth, the attending nurse kept the baby in the birth canal even after Rosemary's head had crested. Today, that procedure would be known to likely deprive the child's brain of oxygen. By reading this book in 2020, I better understood that a pandemic could overwhelm the doctor's schedule.<br /><br />Larson uses primary sources like letters and diary entries obtained from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. By this method, she neither glorifies nor vilifies the Kennedys.  Rather, she uses their own words to relay key events. Larson also interviewed friends, relatives, teachers, and servants, so interpretation of events as shaped by recollections does come into play.<br /><br />What stayed with me was that Rosemary was  a beautiful young woman with severe developmental delays for which her very prominent family did not want her (or themselves) to be ridiculed.  Up to a certain age, this could be accomplished by restricting her circle of acquaintances.  She was sent to exclusive day schools or boarding schools. Her writing abilities never exceeded those of a 5th grader, even when she was in high school.  As she progressed to her later teens, she participated in social events, but her dance card was filled by her brother Jack and his friends, so that others would not notice her limited and immature conversational skills.<br /><br />She adored her family members, and particularly yearned for her father's approval.  The happiest years of her life were those lived in London while her father served as the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom in the days leading up to World War II.  She was even presented to the King and Queen.  She was a lovely girl living a dream life, although still sequestered so that others could not observe her disabilities.  Taught to be quiet in social situations, she was believed to be shy.<br /><br />When her father fell out of favor with President Roosevelt over Kennedy's belief that Germany would defeat England and that the US should stay out of it, Kennedy resigned as the ambassador, and the family headed back to the US.  By now, Rosemary was 22 and her absence from the public eye could no longer be hidden by the excuse of her being away at school. In addition to her intellectual disabilities, she began to display more indications of increasing mental illness that made her moody and combative. Her father had huge political aspirations for his sons, so he was desperate to seek whatever avant-garde treatments that could be found to make Rosemary more socially acceptable. Unfortunately, he selected a lobotomy.  And just like that, the happy girl with a winning smile lost her ability to speak and walk.  She spent the rest of her life in private care at institutions rarely visited by family. It is not clear if her siblings even knew just how bad off she was.<br /><br />Again, I'm glad I read this book during the pandemic of 2020.  It made me wonder how many yet unknown tragedies are being caused today by overloaded hospitals and overworked medical personnel.",5.0,1,2020
"Forgiven and Loved - Yes, but this books causes confusion","This book continues the confusion I have heard all my life from various Christian sources. I am glad I finally learned to read and listen to what the BIBLE says. I fear that too many who read this book equate ""not sinning"" with ""works."" What?! That is crazy. Not killing someone is not ""works."" Not eating unclean animals, for instance, is not ""works,"" nor is it legalism or being a Pharisee. It is obeying God. Being a Pharisee is obeying man-made (that is, rabbi-made) laws. The Pharisees were not following the Bible only but also the ""oral law"" which was later written down as the Talmud and which was NOT written by God but followed even more closely than the Bible. That is why they were getting on Jesus' case for his disciples not washing their hands before eating: nowhere in the Old Testament is there a command about washing your hands before eating, but the RABBIS had made such a law and the Pharisees followed, and this is why they scolded Jesus. The Pharisees' legalism was NOT about following God's laws. They were following what Jesus called the ""synagogue of satan"" in that they followed their OWN laws.<br /><br />""What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."" -- Romans 6:15<br /><br />""What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."" -- Romans 7:17<br /><br />YES, there is much grace -- but you cannot nail every commandment of God to the cross and say, ""Okay, now it's all grace and I can sin all I want."" Not sinning is a way we can show God -- show Christ Jesus -- that we LOVE Him. And God being incredibly and unbelievably merciful does everything a Father -- a real, loving Father -- can do to help us and guide us. He did not give us laws as in the 10 commandments in the King James Bible to punish or hurt us. He did not tell us not to eat unclean animals to hurt us. He tells us these things to HELP us and so we can get to know Him. And one of the biggest lessons of the Old Testament was how much He wants us to OBEY Him. Jesus said the same thing, that if we love Him we will obey Him.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I love to learn ways to obey God that I did not know about before. I used to eat lots of bacon -- and when I realized that nowhere in the Bible did God change His mind about that, I was pleased to learn another way to obey Him. (And no, Peter's dream was NOT about making all ""foods"" clean as the NIV lies. Read further in the chapter and Peter tells the meaning of the dream -- and it had NOTHING to do with eating unclean animals.)",2.0,0,2020
Slavery. Escape to Freedom. Beautiful Poetic Prose. Magical.,"Ta-Nehisi Coates is well known for his nonfiction works. I read and very much enjoyed Between the World and Me, which I reviewed on Amazon in 2016. He has also written his memoir, The Beautiful Struggle, and another nonfiction work, Eight Years in Power. Coates’ comic book endeavors are less well known. I recently found out that he has worked on a Black Panther comic book for Marvel Comics.<br /><br />The Water Dancer is a New York Times best seller and was number one in the Hardcover Fiction and the Print and E-book Fiction categories when it was first published in September 2019. Oprah Winfrey selected it for her Oprah’s Book Club on Apple TV. According to Wikipedia, Oprah has said that The Water Dancer is one of the best 5 books she has ever read.  I was excited to find out that Oprah Winfrey and Brad Pitt are now producing a film version of The Water Dancer.<br /><br />Originally, I listened to The Water Dancer on Audible. Sometimes a poor narrator can ruin a book, but this was definitely not the case here.  Joe Morton is an exceptional narrator. I was so captivated by the story and the skillful and powerful narration that I ended up buying both the Kindle version and the hardback.  The hardback is to keep and treasure, for this is a book that I would cherish and hand down to my children and grandchildren.<br /><br />The Water Dance is historical fiction with a strong mystical and magical thread. It is the story of the enslavement of a people and the struggle for freedom from the yoke of slavery. The main protagonist is Hiram Walker, who was born into slavery on the Lockless plantation in Virginia. When he was 9 years old, his mother was sold, and he was so devastated that he lost all memory of her. Although his mother was a slave, he knew he was the son of the plantation owner, Nathaniel Walker. When his father invites him to the main house to work as a servant instead of leaving him to toil in the fields, he is at first delighted. He pictures a bright future.  However, that future is not realistic and is certainly not the future Hiram envisioned. He is still a slave and has to serve the whites’ agenda. He is one of the Tasked, not one of the Quality, who are all white.<br /><br />Note that Ta-Nehisi  Coates uses the terms ‘Tasked’ and 'Quality' instead of  ‘Master’ and ‘Slave’.  What is revealing here is that the 'Slave' is dependent on his 'Master'. On the other hand, the 'Quality' are dependent on the 'Tasked' (slaves). Coates maintains that the 'Tasked' support the 'Quality', for the Tasked do the work and keep the plantation operating smoothly. The 'Quality' are dependent on the 'Tasked' to take care of them and are pretty much helpless without them.<br /><br />Hiram is called to entertain the Quality at parties, for he is exceptionally bright and is gifted with a photographic memory. His gifts make him a hit with the card playing whites. He is the boy wonder, but he is also a slave and is taught to know his place. As one of the Tasked, he has been told to watch over the all-White Maynard, his irresponsible, degenerate half-brother.  Maynard frequently commands Hiram to take him to town to drink and visit prostitutes.  On the drive home one dark night, the carriage overturns and throws Hiram and Maynard into the Goose River. Hiram is struggling in the water, when he hears Maynard call out for help.  Maynard had never had the discipline to learn to swim, although Hiram had tried hard to teach him.  The night of this carriage accident Maynard disappears under the water and is pulled away by the current. Hiram is unable to save him. As Hiram sinks into the deep water and fights for his life, he sees a blue light and images of what he thinks must be his mother dancing in the water with a jar upon her head. Miraculously, he soon finds himself onshore and safe. This is Hiram’s first experience with the power of conduction.<br /><br />Now what is conduction? It is a tapping of energy with a strong memory of place or person, an intention to transport oneself or others to another physical place.  We all have had times when we dream of being in another place. We can visualize it vividly. In our dreams and sometimes even when we are awake, our yearnings take us there in our imagination. Ta-Nehisi Coates takes this a step further to a surrealistic traveling to another physical location. It is a journey that takes very little time at all, but requires a tremendous outpouring of energy from the conductor. In The Water Dance, there is always a blue light that appears and the presence of water for conduction to occur. All of this is surreal, of course, but Ta-Nehisi Coates uses this power of conduction effectively for his story. When Hiram remembers his mother vividly, when he deepens his memory of time and place, his powers of conduction increase, and he uses this power to transport slaves to freedom.  Hiram partners at times with the master of conduction, Harriet Tubman. He works for the Underground Railroad and the freedom of his people.<br /><br />There are many 4 star reviews out there.  However, without a moment’s hesitation, I gave this book a 5 star rating.  I have read criticisms of Ta-Nehisi Coates’ so-called narrative gaps that lead to confusion for the reader. Have we forgotten that many of our contemporary well-respected and often prize-winning authors go back and forth in time to follow the protagonist’s memories of events? Yes, many other authors do this, and certainly Ta-Nehisi Coates uses the power of memory as a strong theme. There are also those reviewers who object to the surrealistic aspect of the book. Some even say the less magical parts deserve the most attention. These people are only concerned with the narrative (who did what etc.)  I believe they are missing what makes this novel so magnificent. Much of the writing is really poetry in prose form. Poetry takes us beyond the words to heights of emotion that touch our souls.  Ta-Nehisi Coates achieves this depth in his novel. The Water Dancer is incredibly powerful and evocative; it is heartbreaking and gorgeous.",5.0,1,2020

"Good foundation, interesting main character, angst does flow too much.","Ah the joys of a writer who uses lack of self-esteem and angst to add to the page count.  And here the main character can almost be guaranteed to dither, worry and self-doubt himself into long mental soliloquies on occasion just to give pages of nothing a chance to make this story longer.<br /><br />It reads fast, and overall the characters are interesting if somewhat lacking in depth.  Illia clearly adores the main character, but he doesn't notice because he's pining for Atty, the beautiful heiress who he never talks to (and who rarely gets much page time.)  He's got Zaxis as the foil who shouldn't hate the MC, but does because ""reasons"" and.....<br /><br />Honestly, the characters are better than average.  They have personalities and you can easily tell them apart.  But, they are all written as very angsty teenagers who suffer from a complete inability to say ""Hey stupid, let's date.""  Which had me nearly laughing at times because it was so obvious to the reader that X likes Y, but Z is chasing X and don't forget A, B and C who also have hormones driving them, but no willingness to speak up.  It's like the worst most G-Rated Disney teen drama.<br /><br />The rest is interesting though.  The plot had a lot of thought put into it, and the challenges and tribulations made sense, which makes this a story that I can happily give 4 stars to even while I shake my head at the angst.<br /><br />So good tale, but remember, its written like a teen girl romance with angst and miscommunication in every possible romantic combination.",4.0,1,2020

A crisis of faith and romance,"Although I don't lean toward stories about religion and faith crises, this book is so much more than that. It's a romance--more than one, actually. In the background is the main one between Elsa and Joaquin, but Joaquin is called to the priesthood, breaking Elsa's heart. In present day, Elsa is a minister in Seattle, very happy but with unresolved issues. When tragedy strikes a member of her community, she loses faith and can't move beyond the heartbreak. She moves back to her hometown of Pueblo, CO, where Joaquin, now priest of a church in an impoverished neighborhood, presents an opportunity for her to wrestle with her demons. Meanwhile, there is a rich subplot with Elsa's sister, Tamsin, and a sub-subplot (romance) concerning Tamsin's daughter. There's a romantic thread with Elsa and an ex-con, a community garden that brings together the disparate and very well-drawn characters in the neighborhood, and a gang leader who menaces them. And of course, in all of this author's books, there are the dogs and other animals who add a layer of joy.

"Gloom, Despair and Agony","I am reminded of a very old cartoon.  Two women are leaving a theatre where the window ad display is “A Long Day’s Journey into Night”.

But, if I wanted to be depressed, I could have stayed home and done the ironing.”<br /><br />That was the feeling I had through most of this story – this long, long story.<br /><br />On the other hand, I was engrossed by the tale and while I could put it down (as I said, it is a long, long story) I would never have stopped reading it.<br /><br />I won’t recap the plot except to say that Our Dear Couple is apart (as in married to other people) and don’t come together until the 90% mark of the book.

So, I will go on to BASH'S book by Sapphire Knight to get my next fix from the Kings of Carnage, but I will definitely be putting Hilary Storm's books that are on my TBR list right to the top! I just cannot go this long again without reading her fabulous stories.<br /><br />I will leave you with this one last thought...The Covers of This Series! Holy Freakin' Crap! The HOTTEST MODELS were used for the HOTTEST SERIES! I am not kidding, read CHAOS today and see what I'm talking about!! HOT, HOT, HOT!",5.0,1,2020
A quick read but worth the time,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br />What a dangerous and emotional story. The H and h were amazing. I loved their personalities. They were so raw, so realistic and quite spontaneous. Both were mature, honorable, loyal and thoughtful. Even though the h was running for her life to protect her baby brother, she had fortitude, inner strength; it was her fear that dictated her actions rather than common sense. But her fears were not unfounded. Her guardian was an evil wicked man who inflicted harm to her and her baby brother. She ran away and ended up in the employment of the H. He was the first man who saw her. Really saw her as she was. A frightened young lady with a baby. But the h was too afraid to let him get too close. Her guardian had everyone fooled that he was the life of the party and a wonderful person. But she experienced his dark side when others did not. She felt no one would believe her especially the H. The H did all he could to assist her and the baby. He felt compelled to protect her and stay near her. He could not explain what he was feeling but he knew it was strong and he knew she felt it as well. Then the crap hit the fan and the h felt she had to run again. The guardian was spreading lies about her mental capacity and was searching for her and the baby. Terrified she went to her lodgings to pack and get the baby. But the guardian was already there. They fought. The h did all she could to protect the baby. Just when she thought she had lost the fight; the H shows up and fights the guardian. He was furious at what he had seen. He had seen the guardian cruelly treating the h and fighting with her. What was going to happen? Would the H be able to overcome the guardian and have him arrested? And what about their relationship? What would happen? Would he find her too much trouble and a burden and let her go? Or would they take some time to explore what they felt between them? This is such an emotional story and it is definitely a page turner. This is a quick read and worth the time.

"Heavy on action, light on character and plot","I wanted to like this story.  I like books about the apocalypse, especially when the authors think through how the survivors interact.  I also have a good tech background and enjoy it when tech issues are well-considered.  The character development is non-existent, and the radiation-eating nano-bot swarms are far-fetched, even given the futuristic setting.

Unique,"Jack’s gets five stars for her unique world building in which angels descended upon the earth and proceeded to destroy humans, and the they remade the world. I really like the main character Julia in the beginning  of the book, but the her strength of character is shoved under as she interact with Micheal, the dark anti hero.<br /><br />The problem I have is the execution of the plot.  I still don’t know why the angels decided to kill humans after they arrived on Earth. As a reader I found out the reasons they fell to earth, but not why they went all mass murderous on mortals. The author has some continuity and pacing issues that should have been addressed prior to publishing.  I don’t know what kind of editor she employed but in the developmental stage Jack’s could have used some guidance, as some plot issues just don’t add up. I do expect plot points to make sense. Especially if the characters actions end up impacting the story. In this story the Before is what the character’s know as modern life.  Most all characters except the Angels don’t remember the Before. If a human does remember his free is captured by Lucifer and they become mindless killing machines the Marked.  Here is where I have a problem with the plot. First what sparks the survivors memories not the word coffee a word of the Before, used in the new reconstructed world. But, the word money sparks memories and a crowd of the Marked happens, and all are eliminated.  How is coffee different than money? What is the demarcation line between the words making some unusable. Here the plot gets very convoluted, as to remember means the characters free will is snatched. Well major problem is that Micheal the hero/architect of the newly created world pretty much has taken everyone’s free will already. As people eat, sleep and do what he commands. When he commands. So how does Lucifer rob them of something they truly no longer posses? Free will is non existent in the world created by Jacks even if the author doesn’t realize she eliminated it in her construct. Free will means death either way. If a person betrays Micheal by expressing free will, example of making Lucifer a spear. The character is tricked into remembering on Michael’s orders. Therefore resulting in death. To betray Micheal means death. Where does free will truly reign, back in the Before. Even the heroine Julia who amongst everyone in the story does have true free will, bows to Micheal’s creation.<br /><br />The book left more questions unanswered than it actually explained which is fine in a paranormal fantasy series, I just hope Jack’s and her editor lean to tighten up the plot of the next story. This could have been a solid four star read for me. But I need the reason how a fantasy paranormal world exists.<br /><br />I read via Kindle Unlimited.",3.0,0,2020
Poorly written and discursive,"I'm sorry to say that I disagree with other reviewers that say this book is well-written.  It seemed to me to be very poorly written with many confusing, out-of-order repetitions of elements of the timeline.  I also did not appreciate a few barely-comprehensible attempts at literary description (examples: ""With political influence came the need for power. Corruption, which is fueled by power, didn’t linger."" -- what? ""The Americans were referred to as “Outlaws”, although they made no secret of who they were, or their purpose."" -- so transparency about one's objectives somehow means one is not an outlaw? I don't get the connection). There also was too much editorializing for my taste: ""The sovereignty of the ‘several’ states, as protected under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, had been lost to the emerging power of a dominate federal government not intended by the founders."" Wow. Leaving aside the grammatical error (or is it merely a spelling problem?), a large and complex issue that is outside the scope of this book is here summarily settled by the author in one casual sentence.<br /><br />On the plus side, I appreciate the author's commitment to thorough research and his care to describe documentary sources of information. Unfortunately, I simply lost the thread of the narrative in the discursive, ultra-personalized writing and gave up 20% of the way through the book.",1.0,0,2020

Winspear Doesn't Disappoint!,The memoir was excellently written -- the details and descriptions and privations of her childhood years were exceptional -- I felt like I was there.  It was obvious some of her childhood has made it into some of her books - especially the hops picking.  I remember in one of the Maisie Dobbs' books that Eddie and his family picked hops.  Ms. Winspear is a captivating writer.  I'm so glad that a friend of mine recommended the Maisie Dobbs' books to me several years ago.  I have read all and am hoping there will be another soon.  I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it as well as all of her books.,5.0,1,2020
Unclear target audience,"The companion book (released simultaneously) is certainly targeting serious practitioners and scholars;  this one is intended for general audience, but may not be suitable as an introductory book for mindfulness.  This is mostly due to the following concerns -  Analayo is a scholar first and foremost (I have benefited from all his prior works), the writing style is still too dense for a beginner;  the citations are mostly to his own works  and not the original source (constantly seeing the authors name is every page detracts from the reading experience); some of the similies fundamental to the understanding of Buddhist approach have been given a very shallow treatment or assumes some prior knowledge of them.  (for example, he refers to 16 types of breathing meditations and then no direct explanation of those in the same context he mentions them, etc.)<br /><br />Despite those concerns, Analayo attempts to provide a more practical approach - by providing a summary and some practice suggestions (usually a few paragraphs).  Even here, the degree to which a beginner can benefit is very limited. For example, one practice suggestion is ""By not neglecting the potential of wisdom, we can conjoin this mode of bare and open awareness with the potential of insight into impermanence"" - a scholar may be able to understand this, but a beginner will see a collection of keywords strung together.<br /><br /> It is laudable that such a well-established scholar has attempted to bring his thoughts to a general audience, but there are much better books for an introduction to mindfulness that does not dilute or over-securalize the Buddhist concepts (Joseph Goldstein's Mindfulness - A Practical Guide to Awakening  is my top choice for a thorough, practical introduction).  At best, this work can serve as a quick refresher for those who are well on their way in their meditation practice and re-orient/confirm their experience.",3.0,0,2020
An incredible story!,"This is an incredible story told by Ramona Flightner as no one else can tell it. Kevin is a remarkable man as is all of his O’Rourke family members. I loved watching him fall in love with Aileen during the two months they were on the steamboat. He knew she was on her way as a mail order bride in his home town of Fort Benton, Montana and despaired at the thought of losing her. However, Aileen was traveling with her conniving aunt who belittled and disparaged her at every chance. We can see a lot of angst and discord, many side stories, happy and sad reunions, deceitful evil men and women, each character very well fleshed out, ones you can well imagine as in your own acquaintance. You can easily envision the scenes described, being on a steamboat, in a small western town, saloon fights, large family dinners....I found myself on a wide spectrum of emotions. But I am very satisfied with the final outcome of Kevin and Aileen’s story. Since the O’Rourke family has so many members, I can imagine we have many more stories to look forward to in this series.",5.0,1,2020
Time Travel with a Twist,"Good action plot not going too far back. This is one of those going back to change things kind of time travel and you can guess from the title what was changed. Of course changing 9/11 was big but was it as big as maybe killing baby Hitler? Who knows! Towards the end, the plot seemingly does not hang together quite right until the very last sentence.

A very suspenseful read that keeps you guessing.,"“The less you know, the safer you are”<br />Brother’s Keeper 1: Declan is the newest release from Stephanie St. Klaire. It’s a brand-new series from St. Klaire and is a crossover series. We meet the O’Reilly brothers (as well as some cousins) which sets up this new series.  This is Declan’s story. We met him near the end of Hidden (McKenzie Ridge series, book 2). Do not worry, it is written so that if you haven’t read the McKenzie Ridge series you won’t be lost (though that series is fantastic and you should read it). Declan, basically is two stories in one! Part 1 of this story has Declan and Lydia on the run (which takes place prior to the story Hidden) and the second part of this book picks up 2 years after part 1 which is current day (and takes place after Fearless book 4 of McKenzie Ridge series). This is a big meaty book with over 100k words and 43 chapters. There is a lot of action and edge of your seat suspense. Stephanie St. Klaire consistently delivers well written books with developed storyline and characters. A very suspenseful read that keeps you guessing. Twist and turns with an impressive ending you won’t see coming.<br />Note:  I originally read and reviewed when this was published as one book (a huge book). It has since been release into two books, same read, just split into part 1 and part 2.",5.0,1,2020
Cliffhanger ending,I know that series are the “thing” these days.  But I should be informed that the book is part of an ongoing tale before I get to the end of book one.  And there should be some significant resolution between books — as if each is something of a stand alone novel.  There was no resolution in this book.  Combined with the mediocre storytelling and the questionable editing (there were at least three instances where the author used “you’ll” when he clearly meant “you’d”) I can’t give this more than two stars.,2.0,0,2020
Very comprehensive overview of watercolor landscape basics,"This is one of the better comprehensive overviews of basic watercolor techniques, especially for landscape painting. I didn’t appreciate this at first, but now that I've read many other watercolor books this one really does cover a ton of material in one place and is a great starting point for beginners. I will say, personally I don’t connect with the Author’s painting style in many of the examples, so I prefer to look elsewhere for art inspiration, but looking beyond that there is some great info here.<br /><br />I’d recommend the hard cover version if available or else the newer “The Complete Watercolorist's Essential Notebook” which combines this title with ""The original Watercolorist's Essential Notebook"" ; the Kindle version is plain old, standard kindle format, which I don’t love for art and how-to books and is a bit buggy on top of it (MacOS Desktop Kindle App).",4.0,1,2020
"Wanted to give five stars just for the unique narration, but I have a few nitpicks.","First of all, this author has a very, very strong voice. A strong/distinctive/unique narration is a rare treasure. I absolutely loved it. I'm a fantasy fan, so this really struck me as something different.<br /><br />Mia, the main character, is trauma central. But it fits in the story, and her trauma is intertwined almost masterfully into the plot. It drives the plot, along with a mysterious power she possesses but downplays, until she remembers something (I'm trying not to give spoilers here).<br /><br />The revelations/flashbacks aren't just used as a plot device in Nevernight. They're well-placed, and while they might be able to be classified as ""exposition"" by really picky folk, I feel that they were always relevant to the part of the story from which we're taking a break. They aren't those precious reveals so many authors feel they need.<br /><br />This author had a great editor (well, likely many, as is common with traditional publishing), obviously. They preserved what was unique about his writing, and did not try to box him in to something more conventional. The flashbacks serve a purpose. They move the story forward, and they don't exist simply as exposition, in my opinion. Not the bad kind.<br /><br />The worldbuilding was also well done! I loved Godsgrave, and the placement within the (I'm assuming) dead god's bones. The power distribution is so similar to so many structures in the real world that I could visualize it without the author telling me exactly what I was ""looking at"". I love the connection between the different classes and where they live in the mammoth, skeletal remains of a dead being.<br /><br />The light/dark trope is an oldie but a goodie, and here, the author utilizes it in a way that's unique. Look, not all tropes are bad. Some become tropes because they resonate with humanity. And this one certainly does. In a newish way.<br /><br />Character motivation and development is decently executed here.<br /><br />The not-cat, I fell in love with. This author has a great ear for dialogue, and for writing distinct characters.<br /><br />I leave a lot of reviews here. I tend to be harsher to those who go the traditional route, and I love exploring independent authors because there are so many who deserve recognition and don't get it. This is one of the few traditionally punished books I've reviewed for a while. Overall, it was good.<br /><br />What are my complains?<br /><br />Okay, let me do a compliment sandwich here. I thought a woman wrote this at first, because it's from a female POV. The main character is a woman. And she's written like a real woman...at first. Slight spoiler alert upcoming.<br /><br />So, there's a thing in books, that many authors suffer from. And I like to call it ""magic d**k syndrome."" This is where a female character suffers from trauma, pain, anxiety, or anything, really, and then a man comes along, intimacy happens, and boom! That man's nether regions are magical enough to solve the female character's problems. That happens in this book. The main character sleeps with her ""love"" interest, then the nightmares that have been plaguing her for most of her life, go away! And it personally annoys me to see this. Especially after respecting the author for presenting a woman as a human being instead of a pair of walking breasts<br /><br />BIGGER SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Also, of course, the main character isn't conventionally attractive. At first. Then, the ""weaver' fixes her (along with everyone else, to be fair) so that she's slightly more attractive. And, of course, that involves making her breasts bigger. Again, this is a thing that personally annoyed ME, and I do understand that it was done for a reason that does work within the book. That's not why I'm not giving it five stars.<br /><br />The reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I don't really want to read the next one. I loved this book. I thought it worked great as a standalone. The ending seemed rushed with some hand-of-God-type events.<br /><br />I also, personally, feel as though the author may not have known, when he wrote this, what exactly Mia was. And I worry that the answer to that will be underwhelming for that reason. There's zero resolution to that here. And while I don't expect a series to totally resolve a major part of the MC's origin story, (especially when she's so desperate to find out why she's darkin and what that means) I wish there would have been a bit more—even just a morsel—of resolution there. If I had to guess, there isn't any in the second book, either, which then puts a lot of pressure on the author to drive that home in the final book in a very impactful way. If anyone could pull that off, it would be this author. But I'm not sure I'm willing to wait that long for an answer.<br /><br />So, while I love so much about this book, I feel satisfied with the one. I will read any other books or series from him, but I will not finish this one. But I do highly recommend it. It's a unique fantasy novel, and the writer is clearly very talented. Beautiful imagery and sensory details. Definitely read this book if you like fantasy!",4.0,1,2020
"A lonely characters, lonely life","We get Jake, who is unmarried, a bit of a loner and who stumbles through a gateway into a ""new"" universe.<br /><br />It could have been a ton of fun, but for the first 60+% of the book you have Jake and the persona-less AI Brick.  That's it.  Jake keeps trying to fix things with the support of Brick, but it just seems empty in a way.<br /><br />Its not a bad book, the plot does try to twist in unique ways, and there is a behind the scenes plot that adds some drama at times.  However, there just doesn't seem to be much character.  There's not much dynamic dialogue and Jake can't carry the story by himself.<br /><br />It changes a bit in part 3, but then introduces the buildup to book 2 in a rather ham-fisted way that in my opinion diminished the impact of the climax.<br /><br />Its a 3 star book.  Well written, good idea, but nothing that makes me want to recommend it or praise it.  I think most who like the genre and can get by with minimal graphs and charts will find this a pleasant if rather pedestrian read.",3.0,0,2020
Another enjoyable read from MJ Rose and Steve Berry,"It is always a pleasure when a book is an enjoyable read and a learning experience.  The House of Long Ago is such a novel.  This is billed as a Cotton Mather, Cassiopeia Vitt  collaboration, but Cotton is merely mentioned and truthfully, not terribly missed because Cassiopeia can certainly hold her own. The story is quick and the adventure satisfying, but more importantly,  I learned so much about the machinations within the art world involving the Nazi confiscation and destruction of so many precious works of art.

Not What I Expected,"I love this series and was sooo looking forward to this release. D.A. is always a one click for me and Billy and Ransom's story is one of those love stories that you go back to read over and over again because you feel the love come off the pages. The start of this book was definitely on the right track with the previous books with the drama and the suspense. I felt it during Ransom's recouping and art exhibit. I felt it even after Billy and Ransom broke up, saying to myself that this too will not last long b/c their love is too intense and they're passionate people. But boy was I wrong and the book became lackluster for me.<br /><br />I didn't feel the passion or connection between the first 3 books and this finale. Ransom wanting to be there for the babies was valid and I get it. Billy not ready to be a wife and parent so young I get that too. But I didn't get Billy's relationship w/ Nick nor Ransom's relationship w/ his wife.

Enjoy the Fellowship!,"In 16 Bible Studies for Your Small Group, Ryan Lokkesmoe explored topics and study lessons from your small group to help readers to open up and explore key components. He explored the topics of fellowshipping with God, fellowshipping with others, loving one another, put each other first, building each other up, dodging divisions, givers of courage, fellow servants and co-heirs, and much more. Throughout the book, he explained the power of fellowship and the important of gathering together with like minded believers. His goal was to guide readers into opening up with each other and connecting and understanding lessons from the Bible and how we can be transformed into the image of Christ. This book revealed how we are called to be the Church and how we live our lives out like we are supposed to. Each chapter included questions, key points, prayer, scripture verses, and a study story.<br /><br />I would recommend this amazing book to anyone who is ready for a new group Bible study. I immensely enjoyed how he explored the topics of fellowshipping with one another and what it means to truly love others like Christ loved the Church. I liked how you can choose certain ones and move around easily between the topics and you don’t necessarily have to study them in order. The book also included a short story at the beginning of each chapter but most of the chapter encouraged readers to open up about what the scriptures was declaring and leading us to do. This book has the potential to assist readers into opening up more in front of other believers and will help them to learn what others think and to hear more about their fellow neighbors’ personal stories. I liked how he included many questions throughout the lessons to help readers to dive into deeper into the Bible.",5.0,1,2020
Tons of potential...but took things too far.,"""I hope I find a good relationship now. Men can be so controlling at times.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for this one...so many sterling reviews from those I trust. And though it certainly wasn't bad, it was nowhere close to a five-star story for me...for two main reasons.<br /><br />1. It was over the top. I was all in regarding the first two twists. In fact, I thought it was all quite clever and struggled to put my Kindle down. The third and fourth twists, however...not so much. They actually gave the story a cartoon-ish quality I did not find appealing.<br /><br />2. The way in which the story was written. I'm honestly not sure what the goal of this writing style was, as it had the characters telling the actual story to each other instead of the reader. It was such an odd technique, making me feel very separate from the story in which I should have been immersed.<br /><br />Beyond that, I really struggled with the changing narration within each chapter. Each section was labeled with a character's name, indicating the chosen narrator...but from one paragraph to the next, it would randomly change. It was so confusing. My assumption is, that will be cleaned up in final edits...but man, did it make for some awkward reading. I remember one section, the female lead, Emma, was narrating. All the sudden, it read, ""I climax inside you, but this time I do not feel your muscles tightly clamped around me, encouraging me like they used to.""<br /><br />I was, obviously, scratching my head about that one.<br /><br />I won't get into the wonky police procedural, but rest assured, you will need to suspend belief.<br /><br />Regardless, this was a fun, easy, if somewhat problematic, story.

DNF,"I made it to about 55%. It was so boring and unrealistic. Every chapter seems to start with ""It's been a week since X happened..."" When the story starts, the male lead is 24, and he has to have a baby by the time he is 25. A pregnancy takes 10 months from conception, not 9, and there's no guarantee a woman will get pregnant right away. So by my count it is now too late for a pregnancy to fix things for the male lead, and the female lead has let her dad sit in jail for over a month instead of letting her rich friends pay the bail, even though she knows he's innocent and would presumably be able to pay the friends back himself. Plus the money is returned to you if you show up for court. And plenty of lawyers would take on a wealthy client with frozen assets under the agreement he would pay after trial. Some editing things are jarring too, like when she goes to his swanky office for a meeting at 9am, and he's pouring himself a drink or scotch, then she gets upset after a 2 minute conversation and when she runs out of his office it's suddenly night? The whole thing is just silly.<br /><br />Beyond the plot issues, the characters all act like they are 15 years old, never talk to each other beyond movie quotes apparently, and are both really undefined as people.

The premise, though, is so far-fetched that I, as a convert to Catholicism, find it a challenge to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />So, without revealing any spoilers, and without burdening readers with my political bias, I simply will tell you that, if a thriller involving the highest echelons of the Roman Catholic Church does not dissuade you from reading “The Order,” you are in for a great suspense.<br /><br />LANGUAGE This novel has no cursing that I found offensive. Certainly, there are no “f-words.”",4.0,1,2020

Interesting and Well-Researched,"After enjoying “The Fallen Girls” (Detective Clara Jeffries Book 1) I couldn’t wait for Book 2 to be released, and here it is! “Her Final Prayer” begins where “The Fallen Girls” ends. Clara Jeffries is now Chief of Police of her hometown in Alber, Utah. She doesn’t “feel” at home because the town still regards her as an apostate, an outsider. But Jeffries has her own reasons for coming “home” and part of that is to find resolution with her fundamentalist family, while the other part is the unresolved feelings she has for Max. Religion, tradition, and small town dynamics means everyone is watching all the time. Still, no one is willing to talk with Clara to help solve the brutal murder of Jacob’s two wives and two of their young children, while leaving Jacob fighting for his life. It isn’t necessary to read the first book in the series to enjoy this one, but I think you’d find it helpful to start in order. Casey does a wonderful job with character development and has a way of making the reader feel like they are part of the story. An interesting plot involving fundamentalist religion, with well-researched crime scene and police investigative tactics, and a few twists and turns along the way makes for another great Casey read. Start with Book 1, move on to Book 2, and then patiently wait with the rest of us for Book 3! You won’t be disappointed.",5.0,1,2020
Bad Story Badly Told,"“Into the Stars” is a bad story badly told.<br /><br />It’s a pc-riddled, woke, Silicon Valley product placement story in the late 21st century where ‘Earthlings’ after gaining FTL speed stumble upon an apex predatory alien empire through naïveté and hubris.<br /><br />The writing is horrendous - stilted, stiff, repetitive, and without any narrative flow; basically a bonafide train wreck making one wonder if English is the authors’ second language.

Disappointing,"When I was in school studying for my doctorate in physics GR was never taught, so in retirement I decided to try to understand it and in particular what it has to say about the behavior of photons. This book was a big disappointment. He spends no time on the details of geodesics and nowhere addresses the measurement of the absolute  velocity of light in the context of general relativity, which would have been helpful, and far too much (in my opinion) on gravitational waves, cosmology and related shiny topics.<br />More importantly, when you discover a serious flaw in a textbook it has the effect of raising doubts about its reliability in other areas. In 10.8 and 10.9 the author ties himself in knots arguing that the energy of a photon is a constant of the motion and at the same time that it is not. It is. This is part of a tortuous explanation of the gravitational redshift. He does not seem to grasp that a photon wave packet when stretched in time changes its frequency but not its total energy, and that the mechanism of gravitational time dilation does precisely that. If the one exists so does the other. Such pulse stretching and pulse compression is commonplace in optical and radar laboratories. Part of his error is in trying to introduce a quantum view where it won't fit.<br />He also attaches problems for the student ad nauseam, without so much as a hint to the answers (which are not included). Why not?<br />There are many excellent works on GR available free on the internet. I recommend in particular those from the Physics Labs at the University of Rome (INFN Roma).

This left me so emotionally loved and needing a hug,"These Arrowood brothers have been through so much. Much like all of Corinne's heroes And heroines, they have lived, been through life, and are still finding their ""home"". I knew from the time Declan made his first appearance I would love him. The weight that sat on his shoulders in that first introduction, endeared me to him.<br /><br />Getting to know Declan's love for Sydney was amazing. I felt so proud of Sydney, for how strong she was in trying to protect her heart. But a love like theirs is embedded in their souls. Learning to trust in each other again, trying to keep loyalty to the ones you love, including ones just coming into their lives. Getting to know the bond between these brothers is such a special experience, I think it's one of the things this author has perfected. The bond in her series makes you wish you could live in these stories and never have to go back to reality. How I loved having Milo's taunting charm and our second ""guest"" appearance! Watching Declan finally put his life for Sydney first, being the man she's waited for all these years was worth it ALL!<br /><br />I'm so excited to get to know Sean and Devney.

Amazingly Prescient for Pandemic Reading,"I bought this book 5 years ago and just now got around to reading it. I'm in the second week of ""shelter in place"" in San Francisco, California, during the CoVid 19 pandemic. I've only read a handful of chapters so far and I'm stunned with how the author captured the slow boil panic that happens in the community during a pandemic.<br /><br />He was particularly prescient when writing that the books virus came from wet markets in China and manifest itself with flu-like symptoms that were particularly deadly. When he mentioned ""social distance"" it was like a slap in the face.<br /><br />Yesterday, the line going into the local Trader Joe's went around the block because people had to queue up, using social distance, and were only allowed in a few people at a time only after a few people left. Store employees wearing disposable gloves were spraying everyone's hands with hand sanitizer before letting them in the store.<br /><br />I know I'm going to be reading this book, and the series, as a peek into the possible future. It feels very real to me at this time. I know it has zombies in it somewhere, I haven't found the zombies yet, but I'm prepared… For the zombies in the book anyway.<br /><br />One might ask why am I reading this book at this time. It's like when I watched the ""Exorcist"" before going in for a job interview. My reality might have been scary had I not been prepared by scaring myself worse than a job interview. The series I know will be scarier than what I'm prepared to live through, should I survive this pandemic. Stay safe everyone.",5.0,1,2020

Clean sweet romance,"I felt so bad for Philip as he truly cared for Jane and she spurned him even as she was forced to marry him. He is such a good person if a little lost in his world. Jane is also a good person but blinded by childhood fancies. And blinded by her mother's emotional abuse. I was shocked when her mother still voiced her negative opinions in front of Philip since he far outranked her and I was proud of Philip for standing up to her on Jane's behalf. I was left wondering how many of her sisters were married in the same forced manner as Jane. I hope that Jane and Philip will send for her little brother to keep him out of the clutches of her horrible parents.<br /><br />This is a clean and sweet romance. Sweet even though their relationship goes through some turmoil before it felt sweet. I enjoyed the read.<br /><br />No sex, language or violence.",4.0,1,2020
A must-different change in pace...,"Unlike Ms. Sanders' previous two novels in this series, this is far creepier and darker than her usual, so I would warn you NOT to read it during the darkest hour of night lest you find yourself still away until the morn because of fear. This book gave me the willies even though I knew it would end favorably. I do appreciate the writer's ability for realism in this universe's perimeters (which means that people DO die unfortunately, while others survive with scars to show for it).<br /><br />We meet Awarl (doesn't that sound like a sexy, feline growl? *shudder*) in the human's world in his fae glamor of a very sexy dude who's there just to get his rocks off. (According to Ms. Sanders' universe's rules regarding werewolves, they indulge in their sexual frenzy during the three days of a full moon to have sexual relationships in other places in order to find one's mate if that's in their futures. Sounds a lot like the Amish Rumspringa where Amish youth may take a ""time out"", depending on the order (of course) to explore the real world and decide whether or not they have what it takes to be Amish and join the Church Body, but the werewolves' version with without the religious attachments.) It's just the way things are in this universe. But in Awarl's case, he accidentally bonds with Ana, a wayward witch working at a bar with an otherworldly friend by the name of Jinx (who's a witch unto himself, too). In the attempt to rid himself of such an attachment, he realizes that this female was meant to be his mate on a cosmic level.<br /><br />Unlike ""the day in the life of"" style of story that Ms. Sanders writes, this is a true fantasy whodunit mystery that happens on the way to find a wizard to break this fated mate bond. THAT'S where the darkness comes in.<br /><br />Female werewolves are disappearing once again, and it appears that no is safe no matter what is done. Could the guilty party be one of the alphas? Or more? Not a very happy prospect. So Awarl and a few of the betas of his tribe leave to find out who's responsible and to do something about it. However, everyone isn't what they seem to be nor their environment either.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying as well as her two previous books. I hope I don't have to wait this long for another installment, you hear me??? I love this series as it is definitely writing outside the box!",5.0,1,2020
Hot Lanta,"Esme is about to turn forty. She makes a list of ten things she's never done, things she wants to accomplish by her birthday. In reverse order, the list shows #1, down at the very bottom, is Fall in Love. #9 is a surprise: Have Sex.<br /><br />When Esme, a financial analyst for a builder, is tasked to facilitate a somewhat-hostile merger with another company, she is forced to work with Trey, an executive from the opposing side. She and Trey have already met, and it didn't go well. In order to work out the differences between their companies, Trey, who has seen the lesser items on her list, but not the biggies, offers to help her get them done in exchange for Esme being more flexible in negotiations. Thus they begin spending time together, loosening up, moving from adversaries to friends to lovers.<br /><br />The premise is unlikely, but believable. Esme is no blushing baby. Her virginity is a choice made by a smart, assertive woman. She and Trey have (graphic) sexual encounters leading up to actual intercourse, and he doesn't know about #9 on the list until far into the novel. At this age, it could be seen as a red flag; his interest isn't guaranteed, and Esme is unsure she'll get what she wants.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story. It's often LOL funny; one standout was in the middle of a very graphic situation. The heat level is a 9 out of 10. Author DL White puts a lot of effort into descriptions of food, furnishings, and settings (the Ferris wheel overlooking the city, for ex., or a rooftop restaurant.) As an occasional visitor to Atlanta, I enjoyed seeing how city life might look for a couple of affluent thirty-somethings living in a quite sophisticated world. Recommended.",4.0,1,2020
Perfection from the cover to the last page,"I suppose I could be feeling generous with my pandemic reads, so grateful for new juice that I'm happy to dole out five-star reviews...but it could also be that I woke up super early this morning and was sitting here looking stupid and this book had just slid into my Kindle and I decided to start reading.<br />And couldn't stop. It's really, really good.<br />I had a discussion with the author surrounding my dislike for faux relationship books. I said, when I read Temporary Wife Temptation, that I decided that I won't read them except under specific circumstances. Given the culture and traditions that are the complete opposite of western culture and tradition, the need and requirement to find someone or we will find someone for you is strong. I got it, I felt it, I was stressed along with the characters. If the author provides a good, logical reason to fake up a relationship, that's good drama. You scared to tell your grandma that you're still single?  Need you to man up.<br />Queen of Barrakesch is the third in the royal brides series.

The Story of a Powerful Family and a Quest for Revenge,"From the first chapter, this book promises to be a blockbuster because it has everything that fans of Nora Roberts crave.  The family in the book is the powerful and wealthy Sullivan clan, a family of stars on the stage and screen.  Caitlyn Sullivan was born into this sophisticated enclave and seemed destined for stardom herself until she was kidnapped at the age of ten.  Determined not to let that event set the path for the rest of her life, Cate moves to Ireland with her father to recuperate from the trauma and then comes back to the family home in Big Sur.  From there, she goes to New York and back to Big Sur.  The family estate seems to call to her as no other place does.  There is romance aplenty in the novel and lots of action as Cate continues to be hounded by her mother and her kidnappers.  I enjoyed the story as well as Roberts’ signature staccato style, with short choppy sentences that describe the action as well as the setting.  If you are a fan of her “in Death” series (writing as J.D. Robb), you will understand exactly what I mean.  The sentence structure and the author’s talent of creating a scene that you feel that you can step into are what draws me to her novels, again and again.  Fans of Nora Roberts will love the non-stop action in this book and will want more of the romantic scenes.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I personally don’t like the expletives that are used so consistently in the book, but I do understand that they may be used for effect.  That being said, this was an excellent read that had me spellbound and wanting to find out the final destiny of Cate.<br />Disclaimer<br />Disclosure of Material Connection:  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher, St. Martin’s Press.

Interesting Read,"The book is okay, but I probably won't be reading any future ones. Regardless, here's my opinion of the story:<br /><br />WRITING STYLE: The author writes well. I didn't get lost in the text and it is well edited. Not a riveting writer. I never felt immersed, almost like I do when I hear about something third hand.<br /><br />PLOT: This is probably were the author lost me. I just didn't find the plot all that interesting. In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a woman who is offered to join a crew of individuals who fall more on the illegal side of their business. They travel to a world to unearth ancient, alien technology to sell and become rich. Things go wrong. They are discovered. They meet another alien, get trapped by a alien device and must escape, and then flee with the alien so that they aren't caught by the authorities. It simply wasn't that interesting to me.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: The characters were good. They had unique personalities, slightly bigger than life. The best part of the characters was the alien. The author did a fantastic job of making the alien seem alien. Too many sci-fi authors make their aliens too human. The alien in this book thinks completely differently, and that is probably what I liked the best about this book.<br /><br />KID SAFE: I'd rate this about a PG-13. There is profanity scattered throughout, and implied, casual sex between characters. The sexual encounters are never described, though there is a part when a male and female are wrestling where I think it becomes too descriptive of how their emotions turn. I would certainly run this book through a profanity filter.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd recommend this book. I just couldn't get into it. I read it to the end--I'm stubborn--but I never felt riveted--mostly by the plot which was stale and unimaginative.",3.0,0,2020

While some of her struggles (i.e., alcoholism) appear to be real, the way she plays the victim with all her ""struggles"" in life is utterly ridiculous.  She seems to blame everyone else for her lot in life.  She appears to have very little actual self-awareness.  She seems to do a lot of good deeds for others, especially touring military bases around the world, and for which I applaud her greatly.

No good deed goes unpunished.  ~ Oscar Wilde,"Elizabeth Bennet’s good deed?  Overhearing a man and a girl in a heated argument and interfering to save the young lady.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet’s punishment?  She must marry the girl’s brother to forestall scandal involving both families.<br /><br />In the long run wives are to be paid in a peculiar coin — consideration for their feelings.  As it usually turns out this is an enormous, unthinkable inflation few men will remit, or if they will, only with a sense of being overcharged. ~ Elizabeth Hardwick<br /><br />Elizabeth’s husband, one Fitzwilliam Darcy, is so convinced that Elizabeth is the only one to gain from their marriage that he shows no consideration for her feelings at all.  Oh, he arranges for his Aunt to take her shopping for a wardrobe that won’t disgrace the family.  He allows her to redecorate the mistress’ quarters which haven’t been used since Lady Anne Darcy’s death.  He arranges a suitable horse for her and instructs his grooms to give her riding lessons.  It never once occurs to him to attend to her riding lessons himself, much less to ride with her.  After all, a wardrobe is all a wife wants, isn’t it?<br /><br />Quote from the book:  She should be pleased with her situation, and she is. He brushed aside such minor irritations as Miss Simms’s insult; Elizabeth had too much wit to mind what such a ridiculous lady said. She gained a great deal by our marriage, and she is the envy of many, to be my wife and mistress of Pemberley. I am glad she can appreciate it.<br /><br />Even worse attitude comes from her new sister-in-law who is not a sweet, shy little soul.  Imagine, Elizabeth removed one day from an active home with parents and four sisters with varying degrees of sense, nurture, and boisterousness and placed in a house (not at all a home) with a cold, detached husband and an openly hostile new sister.  Her extended family ranges from Lady Catherine and Anne de Bourgh who feel cheated by her scheming ways to the Fitzwilliams who worry only for their own social position.  In a switch from the usual JAFF variation, Colonel Fitzwilliam is less sympathetic to Elizabeth than his older brother Sterling, the Viscount.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  If she dared, she would tell them that she had no wish to be part of their family, and ask that they get on with deciding how they would trick society into believing she and Darcy had married for love, and that his relations were delighted with the match.<br /><br />If you are afraid of loneliness, don't marry. ~ Anton Chekhov<br /><br />After a brief stay in London, the Darcys journey to Pemberley where Elizabeth tries her best to learn her duties as Mistress of such a large estate.  The first person to notice the new Mrs. Darcy has redeeming qualities is Mrs. Reynolds.  Other characters took much longer, in part because of certain inexactitudes – lies – Georgiana conveyed to them.<br /><br />Darcy is convinced the issues between his wife and his sister are being created by his wife.<br /><br />Quote from the book:  I shall observe them over the next week. If they are not then being more companionable, I shall remind Elizabeth she must make more of an effort. After all, Georgiana is young and naturally reserved, and it has been a difficult time for her. Elizabeth will have to be understanding and be the one to extend a friendly hand.<br /><br />At last … we arrive at the Hunsford Moment which in this case was at Pemberley.<br /><br />Separation follows.  What will it take for Darcy to finally see a viewpoint other than his own?<br /><br />Quote from the book:  “I do not care,” Sterling said slowly, “who her father is, or how the rest of her family acts. There is nothing wrong with Elizabeth’s manner, and, lest anyone has forgotten, let me remind you that she is Mrs. Darcy because of something Georgiana did. Elizabeth prevented Georgiana from ruining her reputation, if not her life, and dragging us all into scandal.”<br /><br />Yeah, you tell ‘em, Sterling!<br /><br />Take a moment to admire the cover art chosen for this book:  a couple sitting together but separated; a man petting his dog and ignoring his wife.  What a complete picture of the story inside!  My dog approves the concept but most of us non-canines will believe the spouse requires some attention as well.<br /><br />This is another story that has been hidden at a Fan Fiction site for years.  It is well-edited and proofread.  I applaud the author and Quills and Quartos for making this available to many more readers and recommend it to anyone who enjoys JAFF.<br /><br />I received an early copy of this book with no promise of a review, good or bad.<br /><br />The marriage of convenience has this to recommend it: we are better judges of convenience than we are of love. ~ Mignon McLaughlin",5.0,1,2020

This book is just as much garbage on the inside as it is in the outside. This book doesn’t offer any insight into yoga that you can’t find on Wikipedia, the description and how-tos of getting into a pose are abysmal. Yoga is not just “stand straight, bend over, turn left, turn right” if this was how people actually practiced you wouldn’t make it a week without injury. There are very specific things that need to go on in your body to protect your joints, muscles, ligaments, etc. There was no mention of slightly bend knees (locked knees lead to serious injury!!)

"Deja Vu All Over Again From Richard Fox, LLP","“Light the Way” is another ‘joint’ writing partnership coming from the prolific writing factory of Richard Fox, LLP.<br /><br />Joint writing ventures rarely succeed in fiction, especially sci-fi, and this endeavor proves the point. It’s ‘Deja Vu all over again’ [the great Yogi Berra], with the storyline being a lazy, lightweight and sweaty need for content rehash-driven stories. The franchise must be fed.<br /><br />Mr. Fox when writing solo, putting effort into his works, has proven to be a favorite of this reader. When he ‘phones it in’ or subcontracts, very much the opposite holds true.",2.0,0,2020
Author Lost Sight of the Book's Objective,"This historical account was trivialized by a disproportionate emphasis on the personal experiences of war correspondents covering the Korean conflict.

Great storyline,"This is a fantastic series and I've only read two of the books so far. I glanced at a few of the other reviews here. One claimed it was too long. Not a problem for me; I won't bother with a book under 300 pages even if it's free. As far as the homosexual complaint - it is an exceedingly minor aspect to the story involving two of the characters. And yeah, romantic heterosex occurs but it's certainly not pornographic. Get over it.<br /><br />I can't stress enough how entertaining it is to see the viewpoint from different perspectives. Much as in real life, good people die and others are abandoned. You've got to feel sorry for Chavos/Beggar as he's sucked into Bane's vortex. And poor, poor Jai. He tries so hard to save the slaves. You will be gobsmacked by how his story ends in this volume.<br /><br />Raven and Fire go to war.<br /><br />Roan meets Rhea. Gareth and Gwen suffer residual damage. Enough said.<br /><br />Annise grows and matures as she assume the queen's mantle.<br /><br />Grey rescues his sister. Her fatemark is still a mystery.<br /><br />I believe that covers the primary characters. The five postludes at the end are an enjoyable bonus. Heinrich was a complete unknown to me. I'm guessing we read about him as an introduction to his son, Tomas. I assume Tomas will be featured in another book. Of course Viper had been mentioned when reading about Raven so it was interesting to find out more of her history. I do have one issue in that when she was going to seduce Cadon she ""scented herself in tea tree oil."" Have you ever smelled tea tree oil? It's disgusting.<br /><br />It may have been overlooked by me in the first book, but I appreciated seeing what the various fatemarks look like and reading the character's genealogy.<br /><br />Last but not least, this is one of the few books I have recently perused where there were no blatant spelling or grammatical errors. Well done.",5.0,1,2020

"Could NOT finish and will not read book 4, even though I have it","I totally do not understand the high reviews.  Once again, book 3 is about child torture – placed in cages, whipped, starved, placed in coffins for 3 days without food water (at least Sara can rest!); mother allows “king” her son to be taken to the dungeon and she leaves him there. Protector brother, mother queen, sister, none of them stayed with him, yet Janner hoped he (King/little 11 yr old brother) wasn’t beaten while he was held prisoner.  King brother is frightened and his whole family deserts him!!!!  GRRRR.  And the mother is QUEEN! More jealousy in this book and lack of brothers sticking together although every now and then they stand beside one another.  I didn’t like Artham leaving and it made no sense in the storyline as he is a protector.  He just flies away.  Then let’s bring characters into the story and then kill them off – why bring them in at all? I’m not sure I can even finish this dark, depressing book.  I keeping feeling annoyed and angry at the storyline.  There are no down moments of Love, Joy, Family, Faith – just moments of peril that are endless.  I guess that is supposed to make an exciting plot.  But I’m not excited at all.  This book and all its darkness just makes me feel bad, sad, annoyed, and I can’t believe I read so much of it.",1.0,0,2020
"A lone-wolf, tough-guy, bad-attitude, rebel-with-a-cause, pretty-boy, mutant ... scholar?","I like Martha Wells’ novels and “City of Bones” includes a lot of the reasons why. She’s adept at describing fight scenes--not too long, not too short, just enough detail to make them exciting, precise tactics and moves. Her imagination combines the familiar (plants, animals, personalities) with the unusual (tech, magic, critters) in interesting, unusual ways. This time, it’s a post-volcanapocalyptic Earth (?) where vertical cities (in physical levels and human castes) cling to the edges of a poisonous lava desert teeming with venomous predators (human and animal) on the prowl for unwary travelers as life-sucking  “ghosts” haunt the air and alleyways where legitimate and larcenous relic hunters ferret out bits and pieces of the shattered past under the gaze of magically endowed enforcers … so far, so good, if well within the standard fantasy boundaries. Our primary protagonist Khat seems to fit in those boundaries quite well, too--the lone-wolf, tough-guy, bad-attitude, rebel-with-a-cause, pretty-boy mutant with a sarcastic attitude, excellent knife skills, and light fingers. Until it turns out that he’s also an intellectually curious and genuinely dedicated scholar of the past, to the point that even during high-stress situations he’s noticing the details of an ancient fresco or shards of an antique machine, risking his life to preserve an ancient history tome. Ms. Wells is unique in my experience in how well she captures and values the pursuit and love of learning, creating scholar characters that feel real and rich. She’s also one of the few who include companions and friends who are sincerely attached to (and sometimes sincerely annoyed and amused by) the loner-hero they help and put up with despite his emotional constipation. “City of Bones” is a stand-alone story, and while the world, history, society, and characters were intriguing but roughly sketched enough to make me want more details (hence the one-star-off rating), it’s a great ride and a fun read.",4.0,1,2020
Just What I Needed,"I've been reading Grisham for a long time now.  Say what you will about his literary chops, one thing is clear: the man can tell a story!<br /><br />Grisham has spent however many years writing every morning. That kind of discipline has to result in some development of craft, and it's never been more evident that he's achieved mastery than in CAMINO WINDS.  It reads smooth as a fine scotch. His prose is so well-assembled that the joinery is nearly invisible. The plot hums along. The characters live and breathe, fleshed out by intriguing tics and flaws. There's a sinister scandal involving nursing homes that provides the impetus for much of the action, including a contract killing.<br /><br />While I've found it difficult in this moment to do much long-form reading (friends have told me they have similar issues) I was able to drop right into CAMINO WINDS.  I found it delightful, diverting, and highly entertaining. Give it a shot.<br /><br />And you know, when you think about how absurdly much you spend on toilet paper or paper towel, a hardcover novel (especially a really good one) is a paper product that delivers incredible value and stays on your shelf even after it's consumed!",5.0,1,2020

Thoroughly engaging and thrilling story!,"One can always expect wonderful stories from K.J. Charles. Fast paced and suspenseful plot that was led by an array of diverse multifaceted characters and a story full of dry humor and hilarious quips that kept me intrigued until the end.<br /><br />At some point I both loved and hated the MCs, Kim and Will, as well as cursed at them and wanted to give them a hug. While Will was a bit more straightforward and at times quite transparent in his actions, Kim was a bit of an enigma, always step ahead of me figuring him out. I liked how different both men were, and I do not talk about their social standing, it was everything else - their principles, how they thought and acted, but at the same time they meshed so well together - Kim the rebel aristocrat and Will the proper book shop owner. But when they came together they were very improper and very passionate.<br /><br />The story follows the events that keep the questions coming, make unexpected turns and throw one for a loop. I loved how things just kept coming, how everything kept happening without letting me get stuck or bored. I enjoyed it thoroughly. There were two strong female characters that were so likable and at times funny and sweet. I loved both Phoebe and Maisie, and I hope they will be heavily featured in the coming books. There is something the author is hinting about there, but we will see. Fantastic read, and I can't wait to dig into the next chapter of Will Darling and Kim Secretan's wild adventures!",5.0,1,2020

Confusion Reigns,"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars for this book on the first page.  It needed an editor who knows the difference between set and sit, to start with.  I highlighted about 30 places where the editing took a nose dive. Sorry, but that's the way it is.  I am a technical reader. I want the plot to be CLEAR, not confused.  I want the characters to be well developed and to stay true to themselves.  But on top of all that, I want to NOT have re-read sentences that contain, not just typos, but silly, teenage grammatical errors.  I also want a book that is written to an audience older than 20.<br /><br />The term Steamy Contemporary Romance no longer means anything, if this book is to be considered. Sort of steamy, but incredibly teenagerish, if that's a word.  I know part of it is because the main characters fell in love when they were teenagers and the story continues from there, but there were spots where I was unable to tell that Whitney wasn't 17 again.  Her best moves were when she would do something, then say to herself, oh I shouldn't have done that.  Right...someone who has been married for ten years and has two kids but can't find her butt with both hands.  Someone who avoids sex with her husband, by lying, but can't find the will to leave him. Someone who watches her oldest daughter be bullied by her father, but does nothing to stop it.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars here because I'm feeling generous, but I have no clue what book the five star reviews read. In the hands of a better writer and a better editor, this would have been a knock-out of a story, but slim plotting in places, combined with lackadaisical editing and characters that just couldn't grow up, tanked it.",3.0,0,2020
Slow,Really refreshing to read a novel that is (presumably?) not by an American author and not peppered with 'Americanisms'.<br />The author can draw out a tale but this one moves very slowly and incorporates technical data which will only be appreciated by those interested in that particular aspect of guns and the British-style of hunting.,3.0,0,2020

Good read,"I had read the original Bat-21 book years ago.  It was very interesting to read this book by an impartial third-party. A few of the revelations about what really did or didn't happen were eye-opening. Yet, those revelations didn't diminish what was accomplished.  This book perhaps even enhances those accomplishments in my mind.<br /><br />Also incredibly interesting was the parallel stories of the those who tried to save the airman; some of whom scarified their own lives.  if I were asked to choose which book tells the story better, hands down, this would be the one.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that in a few places (not many) the narrative seems to drag on a bit.

"Good, with some caveats","Two soap/telenovela stars come together to film a series on a streaming service (modeled after Netflix). There's instant and believable chemistry, but they both have fears. She's famous for bad judgment with men and doesn't trust herself, and he has near-PTSD from a stalker attack that endangered his little boy. How they navigate their barriers to get to the happy-ever-after is a pretty good read, but there were a couple of things about this book that stop me from giving it a higher rating. First, the good: both main characters were really likeable, and it was nice to see a workplace depicted with so much camaraderie and friendship. The descriptions of working on a set were interesting. The sexual encounters were hot. The karaoke scene was awesome. The ending was satisfying.<br /><br />However, there were some negatives. For one thing, the constant soapboxing over diversity was too much. Next, it's hard to believe Ashton would want superstardom while thinking he can keep his family a secret. Lastly, their first sexual encounter had a weird, unromantic twist.<br /><br />But in spite of the negatives, this was an entertaining story.",3.0,0,2020
A German Tanker’s View,"I thought this would make for very interesting reading as there are comparatively few first person writings on this topic from the perspective of a German tanker. He was fortunate to have served in the best of these tanks, which were usually superior to those he faced in combat.<br /><br />The book starts off well and details his training at the outbreak of the European conflict.  His early time as a tanker and his participation in the invasion of Russia is quite remarkable. But after his initial wounds, the book becomes more terse.<br /><br />Unlike Guy Sajer’s book, the author does not elicit empathy.  His writing is largely devoid of personal emotion or introspection. He claims no knowledge of the Holocaust and despite his participation in the retreat from Russia, does not acknowledge the scorched earth policy or crimes against the Russian population. The attempted assassination of Hitler provokes nary a comment.<br /><br />That said, the book is worth reading and the photographs are good. Unfortunately, the maps are in German and did not prove helpful.",3.0,0,2020
A vomit of social justice issues,"This is an assault of every the populist agenda items the author could muster.

A memoir of walking and the spiritual insights gained,"I'm an avid walker and was very interested in what Buchanan had to say about walking. I was intrigued by his comments on religions and physical disciplines. So many religions have such a discipline associated with it (yoga, tai chi, karate, etc.). But what about Christianity? Buchanan suggests walking. He notes that God walked in the garden, Enoch and Noah walked with God, Micah 6:8 instructs us to walk humbly with our God. Buchanan suggests walking as symbolic of knowing God.<br /><br />In general, this book is a memoir. Buchanan shares his insights from his own walking experiences, from Bible passages, from books he's read and movies he's seen.<br /><br />A favorite part of this book was when Buchanan realized that, rather than walking with God, he was studying maps (theology, doctrine, etc.). He could talk maps with others and debate maps. But he found he was walking less and less with God. (Loc. 318/2398)<br /><br />Another favorite story was when his under driving age son did serious damage to their van. His wife suggested he go for a walk rather than explode at his son. He did. His mind cleared. His heart softened. God started to speak to him and he gained great insight into his own character. (Loc 1769/2398) That gave new meaning to the advice, take a walk.<br /><br />This is a good book for Christians who want to explore the concept of walking and what it can mean to spiritual life and formation. You'll be encouraged to slow down, observe, greet others, pray, and more.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",4.0,1,2020
Dark Shadows Fan - Best book out there,"Having just watched Dark Shadows through 50 years later, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, as crazy as the stories were.  It was like watching an ""acting troupe from New York"" as they all played multiple parts, they time traveled, the gothic sets and clothing were beautiful and it was just a hoot.<br /><br />Having grown up during the 60s and 70s, I was fascinated by who these actors were and this is the book that tells you about everyone in the cast.  It was a great read and I find myself going back to it on occasion as I still dip into Dark Shadows when I'm looking to just ""vegetate"" in front of the Tv.",5.0,1,2020
A great message with a journey to find inner peace. ,"Christian fiction is not a genre I spend much time in, as I often find most stories in this bracket pushy or religious to a degree that takes away from the actual plot or characters. Loubier finds a balance, though, and keeps the story moving. He does a great job maintaining the balance that many authors in Christian fiction miss: you can’t be too preachy and still tell a relatable story to people outside your faith.<br /><br />I found myself enjoying the story more than I thought it would. The beginning is a bit fast-paced, but there are periods where the story slows down quite a bit. Isaiah is a character that comes to life in the pages.<br /><br />Even if you find yourself outside of the Christian faith, this book has a good overall message about finding something that matters to you, and letting that warmth flourish and grow through the murk until hope shines through. I never thought this kind of thing would be my (slow brewing) cup of tea, but I’m glad I read it.",4.0,1,2020
Heartbreaking!,"I cried thru most of this book. I cried for the little girl, cloaked in her seeming ""invisibility"" to the adults in her family who rarely showed her love of any kind. I grieved for the teenager, desperate for friendship, love, acceptance, and trusting the wrong people. I felt the desperation of the young wife and mother, betrayed by young men who vowed to love and cherish her, but failed to live up to their promises, instead crushing her hopes and dreams with their cruelty and indifference. Ms. Conn is a gifted writer. She made me see her, feel her pain, her hopes and dreams, and her endless disappointments. Through her her painful revelations, I found myself longing for her to finally trust her own sense of self-worth; to stop listening to the inner voice that told her it was her fault, that she was not worthy of life, love, and respect. Her struggle to survive in a culture that seems hell bent on destroying itself is a testament to her courage, determination, self actualization, and resolve to break the cycle with her own children.  Reading this book helped me to understand, if only a little bit, why people like my youngest sister, or my drug-addicted son, make the choices they do, and why they keep going back to the same circle of friends, the same old neighborhoods, the same destructive habits, and the same recurring results. I'm still hoping for them to do what Bobi did. We are all prisoners of our environments but we don't have to be. Everyone should read this book before they cast the first stone!",5.0,1,2020

Explica que la primer democracia duro menos de 200 años y que no hubo otra verdadera democracia que funcionara, sino hasta la democracia America en 1776 a miles de años de distancia.  La democracia de Atenas fallo porque: 1. La ignorancia del pueblo, 2. La demagoga de los politicos, 3. Los altos impuestos para sostener lo que el llama ""la clientela electoral"" a la que hay que comprarla adulandola y 4. La intervencion externa. La segunda parte del libro habla de La Agenda Globalista, como se impone y sus simbolos. Explica que la guerra de ideas ya no es entre derecha e izquierda, ni entre el capitalismo y Marxismo, sino que es entre el Patriotismo contra el Globalismo, los que defienden la soverania nacional, contra los que quieren un gobierno internacionalista, o globalista.

NOTHING TOO IMAGINATIVE ... EASY READING TO PASS TIME,"With the Coronovirus keeping any intelligent person home, my Kindle has become my best friend. Reading through the reviews, it seems small and petty that anyone can object to a protagonist who is an atheist, as well as another character who is transgender. As long as the book is well enough written to have a passable plot and is at least true to the storyline, not to mention being well proofed, it should just be judged on its literary merits. While I found this author to be lacking in imagination, I found this book true to its genre . Possibly the reader who got so upset because of the atheist protagonist and the transgender side kick should be more worried about the total lack of leadership in the handling of Covid 19. When a president doesn't even know what the 19 stands for, puts in a cabinet for its ability to pander directly to him, separates families and loses the parents...well, everyone is given the right of free speech in this country.

This book let me cry once again.,"I've read so many PNR, historical, and modern-day romance shorts/novellas/novels that it's getting hard to grab my emotional heart strings. However, Naomi did manage to manipulate my heart that I used to wear on my sleeve, and I highly appreciate her for this.<br /><br />I've always been curious about Cypher. In her previous books, he seemed to be fairly gregarious for a cyborg shifter, yet I knew he was hiding a lot behind his man-made visage. I was very curious how Ms. Lucas was going to characterize him and his transformation from the hibernating hermit to the raging/ravaging bear that is his animal. She did an excellent job without having him reflect yet another same-old same-old which I wasn't going to put up with. Naomi has been able to shape her cyborg alphas into singular heroes with a butt-load of problems and short-comings to match their larger-than-life personae. So how did Cypher rate? Fabulous! Fantastic! Fearsome! Frickin' awesome! And I appreciate the cover doesn't have him be the same-old same-old I've been seeing for the past several years — bare torso/abs without a head. You know what I'm talking about. Instead, I'm seeing one great bear of a guy with a short, curvy, young thing practically climbing all over him. I certainly would.<br /><br />The only thing missing is The Cat.<br /><br />Vee Miles is a virtual reality gamer. But before you write her off as another alternative reality loser for not being able to deal with the reality originally given to her, this is a far different game. Better than a world-building game. Better than Dungeons & Dragons. An interesting way to preplan future human colonization, especially with the Trentian Empire and Earth barely glaring at each other civilly after a hundred-year war where Earth practically wiped out every Trentian female. She's been itching to play in the annual Terraform Zero virtual reality colonization game which would earn her fame and fortune should she be smart enough and mentally agile enough. Unfortunately, she left home after she refused to go to college, and instead of seeking a career or get married (not many options left for human women on a post-war Earth), she hasn't been able to join a Terraform Zero gaming team, so she's been a loner. And she still needed a sponsor to cover the expenses she no longer could. Enter Nightheart and EPED who choses to become her sponsor... if she agrees to team up with a cyborg.<br /><br />Nightheart says he needs to improve PR for cyborgs since the Zeph fiasco. (See Chaos Croc.) Right now, sympathy for the once über-heroic cyborg is at an all-time low. Now the problem is to coax Cypher out of Ghost City, a wandering, secretive spaceport without a system, where the ursine has been on/off hibernating on the outside while monitoring the goings-on of the safe haven for all approved cyborgs. So he has Vee ""out"" the ursine, but to the angry bear's ire.<br /><br />I found this story line to be quite riveting on more than one level. There were so many times Ms. Lucas could have resorted to one of many easy ""outs"" when it came to plots and subplots. The last thing I wanted this story to be was predictable! Fortunately, she avoided more than a few pitfalls. She could have spent a ton of time dealing with the Terraform Zero gaming system as it would had been a fascinating ""story-within-a-story"", but really, would this had been necessary? From an editor's point of view, not really. But trying to pull that off would had been difficult to make believable without being predictable. THAT would had been an entire novel of its own, but would it had advanced the actual relationship?<br /><br />Some people might have issues with the sex or its overall lack of details, to which I must disagree. There is a healthy balance of sex and intimacy whereas there is plenty of angst (but not necessarily too frustrating or self-serving angst). It's definitely difficult, being the seventh book, to be sexually original without being boringly repetitive. In my eyes, that's like being Eva Gabor's seventh husband. You know what to do but how do you make it interesting? I don't want to see gratuitous sex where I need to fast-forward over the sexy times part until I get to something more interesting. That's a waste of space as well as my time. Intrigue me otherwise. Some people might misinterpret Cipher's aggression to that of nonconsensual sex, but don't jump to conclusions so readily. Just read through and see how things truly end up. I didn't come across any triggers unless there's an issue of losing one's virginity especially traumatic. (Makes you wonder about the evolutionary imperative of a hymen.)<br /><br />World-building about world-building is there, but it does more to answer questions from previous books rather than establish huge, new vistas. I think it does set up the continuing series for future conflict with the Trentians because I think we're due for some major face-offs with them. With all these cyborg shifters pairing off with human females, will Earth be ready for renewed aggressions with their archenemies? I don't think so unless there are more cyborg shifters in the making.<br /><br />I'll be waiting for the next in the series because I am anxious to see how things go, not only with Cipher and Vee, but with newly parentals Dommik and Katalina, Reid and Clara, and Netto and Rylie.

"Enjoyable read, honest and interesting autobiography","I really liked this book. The Go Gos were one of my favorite bands from my college days. I had read Belinda Carlisle's autobiography, and was intrigued by get recollections. This book was a little more personal and more illuminating, in my opinion. Kathy Valentine always seemed mysterious to me, and I think her book really painted a good picture of who she is. She is one talented guitar and bass player! It's a really entertaining read, is by no means pretentious, and showcases the complete dysfunctionality of the Go Gos in their heyday. I knocked off one star because the ending seemed really rushed. But I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to know more about the band or Kathy",4.0,1,2020
Good Suspense/Thrillers,I enjoyed all three books and the bonus book in this set thoroughly. I had a hard time putting my Kindle down. I can't wait to read the next Box Set.

This is up there as one of my favorite reads,"How exciting it is to find a really talented author, which certainly describes Alec Hutson. Reading this trilogy I could not help comparing his writing style to George R. R. Martin. He paints a vivid illustration of his world using a vocabulary that is above the typical junior high level I find with many of the self-published Amazon books. His characters are believable and the action is paced so that I don't want to put the book down once started. This is one of the most enjoyable series I've read the past several years and I am eagerly looking forward to more work from Mr. Hutson.",5.0,1,2020

Wonderful new series,"The Water Viper is the beginning of  great new dystopian series.  The premise of ""falling sky stones""changing and remaking the world is brilliant.  The fact the event happened in 1992, is even better.  Our heroine is an assassin in the beginning chapters of the book.  She is really, really good at her profession and has morals which she relies on in her work.  Did I mention that most people in this new world are shifters or truely mystical people.  If you give this first book a read you will become engrossed in the characters and their world.  I love this book.",5.0,1,2020
Wait a minute...,"I was enjoying The  Audible  version of this summer novel about the four daughters of a famous, larger-than-life, egotistical, alcoholic writer who - big surprise - leaves them in a huge mess upon his sudden death.<br /><br />I was interested in how the sisters were working things out, despite the fact that they were frequently childishly mean to each other and the fourth sister.  The middle sister, Maggie, could be just obnoxious in her certainty of her own rightness, and worse, her own cuteness.  Plus she was openly greedy,<br /><br />That said, in reference to Maggie’s hard-working, line cook (a LINE cook? both other sisters say,) boyfriend, Trisha says,<br /><br />“I didn’t know people named Yablonsky had trust funds.”<br /><br />I was stunned.  What kind of ugly snobbery is that?  And a lawyer (as Trisha is) should know that anyone can go to a bank, see a trust officer and set up a trust fund.  Anyone.<br /><br />Spoiler...<br /><br />In the end, and really I considered stopping after that point, my sympathies were with the outsider sister. She was anything but pushy, she was insulted by her father, she was snubbed by her mother, and the only person she could really count on was the father who reared her.  The three sisters left her out of the final financial meetings, and she was right. Nobody ever asked her how she was feeling. That she ingratiated herself as much as she did was a tribute to her.<br /><br />This is where my husband says, “Honey, it’s a book.”<br /><br />True, true. But that Yablonsky quote showed the character’s? the author’s? true colors. How can this still go on?",2.0,0,2020

Could have been three novels,"This is an epic novel with a cast of thousands and adventures across and through many obstacles. I had trouble becoming engaged in this novel. The characters did not grab me. Jack started off being disgusting and lost my respect. Peter is being made to go on the adventure. I liked the adventure loving nature of Hannah but even she was going to avoid something else. So I found the character motivation lacking.<br /><br />I got bogged down in the story and had to force myself to keep reading. There were some action scenes early on but I felt like I was watching action from a distance, not really drawn into the suspense. The action and suspense increased greatly near the end.<br /><br />My greatest displeasure with the book was the many plot lines. There is Selena's story yet within that plot are narratives from usually two and sometimes three different places. Then there is the plot line involving Jack and Peter and Hannah. There are at least three different narratives there. About half way through the book we begin to see an intersection of all of the narratives yet still alternate narratives. Sometimes even the time period changes. Here are chapter numbers and the dates: 53-February 17, 54-March 2, 55-March 20, 56-March 3, 57-March 20, 58-March 24, 59-March 5, 62-April 13, 63-March 12. Not only did the narrative view points and locations change, so did the dates. That was just too much.<br /><br />And this is a long book, over 1000 pages. This work is likened to Tolkien's but his books are 350 to 450 pages. I think a better approach to this work would have been three books. First would be Selena's story, then Peter, Jack and Hannah's story, and then when their narratives combined. And these 1000 pages are just the first in a series, we find out at the end. Another possibility would have been to have about 200 pages cut from this novel. There were descriptions and scenes I felt did not move the plot forward and could have been eliminated.<br /><br />I agreed to read and review this book or I don't think I would have finished it. It would be a good choice for readers who like being immersed in an alternative world with many plot lines, lots of battles, alternating narratives, speaking animals, people who have healing visions, and much more.<br /><br />I received a complimentary digital galley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",3.0,0,2020
Edge of the seat page turner?,"A man, seemingly well to do, is driving with a young woman, desperately holding on to her baby boy, penniless, trying to run away from a catastrophic threat. The man picked her up at an airport, and now driving with her, after paying for her airline ticket, to a bread and breakfast at a resort place.<br />Each chapter is a description, alternately, of their feelings, and how they look at the situation they are in.<br />The fundamental psychological makeup of the man is his interest in two things: sex and booze. The young woman, despite the baby, is satisfying his first need above and beyond his expectations. For that, albeit with utter annoyance about the child, is willing to pay for the fun.<br />The woman, whose lifeline, and her only connection to the world, is the baby. For the baby, and for not having any resources on the run (we still don't know from what), she is willing to do everything and anything to please her ""savior.""<br />That got me ""turning the page,"" although never at the edge of my seat, to location 497. I don't know what page that would be, but the end of the ""thriller"" is location 3348. So, one can get a page approximation. The reader showed 14% of the book.<br />After quitting at that point, I was wondering what could have been more waste of my time. My best bet was the phone book.

A must-read if you enjoyed Summer of '69...,"A very cute revisit to the Foley-Levin clan, the family first introduced in the Summer of '69. Exalta, the matriarch, has passed away at age 84, and the family once again comes together on Nantucket for her funeral. From there, we get some form of closure for every member of the family.<br /><br />Unlike a few other reviewers, I actually enjoyed the popular cultural references. This story isn't meant to be timeless, it's meant to solely depict the summer of '79...hence, the title.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Summer of '69, I'd definitely suggest reading this novella as well.",3.0,0,2020

"Overwritten, poorly thought out, needs major editing.....","I could probably spend a couple of hours deconstructing this book and all the issues I have with it.  The sad thing is that the author is extremely talented.  He has an idea, and he can even make it come to life better than most authors I've run into.<br /><br />So why such a bad score when I like the author's talent.<br /><br />To put it simply, the author fails to consider his audience at all.  And he even telegraphs that before the book starts by having a foreword that was more about justifying his writing than introducing himself to a potential reader.<br /><br />And it goes from there.  The hero isn't very heroic at the start, whines a little (although far less than many MCs I run into recently) and then becomes a passenger in the book, rarely showing initiative.  The early ""training"" is a complete joke that couldn't have occurred under any plausible circumstances.  (I won't  say more because *spoilers*, but it was poorly thought out and unrealistic in far too many ways.)<br /><br />The plot wasn't the only problem.  The author in his foreword mentions that he likes to provide readers with a large number of longer than average chapters in his books.  That's wonderful, but not if there are pages of fluff used to pad the chapter length.  A good example is right after our less than heroic hero ends up taming his first two witches.  I can't quantify the number of repetitive lines, paragraphs and even scenes that follow.  The two witches repeat themselves constantly over the next few chapters, and most of it should have forced the ""hero"" to ask sharp and clear questions, but sharp and clear would make the chapters much tighter.<br /><br />In all, the author needs a very strict and businesslike editor who can cut, slash and trim all of the extra words down to a story that feels far more visceral than the pedestrian slog this book quickly becomes.  I can't recommend this to anyone, even lovers of the genre, so it gets a 2 star from me.  I think the author can write much better, but in this case his failure to keep the story focused forces me to give it a very log score.",2.0,0,2020
"Before you do anything else, READ THIS BOOK!!! (1,000,000 STARS!)","What an INCREDIBLE story! Katarina is right. God (not mentioned in the book) gave everyone talents for the job they were created to do. Sometimes it's hard for us to know exactly what our talent(s) might be. Part of this is that we honestly don't know. We may recognize we're good at something but, like Evelyn, we don't recognize it as a talent. For instance, I used to send cards to people: birthday, thinking of you, missed you, get well, etc. It was just something I did. (Well, I still do, but now they're usually e-cards.) I never thought of it as a talent. However, that is really what it is: I have the gift of encouragement.<br /><br />Another part of the problem is that we think we know what we want to be - what we want to do with our lives. I thought I wanted to be a doctor. Even took certain classes with that in mind. However, when it came time for college I realized that when I got married and had kids, I was going to stay home with them. Since I would have stopped working as a doctor I decided not to spend all those years and dollars to be one. I wanted to be a nurturer - to my children. So I switched to becoming a music teacher: I taught piano and voice in a studio while I was in high school. I could continue to give private lessons at home and still be a mother: teacher AND nurturer!<br /><br />What I didn't appreciate was the fact that God gave me the gift of words. I began writing a LOT of poetry way back in junior high school. Kept at it until I was so busy with my own children AND foster children that I just didn't have time to hole up in my room and write. So I stopped. But even then I often questioned why God would create me to be a poet: I certainly couldn't make a living at that, and most people don't like poetry anyway. So while I recognized the gift it wasn't a gift I wanted.<br /><br />Eventually we retired and settled in a gated community here in the forest. God moved us here to a specific house He had picked out just for us. Literally. When my husband was repainting and recarpeting our home in TX to sell, I was here in AR unpacking. Finally I thought I wasn't ever going to find a place to put everything so I told God I was ready: put me to work doing whatever it was He had brought me here to do. A few days later I knew EXACTLY what was happening when I started having what I had always called those ""ramblings in my brain."" I got out my pen and paper and began writing. And writing and writing and writing! Hundreds of poems so far! And I pulled out my other notebooks: it had been 19 1/2 years since I had written even one line of poetry!<br /><br />Point is: God knew EXACTLY what He created me to do. He knew what talents I would need. And that's what gifts He gave me! He knew the purpose for the gift whether I did or not. It was the gift I got whether I wanted it - whether I appreciated it - or not.<br /><br />It is the same with you and everyone else. EVERYONE has a gift! We may need to DEVELOP our gift (my poetry is certainly better and touches more people than it did in the eighth grade), but it is still what we are given. Maybe you need to find your Katarina - your friend or relative who sees your talents. Someone who sees in you what you cannot see. Someone who will encourage you to become what you were made to be.<br /><br />I LOVED this book. It isn't just for children: it is for every person on the planet! Get a copy, read it, and share it with everyone you know! It will be one of the best things you ever do for them. I absolutely believe that!",5.0,1,2020

I adore the additions to the team and how their personalities compliment the others.  This book was a roller coaster of awesome. Yes, I totally teared up a few times and loved it.  This series is top of my must read list. Oh, I think I’m becoming a cat person after this!",5.0,1,2020
Great for escapism,"The first time I read this book was somewhere around 1993-1995, when I was a teenager and well before I had taken any biochemistry or genetics classes.  That was a very long time ago, and my memory of this book was probably warped by seeing the movie quite a few times in the years in between.<br /><br />Reading it through for the second time, as an adult, I find this book immensely fun, but there are some problems.<br /><br />The dinosaurs are genetically engineered to need L-lysine, so that if they leave the island, they won’t die.  For them, it is an essential amino acid, so it is added to their foods.  Guess who also must consume L-lysine because we can’t make it ourselves!  That’s right, humans.  All essential amino acids are readily available in meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy.  Lysine is available in soy, black beans, quinoa, and pumpkin seeds, and chances are many more plants available to dinosaurs that made it off island.  But, for the meat eaters, all meat has lysine in it… so I’m not really sure why this was ever thought to be a “good idea”.  Michael Crichton with his medical school background surely must have known that lysine was an essential amino acid for humans, and while difficult, it isn’t top of the list for vegans to supplement like Vitamin B12.<br /><br />How DNA is talked about…. as a piece of DNA.  Presumably, dinosaur genomes comprised a certain number of chromosomes, each species may have had different numbers, such as humans have 46, chimpanzees have 48, it is mostly the same stuff but split up on the different chromosomes.  In order to “make a dinosaur”, or anything from a starting genome, you must have a way for that genetic material to replicate once you inject a genome into an egg that has had the original genetic material blasted out.  You can’t just put in one long piece of DNA, you need sites to initiate chromosome replication, you need centrosomes and telomeres.  A lot of times, these are very similar on different chromosomes, and assembling a whole genome takes a lot more effort than what was described here.<br /><br />Ugh... the thriller trope with a very young, attractive female scientist (24?) who is an expert in her field, while the male scientists are all mid to late 30s or 40s.  And… she is given absolutely nothing to do.  She is the only adult woman for almost the entire book (there are some adult women at the beginning).  I know this was written at a different time, but geez this could have been better.<br /><br />“When you compared the DNA of man to the DNA of a lowly bacterium, you found that only about 10 percent of the strands were different.”  Um nope.  This isn’t true now, this wasn’t true in 1990 when this book was published, this has never been true.  Some genes overlap, some DNA bounces back and forth between human (or animals) and bacteria, but the genetic material is VERY DIFFERENT in prokaryotes versus eukaryotes.  Humans have close to 50% genes in common with a banana, last common ancestor 2 Billion years ago.  Humans share around 80% of DNA with fish (last common ancestor 375 Million years ago), and humans share 98% DNA with chimpanzees (last common ancestor ).  So… this 10 percent “different strands” is way out there, even if we were living in a world where dinosaur DNA could be obtained and then used to make some dinos.  (This stuff erks me, just like typos in books.)<br /><br />All the computer charts and navigating menus… which makes up a big part of the book and hasn’t aged well.  Velociraptors are attacking and a kid is trying to figure out what buttons to push to turn on the electric fences.  I know this was supposed to be riveting climactic stuff, but pushing buttons on a computer just doesn’t get me on the edge of my seat these days.<br /><br />Anyway, I’ve decided to rate it 5 stars, because I read this during the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when I was feeling very nervous about an upcoming surgery, so I needed some escapism and this was a great book for that.",5.0,1,2020
These keep getting shorter and more pointless. This is not worth $10,"It's 200 pages. Probably 150 of that is Rudeus talking about how sad he is. Not joking. He's sad about Eris.

Merry Folger Revisited,"I was delighted to stumble upon a new Merry Folger Nantucket mystery after so many years.  I had read the early books long ago, and while browsing mysteries, I saw this new one, hoping it wasn't a reprint of an old title.  No indeed, it was a recent book.  Having spent many summers on Martha's Vineyard and visiting Nantucket sporadically, it was a pleasure to ""visit"" the Cape and Islands once again with the addition of learning a bit about Tuckernuck, that elusive island.  I enjoyed the complex plot with many story lines, a fault to some reviewers. The shipwreck and the intrigue surrounding it, Merry's upcoming wedding plans, and hurricane Teddy were all of interest to me.  Having ridden out a nasty nor' easter in the area, the storm was particularly well depicted, in my view.  I do hope Ms. Matthews will grace readers with another such tale.",4.0,1,2020
"Wonderful, Feel Good Emotions","The Day She Came Back is the newest release from one of my top-five favorite authors, Amanda Prowse. The Queen of Domestic Drama and a prolific writer of emotionally charged contemporary fiction has another hit on her hands, and I am thrilled to share an early review. I have read all of her works from the last five years and plan to shuffle my way back through the earlier ones I missed, before I knew anything about her.<br /><br />Imagine being an eighteen-year-old girl in England, raised by your much older grandmother because your own parents died from drug overdoses. You lost your grandfather years ago, you have no siblings or aunts and uncles, and you're a bit of an outcast at school. But you're sweet, and you are generous, and you have so much potential. At least you have a wonderful best friend and a lovely little crush on a boy at school... perhaps life might be okay... until your nana, Prim, passes away unexpectedly. How tragic and sad, and it breaks your heart. But then... everything changes the following days at nana's funeral. Someone you thought long gone shows up with a shocking twist!<br /><br />Prowse knows how to lure you into comfortable nostalgia and love... she makes you feel the true pain of a young girl who now has no one to help her through the grief. Sure, she has a bestie and her family, and her nana's beau, but it's not the same. I felt my eyes tear up when Victoria was home alone for the first time... you know things can't possibly be okay again for her. She is alone in the world now. I understood her reckless behavior, her desire to be someone different. Victoria shows us the downside of being heartbroken on multiple levels, and then... finally, we see a glimmer of hope. The crush seems to return her feelings!<br /><br />As quickly as we feel the pain, our hopes rise and we see the potential for Victoria to heal. But it won't happen, and things will take a very long time to truly turn around. Prowse paints the characters with just enough detail to give you all you need to take the picture and run with it yourself. I heard the music at the party Victoria throws. I smelled the breakfasts she and her crush make each morning. I felt the change in this young woman when she is hurt a second time by someone who devastates her in a terrible way.<br /><br />It's rare others than Prowse can generate this kind of emotion from me... but when she does, I am all in. I can't wait to find out what's next in this dynamic author's mind.",5.0,1,2020
Weaves together two stories: a murder mystery & Marconi’s contributions to wireless communications,"The book entitled: “Thunderstruck” by Erik Larson was another enjoyable and entertaining book by Erik Larson.  I highly recommend purchasing and reading it.  It is a work of nonfiction written as if it were a novel.  It weaves together two stories one of a murder mystery and the other of the story of Marconi and his contributions to wireless communications over many years around the year 1900.  It will have a particular appeal to those with an interest in engineering and science and the continuing debate over whether theory or application are the fast way to improve technical products.  As one of the valuable aspects of Marconi’s work involved ship to shore communications, which were later also valuable in at sea rescues this book will also have appeal to those who have sailed on the high seas in the military or as cruise passengers and those who are aware of the work of the international ice patrol. The book also introduces one to the value of patents both obtaining and defending them internationally and early examples of how start-up ventures worked in the UK.<br /> Because I had read other books by Erik Larson, I selected this one after tiring of reading the umpteenth book on politics leading up to the November 2020 elections in the US.  As it turns out, I had switched almost entirely to reading books on my Kindle app and was pleased when I discovered Amazon.com would alert me if I had already purchased and downloaded a title.  When I purchased this book copyrighted in 2006, it was not flagged as previously purchased but as I started to read it the story line was very familiar and lo and behold, I had purchased and still had a hardcover copy of the book.  As I continued to read my Kindle version, I was reminded of how well Larson writes and how much interesting and entertaining technical detail he provides in his stories.  This book is well worth purchasing and reading … even twice.<br /> One of Marconi’s competitors was one with a strong academic background but one who also suffered and benefited from two traits: one his willingness to consider and investigate new phenomenon (including the paranormal) and the other the curiosity to be easily distracted to follow a new lead.  Marconi in contrast was a classic experimentalist continually trying new adjustments to his equipment in the hopes of improving their performance without really any scientific understanding of why changes were leading to improvements. In the process, he comes close to bankrupting his company before later going on to win the Nobel prize.<br /> The author states: “Historians often place humankind’s initial awareness of the distinct character of electrical phenomena in ancient Greece, with a gentleman named Thales, who discovered that by rubbing amber he could attract to it small bits of things, like beard hair and lint. The Greek word for amber was elektron.<br />Initially scientists were pleased just to be able to launch a spark, as when Isaac Newton did it in 1643, but the technology quickly improved …”  Larson goes on to remind the reader that: “But it was James Clerk Maxwell who really shook things up. In 1873 in his A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism he proposed that such oscillations produced invisible electromagnetic waves, whose properties he described in a series of famous equations. He also argued that these waves were much like light and traveled through the same medium, the mysterious invisible realm known to physicists of the day as ether.” And goes on to remind the reader that: “In 1886 Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of such waves through laboratory experiments and found also that they traveled at the speed of light.”<br /> Larson goes on to state that after doing a presentation on a short distance communications demonstration that: “Lodge’s own statements about his lecture reveal that he did not think of Hertzian waves as being useful; certainly the idea of harnessing them for communication never occurred to him. He believed them incapable of traveling far—he declared half a mile as the likely limit. It remained the case that as of the summer of 1894 no means existed for communicating without wires over distances beyond the reach of sight. This made for lonely times … in the many places where wires did not reach, but nowhere was this absence felt more acutely than on the open sea, a fact of life that is hard to appreciate for later generations accustomed to the immediate world-grasp afforded by shortwave radio and cellular telephone.”<br /> Larson identified the key to Marconi’s ultimate success stating: “The true scholar-physicists, like Lodge, had concluded that waves must travel in the same manner as light, meaning that even if signals could be propelled for hundreds of miles, they would continue in a straight line at the speed of light and abandon the curving surface of the earth. … Marconi saw no limits. He fell back on trial and error, at a level of intensity that verged on obsession. It set a pattern for how he would pursue his quest over the next decade.” Moreover, Larson, explaining Marconi goes on to state: “As he worked, a fear grew within him, almost a terror, that one day he would awaken to discover that someone else had achieved his goal first. He understood that as research into electromagnetic waves advanced, some other scientist or inventor or engineer might suddenly envision what he had envisioned. … And in fact he was right to be concerned. … Scientists around the world were conducting experiments with electromagnetic waves, though they still focused on their optical qualities. Lodge had come closest, but inexplicably had not continued his research.”<br /> Larson goes on to state: “One day, by chance or intuition, Marconi elevated one of the wires of his transmitter on a tall pole, thus creating an antenna longer than anything he previously had constructed. No theory existed that even hinted such a move might be useful.<br />It was simply something he had not yet done and that was therefore worth trying. As it happens, he had stumbled on a means of dramatically increasing the wavelength of the signals he was sending, thus boosting their ability to travel long distances and sweep around obstacles. … “That was when I first saw a great new way open before me,” Marconi said later. “Not a triumph. Triumph was far distant. But I understood in that moment that I was on a good road. My invention had taken life. I had made an important discovery.””",5.0,1,2020
and I'm done,"Wow.  Hit a plot point that caused an immediate DELETE of this story.  it was that bloody bad.<br /><br />I will eventually review the first five books.  I was binge reading this series and I liked Richter to a point.  He's stupidier than he should be, isn't organized and is a passenger in the tale far more often than he should be, which I attribute to the author being unfortunately rather unskilled in creating a compelling tale without using tons of plot armor and deus ex machina tricks.<br /><br />But all that paled with one plot twist that I considered completely unforgivable.  I'm sorry, but while I accept the original premise that Richter was brought to the land to bring great change and perhaps free demons that had been trapped in this plane for ages, that doesn't forgive having him be the passenger used to constantly allow insane levels of illogic and ""epic"" fights that are only epic because they break the rules of whatever LitRPG system isn't really being used by the author.<br /><br />In the end I have to say that my growing concerns since book 3 were finally proven true in my opinion.  This author doesn't have a clear idea of what he's doing with the tale and he keeps upping the power levels to hide the lack of real plot and emotional development of his characters.  He's happy to grant them levels and skills, and to try to use that as a proxy for real story, but its been growing thin and with the plot twist that I ran into.  i'm done.  I want characters who are more than numbers on a character sheet to a game system that no one could ever play around a table.<br /><br />Sorry Aleron Kong, but you lost me with this one.",2.0,0,2020

The Practical Meaning of Fidelity and of Infidelity wrapped in a Murder Mystery,"As a follower of Thomas Perry, I DO enjoy his writing.  Characterization is strong throughout.  Plots provide for action, suspense and mystery.  ALL those qualities are present in this novel.  Traditional mystery lovers might wish for a true 'main character.'  Many characters here vie for our loyalty and attention.  Private Investigator, Phil Kramer is killed early but 'lives' throughout the novel as his approach to 'Fidelity' unfolds.  He has only been 'faithful' to women 'after his fashion' (as the saying goes.)  Has he been more faithful to his calling to uncover an evil doer?  Resolving that question is the central, long-lasting mystery in the novel.  The pretty-much single-minded 'hit man' may be the novel's central character: he is part of Kramer's assassination and his activities drive the rest of the action as he tries to get in on a big payday.  Kramer's wife/widow is the strongest female character but Caroline Forrester, wife of man with a secret, comes a very close second.  Other male and female characters are also well-drawn/imagined.  The rest of the novel's machinery is powered by suspenseful action.  Which player will do what next?",4.0,1,2020

"Loving this new series, but please stop the long exposition!","Excited to read this since Remy and Lisa's book, and it did not disappoint. I enjoyed getting to know this town and the characters, and hope we see more of the town people. Looking forward to the next installment.<br /><br />My only issue was the very tedious and long exposition passages that I noticed are becoming more prominent in Lexi Blake's books (especially her MT series which I love, but please stop with the 3 pages of inner monologue!).

The spanking (as part of foreplay) was a bit off-putting, in that nothing led up to it. It just came out of the blue, as though it was average, everyday foreplay. Um ... it's not.

2.5 frustrated stars.,"Mild spoilers ahead:<br /><br />Pepped-up is the first book of a series about Pepper Jones and her rise through high school and beyond as a running star. I don’t mind reading a series if it’s great. Here, the writing is good, the narration is excellent, but the plot made me pause. What?!<br /><br />The heroine, Pepper, a running athlete, appears to have her head on straight as long as her crush on her neighbour/high school quarterback, Jace, is kept under wraps.<br /><br />Along comes a lovely young man, Ryan, also on the running team, who is decent to Pepper, shares her interests and seems compatible in every way. We get to watch their relationship develop and he’s great. But he’s not the hero? I had to double check the blurb.<br /><br />Nope, the hero is the neighbour Jace who treats Pepper inconsiderately and engages in a reprehensible activity - unless he’s working with the police, but that’s unlikely at his age, isn’t it?<br /><br />Pepper is besotted with Jace, but her love for him developed “off page” before the book began so I’m not invested in Jace in any way. I’m TOLD about their past, I’m not SHOWN it like I am shown the relationship with Ryan.<br /><br />Therefore, as a reader I fell for the wrong guy - Ryan (who’s really the better guy at this stage). Therefore, I’m frustrated. If Pepper chooses Jace right now, I can’t respect her (even though she has so much going for her). If I don’t respect the protagonists, I can’t engage.<br /><br />That’s just me. If you’re not bothered by what irritates me, you may love this whole series.<br /><br />Will I read the rest of the series? Not unless it’s available on Audible’s Escape Package.<br /><br />Before Pepped up, I listened to Ali Dean’s THE LINE BELOW and KICK and thoroughly enjoyed both as the writing was terrific and the narration by Stacey Glemboski was excellent (as usual). I recommend those novels without hesitation. I can’t say the same for PEPPED UP. Not yet, anyway.",3.0,0,2020

"Starts Great, Then Story Falls Apart","I am typically a big fan of Jennifer Weiner and have read all of her books.  I was excited to read Big Summer and dove right in as soon as it was delivered to my IPad.  The first 1/2 to 3/4 of the book was Weiner’s typical witty, poignant, clever and descriptive writing style.  I was hooked!  Unfortunately about halfway to 1/4 remaining, the story fell apart.  It became so rushed and cheesy and non-sensical that it reminded me of a high school writing project.  The remainder of the story tumbled out at such a rapid unorganized pace that I felt the author was just trying to write “the end” and send it off to publish as quickly as possible.  The careful storyline seemed wasted and many sub-plots were left unanswered.  This will definitely be a book that I will not re-read, nor recommend to others.",2.0,0,2020

Kelly Oliver Not the Only Author of This Story,"It's very obvious that Kelly Oliver read Agatha Christie's ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles.""  I did and finished it about 2 weeks ago so the details of the Christie story were very fresh in my mind.  Then I started reading this book, the first in a series, and at first I squinted at the page, not sure of what I was reading.  As I kept turning pages, it became pretty apparent that detailed chunks of the Agatha Christie mystery were lifted.  To be sure Kelly Oliver changed the story and refocused it a bit, but there's no question where the story came from.  It's not even a matter of using the Christie mystery as a jumping off point:  Oliver would or could have said so in a prologue.  No, I'm afraid this is something else.  I wonder if she plans to base the rest of the series on other Agatha Christie mysteries that she must think no one is reading anymore?  If so, why not just go back to the source and read them for yourself?  They're really pretty well written --- and original.",1.0,0,2020

Last book a bust,"How strange.  I stopped reading Sanderson at one point because though aspects of his stories were quite good, it was just too, too sick and twisted and I realized that the good wasn't worth the sick one had to endure.  So, time went on with me avoiding anything he wrote until I happened on this trilogy where no sick was mentioned in the descriptions.  So, I decided to give it a chance, because they guy IS (or was) a good storyteller.  So, the first two books were pretty good, great characters, pretty much everything one wants in this genre, until the last book.  As I read them all back to back, I can't exactly remember where it was getting so bad I was skipping over page after page, exasperated and bored, reading just a line or two to keep up with the story.  And that was very possible--there were just SO MANY words, words, useless words, such endless drivel, pointless reflection and ceaseless wondering, wondering, wondering.  It was so annoying--I just wanted to get to the place where the ash was gone, the leaves were green and flowers appeared.  It's no spoiler to know that was going to happen.  But did it have to happen on the last page--after so much useless annoying, unsatisfying reading of boring words?  As I write this and remember the annoyance and exasperation, I'm changing the three stars to two.  I was going to give it three because the first two books were okay, but no, with such an unsatisfying end after so much annoyance, maybe even two stars is too much.  I'm not sure when this was written in Sanderson's career--I am totally giving up on him now.  How did he go from sick and twisted, but good story, to totally boring and annoying.  I'm wondering if he really wrote this.",2.0,0,2020

Not for beginners,"I just started self-studying C++ for fun.  I finished a different beginner's book and this was my second book.  I thought great, from the C++ creator himself.  Ermmmm.... 😒 This book has quite a few flaws in layout and design.  It's definitely not meant for beginners.<br /><br />Although the book starts benignly enough, you quickly realize, it's extremely verbose.  It's written as if the author loves the sound of his own voice more than effectively conveying ideas.  Maybe, that was a product of translation between Bjarne and the writer?  Not sure.  Chapter 1 for example is a word mess and almost a complete waste of time.  There were a few nuggets of an idea that was new to me, and that kept me reading on, but I felt I had to slog through 10 pages of over-verbose text describing the simplest ideas, just to get to that singular nugget of wisdom.<br /><br />Then, I started noticing increasing number of notations of ""We will cover that later in [some] chapter.""  Ugh!  Then came practice problems that appeared to have no way to solve with the given material up to that point, with no guidance even where to look for the missing information to solve that, and also ofc, the answers for the practice problems are not available in the book.  Frustration.  Lots of function calls started just appearing, that were not given explanations, just you're supposed to understand from context, and always with, ""We will cover that in chapter[]"", but ofc, if you go to that much-later chapter, you'd have to read the whole chapter to understand, but you can't understand that chapter because you have to read all the previous chapters up to that point.  Ugh.  Starting to see the problem?  At end of Chapter 4, the book announces you already know every basic tool to write C++.  Say WHAT???  Uh, no, I do NOT.<br /><br />Then, Chapter 5, the book starts pummeling you with never before shown or seen function calls and terminology that's not explained at all.  Where did that code come from?  Did I miss something?  Um.. no.  I had indeed read meticulously every word up to that point.  But suddenly comes all this code that the author somehow must think that you know already???  I wondered if some vitals chapters were axed or moved around between editions?  You can still glean what the code samples mean by context, but, it's so reader unfriendly and a waste of time, to have code that you've never seen in all the prior chapters, I just couldn't fathom what the authors were thinking.<br /><br />Some sample code started not working due to proprietary header filer that didn't seem to work with my Xcode.  Why?  Shouldn't we learn from what's already available in the standard library?  Visit to Bjarne's website as recommended helped none.  For example, I'm guess sort() is something in the proprietary header file we're supposed to download off of his website?  Well, the header file he wants the reader to use didn't play nice with my Xcode.  So, instead, I did what the book recommended as a secondary alternative, to write in a list of #include's and using namespace, etc.  Nope; ""sort(vectorName)"" still no bueno.  I looked up on Google, to find, it's sort(vectorName.begin(), vectorName.end()) format for std:sort(), not the notation used in the book.  That was a good 15 minutes of my life pooofed/gone.  At least I'll never forget that syntax - Well, maybe not for a week.  And that was like the third or fourth time where the secondary method of putting the necessary includes and using's vs. proprietary header file method failed me.  Due to this I had to find my own methods to solve the practice problems, that I knew were not the intended lesson in the book.  That left me often thinking what did I REALLY learn from that chapter?  Are the few nuggets of wisdom every tenth page of this overwritten text worth it?<br /><br />I quit reading at chapter 5, which was the beginning of the debugging lessons, after reading maybe 30 pages of such common sense drivel in that chapter, my head hurt, then seeing huge number of code that were not covered previously in the book again, looked for another book.  I think I may return to it, after a few more novice books on the subject.  Computer Genius != Good Teacher.",2.0,0,2020

Wonderfully Emotional Book,"I have read all of Ms. Hilderbrand's books, and the favorites, by far, are those set on Nantucket.  Blue Bistro, The Perfect Couple, and now 28 Summers are at the top of my list.  28 Summers, aside from the story line, incorporates some techniques that I very much liked.  The ""off-stage"" narrator not only gives equal insight to characters but also asks the reader to join in the observations.  Jake and Mallory, the main characters, are referred to as ""our boy"" and ""our girl;"" that seems to include the reader. The book opens in 2020 and quickly goes back 28 years to when the story really began, a story that no one truly knows.  Each time frame begins with things that were on people's mind that year - political, pop culture, music, etc. - and each segment is written in the present tense.  I thought that a masterful decision. The story itself is the progression of the love story of Jake and Mallory that is fashioned after the film, Same Time Next Year. While such an arrangement may seem impossible, I can be a believer. Their characters and those in the periphery are so well drawn that I feel as though I know them all.  I didn't like them all but came to understand them. I was frustrated with Jake, annoyed with Leeland, appalled by Ursula, disturbed by Coop, and even mystified by Mallory, just as I might at times feel about those I know in reality.

"Interesting, Informative, Scholarly Book focused on lower class society with some political insight","The book entitled: “White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America” by Nancy Isenberg was an interesting and informative book.  Much of its focus was on the lower middle class or those near to the bottom rung of society.  There were extensive scholarly references.  Beyond the normal scholarship was a discussion of material like TV and movies related to the topic that captured the sense of class and how the media treated it; some readers will find this supportive of the author’s thesis but this reviewer found it a bit too tangential to the main thesis.  This reviewer found discussion about the southern whites and their poverty and their diet and how the slave labor eroded the opportunity for upward mobility quite insightful.<br />The author, Isenberg, points out: “Trump’s favorite slogan, “Make America Great Again,” was, of course, Ronald Reagan’s first.” And goes on to say: “The argument of this book is that America’s class history is a more complicated story than we’ve previously considered. The past informs the present.” Isenberg states: “One cannot effectively lump voters together into arbitrary blocs … And as White Trash has sought to make clear, the so-called white, working-class vote is an inaccurate designation as well. Class matters, as identity politics matters, but neither is sufficient alone to define categories of voting behavior. … Selective belief, preference for one “truth” over another, explains, for instance, how someone can dismiss the vast majority of scientists who see incontrovertible evidence of dangerous trends in climate change.”  She goes on to say: “Only 32.5 percent of Americans today graduate college, which means that the majority does not imagine this path up the social ladder as its ticket to success.<br />The election has opened up festering wounds. The deepest of these exposes how we measure the value of civic virtue and hard work. Many successful Americans believe they have made it on their own and have little patience for the complaints of those left behind. … Angry Trump voters were convinced that these classes (the “takers”) were not playing by the rules (i.e., working their way up the ladder) and that government entitlement programs were allowing some to advance past more deserving (white, native-born) Americans. This was how many came to feel “disinherited.” … By 2016, Trump’s “I will bring the jobs back” seemed a winning concept. Distrust of fluid class boundaries made many voters fear competition from below. They lacked faith in the promised social mobility of the meritocratic system.<br />In terms of history of immigrating from Europe and settlement in New England, the author states that: “For every religious dissenter in the exodus of the 1630s, there was one commercially driven emigrant from London or other areas of England. The majority in these years came as extended families accompanied by their servants. And almost 60 percent of the arrivals were under the age of twenty-four—one-third of them unattached males.  …. To attract settlers, he boasted that the amount of money required for purchasing a few measly acres in England translated into hundreds of acres in Massachusetts. …. Nevertheless, Winthrop had no plan for redeeming all the poor, whom he referred to as the “scum of the land.”  Isenberg states: “Slavery had been slow to take hold, with only around 150 slaves counted in 1640, and barely 1,000 out of a total population of 26,000 in 1670. … Massachusetts and English possessions in the Caribbean, not Virginia, were the first colonies to codify slave law. By the time of Bacon’s Rebellion, there were some 6,000 servants in the southern colony, and roughly one-third of all freeholders, many of them former indentured servants, were barely scraping by, weighed down by debts and unfair taxes.” This reader learned from the author that: “The rivalry between the dueling Carolinas was only part of the story. The original charter of Carolina would eventually be divided three ways, when Georgia was parceled out of the original territory in 1732. … In refusing to permit slavery, the Georgia colony promised that “free labor” would replace a reliance on indentured servants as well as African bondsmen.” Moreover, “But Georgia meant something more. Even as South Carolinians jealously eyed the new territory as a place where they might sell slaves and control the land, the colony of free laborers offered a ready boundary (and slave-free zone) that would protect the vulnerable planter class from Native tribes and Spanish settlers in Florida, who might otherwise offer a haven to their runaway slaves. Georgia, as we shall see, was a remarkable experiment.” Isenberg goes on to say, initially at least that: “Poor settlers coming from England, Scotland, and other parts of Europe were granted fifty acres of land, free of charge, plus a home and a garden. Distinct from its neighbors to the north, Georgia experimented with a social order that neither exploited the lower classes nor favored the rich.” The author goes on to explain: “According to Francis Moore, who visited the settlement in its second year of operation, two “peculiar” customs stood out: both alcohol and dark-skinned people were prohibited. “No slavery is allowed, nor negroes,” Moore wrote. As a sanctuary for “free white people,” Georgia “would not permit slaves, for slaves starve the poor laborer.”” In economic terms the situation had other drivers and Isenberg states: “After allowing South Carolina to send over slaves to fell trees and clear the land for the town of Savannah, Oglethorpe came to regret the decision. … William Byrd … saw how slavery had sparked discontent among poor whites in Virginia, who routinely refused to “dirty their hands with Labour of any kind,” preferring to steal or starve rather than work in the fields.”  Life in Georgia changed and as Isenberg states: “In 1750, settlers were formally granted the right to own slaves. … By 1788, Carolinian Jonathan Bryan was the most powerful man in Georgia, with thirty-two thousand acres and 250 slaves. … By 1760, only 5 percent of white Georgians owned even a single slave, while a handful of families possessed them in the hundreds. Jonathan Bryan was the perfect embodiment of the “Slave Merchants” who Oglethorpe had warned would dominate the colony.” The author writes that: “Franklin contended that the only solution to poverty was some kind of coercive system to make the indigent work: “I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.”<br />But with newfound liberty, their fate rested on the most impersonal of forces: survival of the fittest. The harsh environment of the frontier forced settlers either to work hard or perish. … In his Autobiography, he told a story of how he gave up vegetarianism as a young man after he saw the belly of a fish cut open and all the little fish fall out. This story was a class parable, the lesson being that the big fish (or powerful elites) devoured weaker men.”  The author also provides historical insight about Andrew Jackson stating: “In Jackson’s crude lexicon, territorial disputes were to be settled by violent means, not by words alone. He explained his Indian policy as the right of “retaliatory vengeance” against “inhumane bloody barbarians.” … Jackson’s thinking shaped his Indian removal policy as president. He argued that Indians should not be treated as sovereign nations with special claims on the public domain, but as a dependent class. Like squatters, if Indians failed to assimilate or proved incapable of improving the land and securing land titles, they could be forcibly removed.” Later the author examines eugenics as methods for dealing with white trash and states: “By 1931, twenty-seven states had sterilization laws on the books, along with an unwieldy thirty-four categories delineating the kinds of people who might be subject to the surgical procedure.” As Isenberg tries to tie this history together she states: “The Civil War was a struggle to shore up both a racial and a class hierarchy. The Confederacy was afraid that poor whites would be drawn in by Union appeals and would vote to end slavery—because slavery was principally a reflection of the wealthy planters’ self-interest. …Today as well we have a large unbalanced electorate that is regularly convinced to vote against its collective self-interest. These people are told that East Coast college professors brainwash the young and that Hollywood liberals make fun of them and have nothing in common with them and hate America and wish to impose an abhorrent,<br />godless lifestyle.” The author reflects on the one impact of slavery in the following observation of poor whites in the south, when she states: “The gap in education levels matched what had existed between the North and South before the Civil War. Many of the men who took the test had never used a pencil before. Southern white men exhibited stunted bodies—army medical examiners found them to be smaller, weaker, and less physically fit.<br />Beginning in 1909, the New York–based Rockefeller Institute poured massive amounts of money into a philanthropic program aimed at eliminating hookworm,<br />It didn’t help the South’s image that hookworm was spread by the lack of sanitation. Outhouses were rare among the southern poor, let alone toilets. 63<br />The stock of poor white men produced in the South were dismissed as unfit for military service, the women unfit to be mothers.  For many in the early twentieth century, then, the “new race problem” was not the “negro problem.” It was instead a different crisis, one caused by the “worthless class of anti-social whites.””  The author examines efforts by US presidents FDR and LBJ to attempt to improve the lot of the poor and explains how most successful presidential candidates strive to connect to all classes of voters. In summarizing the impact of class and where things are today, Isenberg states: “Upper-and middle-class parents instruct their children in surviving their particular class environment. They give them the appropriate material resources toward this end.<br />We have always relied—and still do—on bloodlines to maintain and pass on a class advantage to our children. Statistical measurement has shown convincingly that the best predictor of success is the class status of one’s forebears.  On average, Americans pass on 50 percent of their wealth to their children; in Nordic countries, social mobility is much higher; parents in Denmark give 15 percent of their total wealth to their children, and in Sweden parents give 27 percent. Class wealth and privileges are a more important inheritance (as a measure of potential) than actual genetic traits.” And as if particularly mindful of the Covid-19 pandemic she states: “It was only in the midst of the Great Depression that the country fully appreciated the meaning of downward mobility. At that time, when a quarter of the nation was thrown out of work, the old standby of blaming the individual no longer convinced anyone.”",4.0,1,2020
Really?  People actually live like this?,"I know that this is fiction. I know that it is fantasy - check out the dialogue, that alone will make you wonder.  But, really, I don't care about the kind of money you have - white trash can have money - but these guys in the tattoo parlor need to find some class.  Wait. No, they need to find a lot of class.  Yes, you can talk about sex all the live long day. And believe me, I don't mind, but you know what?  It isn't classy. Period.<br /><br />Then after they find some class, Chelle Bliss needs to find an editor and then maybe another story line that includes a real live plot and some interesting dialogue that doesn't center on their gonads.  Lord, I'm nowhere NEAR a prude, but give me sex with a plot and some action, and some dialogue, and some DEPTH.  Characters with depth are always nice to round out a book.  Frankly, this needs a re-write. Oh, and lose the cliffhanger with no warning.  Easiest way in the world to get someone to drop an author is to write a cliffhanger and warn no one.

Victory and Real Breakthroughs,"Daniel C Okpara writes some really high-quality books that have helped me immensely lately, especially with one serious battle in which I needed God's protection. I prayed a prayer out loud at the end of Daniel C Okpara's Psalm 91 book and the results were life changing.<br /><br />Now in this book on prayer many issues are presented:<br /><br />Should we listen more than we talk?<br />Why do dreams have deeper meanings?<br />Can God talk to us during prayer times?<br />How can I win spiritual battles and be victorious?<br /><br />Daniel C Okpara seems to be an expert on prayer and he is filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. He knows what words are effective as he is inspired by God's words to write down what is true.<br /><br />In this excellent book you will learn what the author came to realize after much personal experience. He found that by praying for others he himself was healed. Obviously God had big plans for his life and ministry.<br /><br />There is a lot of good advice here to help you figure out how to hear from God. Some of the information is about what dreams might be saying to you, especially recurring dreams. I look forward to reading more books by this author as he really speaks the truth.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",5.0,1,2020

You Need This Book!,"This isn't a fun read.  It's not a beach book, and you may be happier if you're not reading it while far away from home and family and unable to do much to protect them at the moment, or if you've had lots of caffeine.  It's anxiety-inducing, as it should be.  There's account after account of terrible incidents, unthinkable violence and depravity committed on innocent and unsuspecting victims, and the sometimes completely unsatisfying outcomes after ""justice"" has supposedly been served.  There are plenty of concrete suggestions about how to avoid becoming prey, including the very sensible idea that walking from the far corner of the parking lot to increase your physical fitness, as we've all been advised to do, is dangerously foolhardy.  Nancy Grace has helpful tips regarding both security equipment and security practices, and she's speaking from both personal experience and intensive research into the subject.  Some of this stuff is miserably difficult to think about.  If you're someone who tends to ignore or sidestep thinking about safety, you're setting yourself up for disaster.

A little cheesy,"I have read a ton of Indian romance books and was disappointed in this one. The book didn't flow well and there were a few mistakes. The author states that she did research and took a course. What she should have done is to read Indian romance books by long time authors who has been writing a long time on the same subject. I think it would help her to see what she could have done to make the book a lot better. The ending was cut too short, almost as if the author was in a hurry to finish the book quickly.

"3 stars because i read all 9 books; however, more like 2.5 stars","I almost stopped reading after the first chapter or two.  I kept going because my mom said it was good.  She stopped reading at book 4, but I completed all 9 books.<br />The number of clichés and description/dialogue almost made me stop.  but i kept going and started to like characters.  then it all fell apart.  I wanted the series over.  too much fight, rest a few minutes, fight again.  Lack of communication between characters (lots of secrets) and between staff and students.  What was worse was the lack of communication with riders and their dragons.  I read a lot of dragon books - and there is usually mind talk going on.  This skims over how a rider/dragon communicate.<br />I could never pronounce any character names/or the city for that matter.  Why have names we can't even say?<br />I hate love triangles - and this one was weak and the main character had no idea what was going on OR who she even cared for. She came across as lame/weak.<br />Hated what happened to one male character.  He did so much good and then suddenly everything falls apart for him.<br />at times, I didn't know what was happening or who was speaking.  In one scene, there were 3 witches. the author said something like, ""The witch said..."" and I didn't know which witch and didn't care to go back a page to figure it out.<br />the epilog was very unsatisfying.  So many important characters completely left out. The end was abrupt and didn't make sense - although i know what author was going for, sort of.<br />This author has potential. Even though I was annoyed often with the characters and what was going on, I still continued to the end.  I don't know however, if I'll read anything else. I need stories with love and friendship and communication - not just sarcasm, secrets, and ""we'll talk later"". Continuous battles never work for me.<br />Because the author has potential, and because I finished the series, I am giving this 3 stars.",3.0,0,2020
Self-aggrandizing regurgitation of what we already knew from the tabloids,"Do I really need to say more than the headline? It's hard to believe that she wrote all of this, and if she did, there is really no substance here, which is shocking to me. There were some interesting facts about decisions she made, and you can kind of see in hindsight where her life was going as she made certain decisions. But there wasn't enough about her relationship with her dad, and what she does say about it doesn't give anyone any real picture of what was there. A lot of covering over transgressions, and feigning forgiveness for things she doesn't really mention. I wish there was more about her relationship with Nick, but the way she writes their ""love story"" it was as if it was doomed from the start (and in the fact that he never had her families support certainly makes this true!). But it's as if she never really wished she married him - her rising career that just made him jealous? I suppose it's plausible- I'd read his biography to compare for sure!  The book doesn't really feel deep or meaningful and I'm so saddened by that - I actually expected more. One thing is for sure I feel deeply for those who don't know the truth about what happens when a person dies. As you can see from her own story, the lies her church has told her have chained her to a deep sadness she can't seem to move on from. It's one thing to grieve and it's another to never move on- she doesn't seem to celebrate Sarah's life, but more be held down by her memory. It's a recurring thought throughout the book. But perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole book, is her blanket forgiveness of all without any details like one might expect from a ""Open Book"" biography. I already knew her story from following her in the tabloids since I was a teen - I really learned nothing new or of any significance.",3.0,0,2020
I love this awesome series and Jack is one of my favorite ghost characters!,"I love this series even more now that I've read the second book. Charlene's relationship with Jack, the resident ghost in her B&B was so sweet but sad since they could never be together like a regular couple. She had to be content with him giving her sage advice about murders she always seemed to fall into finding. Jack was terribly jealous though of the cute detective, Sam Holden who clearly liked Charlene, and the feeling there was mutual.<br /><br />I had a feeling at one point who the killer was after a carefully placed clue. But there were a lot of great red herrings along the way and interesting characters. Charlene ended up in the hospital because of one of them. Then at the showdown, Jack did something to save her life, as much as a ghost who can't leave the property can do, that is.

Fan of E.O.'s,"Can't believe this book was written in 1997 and I only got around to reading it in 2020.  Shame on me.  However, I found it as relevant today as it must have been in 1997.  Then however, many nay sayers might have rejected the book.  Hard to imagine anyone would dismiss his insight today.  Consilience, the marriage of social science and natural science seems to be a happening.  Did E.O. jump start the idea?  Likely not, but surely many must have read the book and saw the need for the marriage.  He pens an interesting argument between a religionist and an Empiricist (which he as ... all this while I thought he was a plain vanilla atheist but not so).  I recommend you read it and weep.  Oh, one of his observations back in 1997 was that the Conservative party was leaning too far into the Libertarian agenda ... WOW!  I did not recognize that until sometime around 2012 (hey I'm a conservative but likely not for long).  Now on to Bob Woodward's Rage.",5.0,1,2020
"Not what I expected, given the beast on the cover.","""Clever series"", says my brother-in-law. ""Sorry"", says I. ""I don't do books with thinking animals that somehow solve crimes through deductions not apparent to humans"". My wife and sister may be into the cute animal mysteries but I will pass thankyouverymuch!<br /><br />Well, I decided to give it a shot in a weak moment and was glad I did. The plot moves quickly, is quite clever and kept me guessing. The role of the dog prominently displayed on the cover? To do what dogs are supposed to do - hang around, enjoy doggie loves, go for walks with the owner and plop on the couch for a good part of the day.<br /><br />So basically, the dog is more prop than participant and that is fine with me. He's there because Andy Carpenter is a dog lover and the dog is part of his daily life. Andy is a smart mouth attorney, always ready with the clever quip and the insightful observation. Evidently a lot of books in this series so if I need another dose of Andy, there is no shortage of opportunities.",4.0,1,2020

I gotta say that I finished this book,But I didn't really like it at all.  I guess I felt that it was trying too hard to be a romantic thriller that it feel short for me.  I didn't really connect with characters because most of their actions seemed to incomprehensible to me.  Colt and Justin were supposed to be alpha males; but seemed to be only cartoon versions.

Yet another book that is formatted terribly and not proof read at all,"No one read this before it was published, just like the last one. Ugland needs to slow down and actually write these properly.<br /><br />You've got ""chapters"" here that are half a page long. You've got scenes separated by artistic little page breaks only there are 4 page breaks per page. Every chapter starts with the first letter of the first word being 10x the size of all the other letters, only because of formatting problems it's overlaid on top of the words right under it so you can't read them. Just a giant black A or something that covers all of the first 2 words on the second line, at the start of every chapter. It's ridiculous and makes the book difficult to work through.<br /><br />Then of course you have sentences that are missing words, words that are jumbled, like ""ubt"" instead of ""but,"" and all kinds of agreement errors. Then more serious errors, like people who Clyde meets will already know his name somehow, because Ugland forgot to put in the scene where he introduces himself. It's all very distracting and makes the book harder to read.<br /><br />The last book ended with a tiny bit of set up for this one, only Ugland immediately got tired of the set up I guess because he totally changed it with in the first 10 pages of this one. Once again you get a character appear here for absolutely no reason at all, they do nothing, and then they say ""well see you in the next installment of 'The Good Guys!' and exit stage left. It's a horrible way to tie the two series together and he won't stop doing it.<br /><br /> Then, even worse, just like the last book Ugland thinks it's so cute to have scenes from American movies play out in the book as some kind of hat tip to the reader. A creature that looks like a wookie does something Chewbacca did in Star Wars everybody! I saw that movie so I recognized it! Something that happens in the Princess Bride happens in this book too! I saw that movie! So cool! It's not quite as bad as it was in the last book but 1) It's completely immersion breaking and only serves to remind you that the author is breaking the 4th wall to wink at you, and 2) it's not funny or entertaining in any way. It's exactly like your Dad telling you a bedtime story and he can't remember the evil queen's name so he calls her Hillary Clinton or something. It's just eye-rollingly stupid.<br /><br />Finally, the other problem is that the hero is still an absent minded moron. You literally have a character say ""You really need to do ____"" and the hero just forgets all about it, never does it. The hero robs someone and gets a huge bag of money, then loses it all. This savvy criminal anti-hero we got here frequently gets scammed by tricks that wouldn't fool a child. It's just incredibly badly written in the sense that on the one hand we're supposed to believe that this guy is an amazing savant who literally goes the entire book fighting monsters and is never touched by one. Literally. No wounds at all in the whole book. Then, on the other hand, he's too stupid to keep from putting his feet in the water while sharks are circling the boat. It's so inconsistent and hard to believe that it takes you out of the story, again.<br /><br />I just get the feeling he is cranking these out in a hurry and I wish he would slow down some because it would really really help the quality of what he's turning out. I don't feel like the last book was worth the money and I don't think this one is either and tbh if I hadn't already paid for the next book in The Good Guys I wouldn't be buying that one either. No one wants to read first drafts that we waited 10 months for. Ugland needs to get it together and actually put 2 weeks of work into the next one.",3.0,0,2020

Satisfying continuation but need more!,My only gripe with this book is the short time span it covers. Yet it covers it very nicely and brings more depth and development to the characters. I like that Fay is going to get a decent growth from this book forward and Kari feels more aggressive within this book. You can see how Kari will be a solid foundation and the leader of the harem that is growing around Eryk.<br /><br />A lot of time is spent on the Tournament and the individual characters involved. Even one of Eryk's opponents falls in love with him while fighting and losing to him. Possible harem member number four! The flash back dreams are a bit less since this is a much shorter time span but they give decent insight to some of what haunts him. Also Lin gets to show more of her affection for Eryk in a few scenes that allows her to bond with him more. I do especially like the fact that after this book she will not be trapped inside the home all the time now.<br /><br />Anyways the story was good and the character development shined through in this one. The fights were entertaining and fun. Eryk's weapon is a good iteration of the Chain Whip Sword. Him using his lightning element to control it instead of links of cable or chains was a great idea. I look forward to seeing what the custom weapon for Fay will turn out to be.<br /><br />I am looking forward to how this all continues and how Fay reacts to Kari's solution to their problem!,5.0,1,2020
DNF,"Wow, this girl is so obnoxious that I couldn’t finish, let alone root for her in any way. If this was written from another student’s POV, Tamsin would be the mean girl that everyone hates. Plus, it’s written in first person but that doesn’t mean you have a clear understanding of what’s going through her head. For example, she can read minds and will respond to what she’s hearing, but we’re not able to hear them so you have to figure out what’s going on through context.

Great read!,"This book starts at the exact end of the last book, still roiling with action, danger, and the need for survival. The layout for advancement and the author keeping up with previous abilities shines through. I only wished that he had given a breakdown at the beginning, a list of skills, abilities and stats. But, the whole thing quickly comes around and is easily figured out.<br /><br />The book starts with Richter at the bottom of a cave, deep under ground. No weapons, no armor. He has to survive a 7 day curse with nothing but a few enchanted baubles. Being stranded alone with no supplies at all. This book spans a few days while he's underground. Using every niche of all his skills, he tries to survive. Very good read. I can't wait for the next in the series!",5.0,1,2020

"There was nothing that I want to ""recommend""","i've read a good deal of Logan Jacob's work.  I usually like the first 1-2 books in a series, but slowly become less and less interested due to what feels like a lack of character development and a plotless drift in the tales.  They just don't anchor to any one thing and the amorphous feel of the plot really gets to me.<br /><br />I really did enjoy Monster Girl base #1.  It had a nice hook and while the cast was very small, the characters played off each other well in the few worlds they got to visit.  I was looking forward to this book.<br /><br />I will NOT get book 3.  Book 2 ended up feeling like a cash grab tale.  The cast not only did not change, but the worlds they went to felt artificial in a strange way.  it was as if Logan had no idea what he was doing, but he wanted to pad the pages, so he has our heroes wandering far from their base in worlds that had no humans.  This even led to another mad dash to get back in time because even though they KNEW that the base would move in the morning, they spent the night because ""I want to sleep in a bed.""  I HATE that level of uncommon dunce.  If I know I absolutely positively have to be at location A at 0500 hours.  I'm not going to lay my head down at location B at 2200 hours thinking I'm going to wake in time.  I'm going to march back to location A and go to sleep there.  But there were ""reasons"".<br /><br />And the less said about the universes themselves the better.  I remember Sliders had some interesting universes that did not have humans, but the better ones were always the ones with humans from an alternate timeline, like Emma in book 1 (where Tesla somehow created a permanent electrical storm and turned machines into Screamers [look up the movie])  This world had 0 new humans to interact with.  Not one.<br /><br />It just ended up feeling like a lot of empty story that did not develop the characters or move the tale.  At the end of book 2, there wasn't any payoff for the trip.  at least not one for the slog.<br /><br />And as for the sex scenes, there were too many and they were a bit overdone.  I don't mind an occasional roll in the hay for good characters, but the ones here were too often, and just played out like a adolescent virgin's fantasies.  Especially since these women would stop work on shelters to demand that they get it good and hard.<br /><br />It just didn't feel like enough thought went into this for me to recommend it.  It's not bad, so I don't feel right giving it less than 3 stars, but it is definitely not more than that, so.... YMMV if you like harem tales that are more silly than serious, but this one was definitely disappointing to me.",3.0,0,2020
3-1/2 Stars for the first in a series,"Because I was anxious to read this author, and since the series sounded like something I might enjoy, I ended up with this book as well as the following two.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed in the way the story was laid out, and the sentences that were a little wacky and mixed up. The story I could deal with, despite the fact that mention is made of things with no basis. I'm now assuming that Evie Bishop has been in some other book written by Reus and that's why there are references that didn't connect while I was reading.  And as for the sentences,  Ellis has come back to his house, Dylan yells up the stairs for Evie to come down. She does and the line is ""she froze for all of a second when she saw who was standing with her brother in the living room.""  OK, except that she would have only frozen if she'd seen who was standing with Dylan.  I found 3-4 instances like this in the book, and am I being overly critical?  Nope, I'm not. If you publish a book for me to read, I expect it to be as good as you can make it. If a book is well edited and well written, those sentences find their way out of it before its published.  And just for clarification, I compare romance, regardless of the type, to the best writers of the genre, and I set the bar high. Publishing a book isn't good enough, it has to be good because I read every word in a book, and those words are painting the picture for me as I read. It doesn't take much to throw that off.<br /><br />Overall the story was good, but not great. There was a lot of over the top talk of the government agencies with the three letters, etc., but that kind of reference isn't needed unless you are writing to someone who has never heard of any of them. I'll move on to Book #2 in this series and hope it engages me more than this one did.",3.0,0,2020

I couldnt put it down. The feels this novel provoked stayed with me for hours after I finished, not just the moments I'm yelling at the characters, the moments I'm crying, or smiling, but it left me thinking long after.

I Give This Book 6 Stars!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Darlene Tallman knows how to write an MC Series that has family as a backbone. We saw it with her series co-authored with Liberty Parker, Rebels Guardians MC & Rebels Guardians Next Generation. She went a little gritty with The Nelson Brothers' & The Black Tuxedos MC and we all LOVED it! Now with the series Poseidon's Warriors MC, she went solo as she went back to her roots and she hit it straight out of the park! In Australia she has even earned herself a well deserved orange ribbon for making #1 with the 1st book in the series, Poseidon's Lady!<br /><br />Lilli is on on the run for her life when she finds Poseidon at his cabin during a snowstorm. Poseidon was looking for a little peace and quiet for a few days, something he needs from time to time being the President of an MC. When these two meet, with Lilli literally falling at Poseidon's feet, the chemistry between the two is felt immediately.<br /><br />Even though I would say this is a quick to love book, at the same time it's not. You get to enjoy the build up, watching them get to know each other and watching the chemistry between the two heat up before it explodes into a white hot heat between two people who cannot wait a moment longer before they finally give in to their shared desires.<br /><br />I said it before to start this review and I want to end it reiterating my point. We know and love Darlene Tallman for her MC Romance books, but Poseidon's Lady took her writing to another level. And with the little teasers that she has posted on her Facebook page I see each of the books in this series just getting better and better, if that's even possible! I can see it now Book #1 - 6 stars, Book #2  - 7 stars, Book #3 - 8 stars... if they would only let us give more than 5 stars! This series is going to be epic!

A must read,"This is an intense, dramatic, shocking and sweet story. When Adrian was 8 he was burned in the fire that killed his father. He was left scarred and at the mercy of his cold-hearted mother, then his evil stepfather. When he was 10 his twin and oldest brothers found out what he had been through, and they decided that someone needed to do something about the abuse  and came up with the idea of a masked crusader named Prometheus. Soon after that their stepfather was dead. Adrian became the masked man as an adult when he found out what his stepbrother was doing with children at his bawdy houses. Adrian spirited children from places like that and brought them to the orphanage that he started. He normally hid from society, but he went to the theater once and became entranced with Vanessa, the lead heroine. Vanessa knew that Adrian was an admirer and hoped that he would introduce himself, but he never did. She heard what people said about him, but didn't care about his scars. One night Adrian gets shot and almost caught, but he went to Vanessa's flat and escaped. He had a boy of about 6 with him and asked Vanessa to bring him to the orphanage. Vanessa fell in love with Gabriel and visited often. Vanessa was visited by Prometheus a few times, and she felt drawn to him as well. Unfortunately for Adrian, people began to figure out who he was, and not all of them were happy about it. The storyline is so suspenseful and intense, and Adrian and Vanessa are so sweet.

"Good for HSers, but not much higher.",To be fair to the author I have a PhD in American political science so I might not be the best judge of this text. I made it through 40 pages and then I realized it was a waste of my time. The author is a law school teacher and that clearly shows throughout the writing and the reductionist view of actions. Could have benefited from a political scientist's viewpoint and an understanding of political psychology. Very rational choice with little understanding of norms.

Needs Edited,"I read this book via kindle unlimited and I was very intrigued by the action/adventure plot.  In author Stone’s synopsis, she warned readers that this book might not be everyone’s cup of tea.  The book includes forced sex, dominance and abduction, unfortunately what the book doesn’t include is a proof reader!  The tale that is weaved is about government conspiracy, treachery and aliens. It’s got a hunger games feel about the team of an alien and a human, having to survive an alien ‘game’. Which was an intriguing plot. The characters had complex backstories which I also liked. I mentally eliminated the sex and sexual references, which resulted in the book having a solid action/adventure plot.  Which despite the author’s warning means the book isn’t all about sex. Unfortunately for the author whoever edited it did a very poor job. It’s as if they only used a spell check and grammar program.  The editor missed redundancies, wrong wording usage, misplaced words and correct punctuation, along with continuity errors.  Any author is only as good as their team of editors and unfortunately author Stone was let down by her team.  Someone should have pointed out the errors to the author so that she could have brought to the reading public a tighter story and a cleanly edited book.",2.0,0,2020
Author opened with plot giveaway,"This is my first DNF of 2020 and the first ever book by this author I didn’t like. I think had the author not started the book giving everything away to anyone who can sort out a plot quickly, I may have had a better reading experience. Two big time jumps as if to say, I don’t have a lot invested in these characters and their build up fell very short-so let’s move ahead. I’m happy others enjoyed it as she’s a great writer. This was just had too much drag, gave away the plot and zero character investment with the very annoying relationship between “Graham cracker“ and the protagonist. Felt rushed. If you’re a KU reader like myself. You only lost time. I think there was supposed to be some humor but that to fell short. Jack and Jill. Fantastic characters and great humor. If you have not read that, I highly suggest it.",3.0,0,2020

AN EXTRAORDINARY TALE!!!,"OMG 😱 OMG 😱 OMG 😱!!!<br />This book! This book got better and better the more I read!! At first I liked it. Then, I really liked it. Having JUST finished it, I loved it!<br /><br />So....a story about wanting to be more than you are and realizing that what you are is extraordinary.<br /><br />Here ya go:<br /><br />YA - What a kiss!<br />AU - Comic heroes do exist!<br />Urban Fantasy - Can I have a super-power, too?<br /><br />Nick Bell is our MC. He’s neurodiverse with severe ADHD. He is in high school. He writes fanfic about his  real-life crush, Shadow Star, and the hero’s arch nemesis, Pyro Storm.<br /><br />Nick is absolutely hilarious! His brain goes 100 miles a minute and gets distracted by every bit of shine and sparkle that crosses his path. He has an amazing imagination and is obsessed with the Extraordinaries which live among mere mortals.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this story was Nick’s close group of friends. We have the adorable bow-tie-wearing Seth, the baby butch Gibby, and the cheerleader Jazz. These four were all so very different but worked so well together!!<br /><br />Another strong plus of the story was the focus on the father-son relationship between Nick and his dad. Often, in YA books, parents are tertiary characters at best. Not so here, my friends! Officer Aaron Bell is a strong secondary character that drives the plot forward (and possibly the plot of the next book???).<br /><br />Let’s talk about love...yessssssss!!! There is love. There is pinning. There is, “How the hell can you be so blind, Nicky?!” But it all works out in the end for Nick and his man!! ❤️❤️❤️<br /><br />Will you like it? I truly hope so.<br /><br />My rec? It’s extraordinary! 👏👏👏<br /><br />***I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.***",5.0,1,2020
too many tropes,"teenage/young adult girl with special gifts-check<br />tragic backstory-check<br />girl suddenly discovers she’s extraordinary-check<br />evil organization doing evil because they’re evil (got it?)-check<br />girl in terrible danger from evil org-check.<br />Same old same old, yawn.<br /><br />The book is decently written, and Mackenzie’s music therapy career choice is unusual and a nice touch, but I’ve read this plot too many times already. I get that being special is something almost every teenager wants. The thing is, only a few people are special; the rest of us make do with ordinary and just have to work harder.<br /><br />Then, too, special can be boring. Wouldn’t it be more interesting if heroines and heroes found ways to do great things using ordinary qualities and average gifts? Yes, I get that’s a harder story to write, but we all seem stuck in this one fantasy and I want out . . .<br /><br />It would also be nice if YA books branched out from the ubiquitous covers with a beautiful young woman swanning about in a long gown. The main character in this book, Mackenzie, doesn’t even own a gown and she has no reason to buy one in the book (cause where would she wear it? the beach? hanging around on campus? grocery shopping, perhaps?). It makes her seem like she’s a girl who just wants to look beautiful and impress people, and that’s fairly far down on her list of things to do. Mackenzie is neither vain or nor focussed on appearance.<br /><br />The covers both misrepresent her character and communicate that hoary old patronizing message to women: looks are the most important thing in life, because you’re not going to get a man if you aren’t attractive, honey. Haven’t women been beaten up enough with that stick? Maybe it’s time to stop passing that message along? Anyway, enough of this rant! The poor book doesn’t deserve this much opprobrium, and it isn’t the text’s fault that cover got stuck on it . . . I think publishers assume YA readers will choose books with covers that have pretty girls in pretty dresses, cause the readers like to imagine themselves that way. Believe me, a reader’s imagination is far less tame!",3.0,0,2020

"Dull, plodding, utterly predictable, and totally ridiculous","Ugh. What a waste of time. The story plodded through an utterly ridiculous plot, somehow managing to combine dramatic events with a dull narration, while being really predictable at almost every turn. The villains were super-clever and always a few steps ahead, but at the end several well-armed bad guys were easily overcome by their unarmed captives through a series of miracles and blunders.

"Book 2 is inexcusably awful, but worth skipping to get to better books","While the first book was decent, if a tad overbearing in the teenage boy's fantasy come to life tropes, the second was downright unreadable! A spec ops colonel who reminisces about his typing class, before writing up a blistering AAR? I'm guessing the author doesn't actually know too many people who have served their country, much less those who went the extra 50 miles to become spec ops. I really did skip most of book 2, and never regretted that decision. It was as bad as a sequel as Grease 2! The rest were decent pulp fiction, and the military blunders became fewer, the further you read. The stories are well-paced, with few sections that lag with an excess of inconsequential detail, beyond a merchandising campaign that rivals Spaceballs for ridiculousness.",4.0,1,2020

clean romance,"This could definitely fit as a Hallmark movie in terms of girl dating Mr. Wrong when Mr. Right returns for their second chance romance. But I really liked Mr. Wrong and did not like Mr. Right at all for most of the book. Until over 3/4's of the way through I felt like Mr. Right (Tag) was conceited, manipulative and selfish. It wasn't until near the end and I saw him lose the selfishness that I thought he might be okay. I still have my doubts about their relationship since she really doesn't want a life on the road and that is what he had to offer and she couldn't ask him to give his career up. Really it was as wrong to ask him to give it up as for him to ask her to go with him. The way the author has written the book, it is a very happy ending but in real life I doubt it would actually last. So my dislike for the Hero was the reason for my two star rating. I did like the epilogue giving the down the road of time view which maybe gives a reader more hope for them.<br /><br />I've read other books by this author and liked them much better. For that reason I will try the next book in this series.<br /><br />No sex, language or violence",2.0,0,2020
Step-by-step guide to eating the healthy Mediterranean Diet,"This is a wonderful introduction to the healthy Mediterranean diet lifestyle.  It explains the philosophy and health benefits of this diet.  However, this book takes it further by giving you 6 weeks of meal prep recipes and guidelines.  So cook one day and have meals ready for the week that are healthy.  There are also almost 100 extra recipes that can be interchanged with those in the prep section.<br /><br />One of the best parts to me is that this cookbook includes nutritional stats for each recipe as well as shopping lists and equipment needs (all things you basically already own).<br /><br />I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher but it in no way influenced my review.",5.0,1,2020
More technical and dry than what I was hoping for,This was written by an anthropologist and it reads like it was written for other anthropologists. That's fine but it isn't what I was looking for. I was hoping for something lighter and more on the amusing side. This has a lot of examples of cultural misunderstandings grouped by theme. It does explain the underlying cultural assumptions behind the misunderstandings so I think it gives a much deeper analysis of WHY the problems are happening. It is probably very useful but I found it to be pretty dry reading.,3.0,0,2020

Fictional Mystery Meets True Mystery,"It is not often that a novel of crime fiction is grounded in an actual mysterious event; this one is.  The sinking of a ferry in the Baltic Sea, The Estonia, is central to all of the action in this latest book featuring Anita Sundstrom.  This maritime disaster caused the deaths of more people than any in peacetime.  In 1994, crossing from Estonia to Sweden, it sunk, killing over 800 passengers and crew.  There is still, after 25 years, no clear answer as to how or why this occurred.  The fictional present day mystery in Mourning in Malmo is complex. One man attempts to kill his wife, then dies himself; one man is bludgeoned to death, another has an ""accident,"" others have disappeared, and are they connected in any way?  It is up to Anita's team to sort out conflicting evidence, uncooperative people, all the time withstanding the offensive Zetterberg, temporarily heading the division in Moberg's absence.  Zetterberg is delightfully hateful!  Woven into this tale is some history of Estonia, a country of which I knew very little.  It is a pleasure to read a book for entertainment and to end up being informed as well.  As to an ending, this one is perfect.",5.0,1,2020

Another great Morton Farrier Two-Fer!,"The Morton Farrier books are arranged in such away that if genealogical research isn't your cup of tea, skip those chapters (but thereby missing updates on Morton's personal life) and still get a gripping, intensely-researched historical mystery novel. Conversely, if you're only interested in learning new research methods and places to look for records pertaining to your English ancestors and how to obtain them, skip the back story of whatever ancestral secrets Morton's latest client has hired him to unlock.<br /><br />Long-time fans will be relieved to learn ""Sterling"" is possibly the first book in which Morton *isn't* physically attacked or his car trashed by a client's disgruntled relative or associate who prefers the secrets remain buried. Nor does the House With Two Doors suffer any damage from same, and no member of Morton's immediate family is attacked or kidnapped. All of that happens in the back story of the ancestor Morton has been hired to unearth.<br /><br />That said, Morton and Juliette have settled into their fourth year of marital bliss. Daughter Grace is now a talkative and inquisitive two and a half year old. Juliette is still at Rye PD but temporarily on desk duty (which she hates) bc the three Farriers at Two Doors will soon become four, but we'll have to wait for the next book to find out if Grace gets a brother or a sister.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of (mostly) domestic tranquility, Morton has been notified of a disturbing DNA match in (of all places) Reno, Nevada USA, as well three new half-aunts, half-sisters to his birth mother ""Auntie"", who'll remain unaware of their existence until a future book.<br /><br />Morton still covers the one blank wall in his study with research notes, documents and photos from his current case, but now ""builds out"" family trees of DNA matches on rolls of oversize paper (butcher? newsprint? back side of leftover Christmas gift wrap?) which in one scene Morton draws family trees at one end while little Grace draws ""families of trees"" at the other.<br /><br />Once again, well done, NDG!",5.0,1,2020

Things seem to go from bad to worse with one misunderstanding after another, after another, after another... It got to the point where every chapter was more heartbreaking than the one before.<br /><br />And it may be God-like to turn the other cheek when it came to Tyler but at some point that man needed to have a come to Jesus moment. How he could be permitted to DJ at Tony's wedding after his horrific treatment of Marcy is beyond me. He should have been dealt with in some fashion.<br /><br />And how in the world can Colt be living with the kind of back pain that is constantly an issue throughout this book yet he seems perfectly fine to work out in his basement lifting all kinds of weights, etc.<br /><br />I received an ARC and voluntarily offer this review.",2.0,0,2020

Its okay,"I will be brutally honest here, the political correctness in this novel is so thick it became a constant distraction. In this alternate history, written during George W. Bush's first term as President, things worked out very differently. The book is set with an American lead international task force that gets dropped from the 2020's into 1942. My main issue with the novel other than the distracting level of political correct sermonising is the projected technology of the future group. These future people who are almost our contemporaries today have a level of technology that puts the real 2020 to shame. Not only do they have fusion reactors as the power source of their supercarrier and other large warships, they have integrated AI and medical implants that nobody n real 2020 has or would trust. The scenario appears to be that Hillary Clinton was elected President in 2004 and at some point after proving to be a kick butt leader in the war on terror she was assassinated by Jihadi believers.  The war on terror has been going on for 20 years and the western democracies including USA/UK/Australia have invested enormous sums on developing super advanced weapons.<br /><br />The transposed crew people are all bright capable politically correct wunderkind who are disgusted by the vert racism and sexism of the 1942 world. I actually found this aspect the most believable premise of the novel.  Culture in 1942 was as different from today as 1942 was to 1859.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, with the capabilities projected for the international task force just the scientific knowledge from one computer search would allow the 1942 allies to deploy 1950 level nuclear weapons inside six months without all the mistakes made OTL that wasted a great deal of effort.  Compared to 2020 the Mk 6 fat man bomb design is very primitive, but  it would give the allies an unstoppable advantage and could be mass produced with 1942 technology and historical plans.  That would end the war within 12 months of the future task force arrival even if nothing but that knowledge was transferred. With the ships and weapons available that timeline shrinks to a few weeks.<br /><br />IOW this could have been a stand alone novel detailing how the future won the war in weeks followed by the story of how future people tried to integrate into 1942 culture.  Instead everything is drawn out to create a multi volume series which will now be left unread by myself. The characters are just not that engaging, the PC lecturing is too over the top and the technological predictions too unrealistic to get me to purchase additional volumes of this series.",3.0,0,2020

Surprisingly fresh,"The LitRPG genre seems to have a lot of bad MCs and plots that delve into sex far too often.  This series avoided that from the start with an MC who cares for others and while he's a bit of an angsty mess at times, its believable and never overwhelms the other aspects of his character.  Add in the fact that he hasn't had to ""die"" to have his personality uploaded into some magical/computer world and the foundation for this was miles ahead of most in the genre.<br /><br />But then Dave found a new plot path.  And while there are a few plot holes in my opinion, the main plot just works.<br /><br />So we have a world that I'm actually interested in, characters I like, and only a minimal part of things I dislike.  If anything my one complaint is the number of redshirts this story seems to have in it.  It is no uncommon for characters to appear in one chapter only to become statistics a few chapters later.  This tale has a pretty high death count.  its realistic, but almost a bit of an emotional whiplash (for the characters too though, which shows that Dave is thinking about what he's writing.)<br /><br />This is one of the better tales I've read so far in 2020.",4.0,1,2020
"Interesting job for a cozy main character, driving a limo--and she's from Texas","A well-written and plotted mystery set in Dublin, Ireland with a Texan limo driver made for a really interesting and intriguing read. I fell in love with the little Jack Russell who had two puppies. Meg was babysitting them, and as she kept telling them that she wasn't keeping them but was growing closer and closer to the little dog family, I was hoping she'd weaken. I sure didn't like her boss much. That lady needs an attitude adjustment lol. Meg's friends were fun, but she was more of a loner while investigating the murder of her limo client's wife. She was ex-military, so it wasn't like she was unaware of danger and couldn't handle herself. A couple of friends and her uncle did some consulting for her. Uncle Rabbie was quite the character!<br /><br />Meg proved herself during the showdown with the killer, and it was awesome!

They didn't know how to talk to each other, there was jealousy and pettiness.  They divorced.  They are reunited 17 years later.  They still have anger and resentment but still have lust.  I didn't like how they treated each other but fell back into lust.  The twists and turns were so very predictable.  All the police stuff just really dragged the book out way too much.  So many secondary characters it was hard to keep up with everything.  Less would definitely have been better.  I never really felt a connection between them and because of that I lost interest and began skimming.  I was unhappy with the way they interacted.

Cliffhanger at End of the Book. But a Fun Read,"I thought it was a fun read. The book certainly will try to draw you into the next book, and since there are so many of them, it will be a long read. This book was relatively short. It is a classic fantasy, with such a mix of creatures that I quickly just started picturing them all as humans (who ever heard of a good Orc or an Ogre bouncer in a tavern?).<br /><br />But if you're just looking to waste time, then the book is well written enough that you'll fly through the pages. The plot is intriguing and there is plenty of mystery surrounding the two main characters, both of whom are 15 years old.<br /><br />The two main characters are mysterious--or at least their backgrounds are--and they seem to have uncommon abilities and talents. However, either as a result of this mystery or perhaps due to the pace of the book, the two characters are totally unrealistic. They barrel into problems without regard for consequences to themselves or to others (including each other). They show little to no fear, they are uncommonly lucky, and they seem to lack anything close to self-preservation instincts.<br /><br />But, if you don't care about that and want a quick fun read, this is it!<br /><br />CHILD SAFE: I ran the book through a profanity filter, but I don't think it needed it. There was no profanity that I could detect, and other than flirtation, there was no sexual content. Lots of action, but nothing graphic or grotesque.",4.0,1,2020

I've read other novels about African-Americans who over-valued light skin; I’ve read novels about running from one’s roots. In fact, I’ve read novels and memoirs that told the stories of passing and the emotional consequences far better than this novel.

The idea isn't bad, but I just didn't feel that the plot structure and world-building was strong and I felt the heroine was not really there.  She seemed swept along by the plot rather than being a strong part of the plot.  And that makes it hard to want to continue the tale.",3.0,0,2020
Had some bad contradictions,"In this world a catgirl is a specialized humanoid robot with a particular look.  They are all made by one company and there are secrets as part of that plot point.  (sorry, trying to avoid spoilers).<br /><br />However, while that is definitely important to the world and plot, the big part of this tale is the MC being invited into an underground fight club.  And that is what caused me to downgrade the book to 3 stars.  I know that underground fight clubs are occasionally used in fiction, but this one was not put together in any logical way.  And I never understood what the MC's motivation was other than money, which seemed less than compelling considering all the intrigue around the fighting.<br /><br />So the story just felt a bit flat with many of the characters not being as deep as I'd like.  (but I do tend to be extremely demanding in regards to characters so YMMV.)<br /><br />Fun, interesting, but just never rewarded me like I wanted.",3.0,0,2020
"Good book, lots of detail, but limited regarding the man himself","This is a well written book about a major figure in the Pacific War that is too often overlooked. The book provides a lot of details about Spruance’s campaigns that is generally available from other sources. I gave four stars not five because there’s not enough about the man himself. In the author’s defense, Spruance wasn’t a diarist and his personal papers reveal little about the man. The author interviewed as many surviving staff members as he could, and so we do get some insight. Ultimately though this book tends to be a bit dry because that personal element is lacking. For anyone interested in more than just an overview of the Pacific War, wanting to get more detail about the decisions and the commanders, this book is recommended reading. I wouldn’t start here, but if you want to get to the second level regarding the war, this book is worth your time.",4.0,1,2020
This series is one of the best I've read recently,"I'm going to do something I very rarely do and give a book 5 stars.  And I do it for one simple reason.  Jerry turns each one of these books into a fun page-turning romp where even emotionally charged scenes that could be very negative are handled in an adult way with reasonable levels of angst and passion.  The characters are easy to enjoy and grow naturally.  The character development in this book is impressive and well thought out.<br /><br />Its hard to put enough praise on the author or this series.  They are just fun books, with a fun premise that has grown over time.  Even the ending of this book is more positive than negative as it sets the tone for the next book without leaving someone thinking that its a cheap cliffhanger designed for force someone to read the next book.  (although I suspect most readers will desperately want to know what happens next.)<br /><br />In all this series has grown in me.  Its adult without being smut.  Its playful and fun without reducing characters to blithering idiots.  It has mysteries and surprises without forcing them.  It's just well written and fun.",5.0,1,2020
Welcome to Wit's End,"A young woman, Susan Witsend, has recently inherited, Wit's End, a charming and quirky B & B.  The B & B is located in the small mountain town of Doyle, California - a particularly eccentric place even by small mountain resort town standards - that is known as a UFO hot spot and the inn, 'Wit's End' capitalizes on this.  Susan is determined to become a successful innkeeper but when a guest is found dead, leaving her stuck with his now uncollectible overdue bill she begins to have doubts.  Things get more complicated when an FBI agent arrives to take charge, irritating the local police and exposing long concealed local secrets.<br /><br />This is a simple cozy mystery, the beginning of a new series a sort of spin off from an earlier one by this author.  There are some cross over characters from the earlier novels although it is by no means necessary to have read the earlier series to enjoy this one.  It is not great series literature so don't expect intricate, in-depth character development here, nor a story that will necessarily have a great impact on your life.  This is a simple fun read, a bit of a challenge to resolve the mystery before the main character.  There will be some questions left unanswered, one of which is a 'will they, won't they' romance - this is the first book in a series after all.  It is a fun read, something to take on a vacation or to use as an escape from every day life.",4.0,1,2020
Every dog owner needs this book!!,"I honestly don't know what I would've done without this book. I downloaded the Kindle version before we got our English Mastiff puppy, Beren, and I'm so glad I read it and made notes beforehand. He is almost 5 months old and a fantastic follower. He looks to me for everything, doesn't bark or jump, is already learning self-control, walks nice on a leash, loves his crate, and was potty trained within weeks! I've also realized from reading this all the mistakes my family made raising the dog I grew up with (she was such a struggle, like Marley & Me, and we had no idea WE were the issue!). Some people may think some of these methods are too ""strict"", but I'm here to say don't be fooled by common misconceptions, and trust me, THEY WORK. I was a former ""positive reinforcement only"" advocate, but with having a huge, strong pup with stubborn tendencies (plus small children in the house), those methods just don't work all the time (and I tried, just to make sure I was doing the right thing). Long story short, this book is a MUST for all puppy/dog owners. Can't recommend it enough!",5.0,1,2020
"Story is great despite its age, but this Kindle edition is riddled with textual errors","I read my first Heinlein book in the early 1960's, when I was about 8 - my older brother brought it home from the library. I've been reading and re-reading him ever since. Despite it's age, this remains a great story and is a good example of how diverse groups of people can choose to work together. I gave this book only three stars solely because the Kindle edition is riddled with errors. I assume this book was (poorly) scanned and not proof read. Flaws such as this: ""...I understand that you ate looking for..."", ""It was a factor be had not anticipated"", ""There was no love wasted. between them, but..."". While the Kindle edition is inexpensive, I'm disappointed that books with such shoddy proof reading and correction are being sold. Enjoy the story, it's still a fun read -- but know you're getting a very flawed copy of the original text.",3.0,0,2020
Yawn,"Acknowledging that celebrity bios are not my preferred reading, this is still not a very interesting read. It's a plot synopsis of a few episodes of Little House per season with a few amusing anecdotes. Seems like she wanted to remain a private person and not address the interpersonal tensions on set or her own life that pretty much every other book from the Little House cast has addressed. If you want to remain a private person, why write a book about your childhood acting career? One thing the book makes clear is that there were definitely the issues other cast members discuss but the fact she neglects to mention them made me think that discussion wouldn't cast her in a very good light.",3.0,0,2020
Too many Westcotts,"I am not tired of the Westcotts, well not too much,  it is having them all listed at every opportunity. I counted 10 on one page. Is Balogh being paid by name of characters ? And what's with all the references to what women can and cannot be exposed to? There is not one strong woman in the book. In fact she has the main character faint, it was not in character for the person she had formed, and was  a contrived and uncomfortable moment.",2.0,0,2020
My favorite series in CC's Shadow Hunters world,"This, though in the same world as The Mortal Instruments (and sandwiched between the first three and last three in the proposed reading order if you want to avoid ""spoilers""), has a very different feel! TMI is good, but very YA/UF with all the teenagery issues and angst. Daddy issues anyone? But, Infernal Devices does not really feel YA. Maybe, because of the time in which it takes place? A 17 year old in the Victorian Age would be much more adult than modern times...typically. Maybe, I'm not sure. The ages of the characters are basically the same, but this one doesn't FEEL YA, and it has a distinct Steampunk air that wouldn't work with TMI. Definitely fun. Will needs a good slap, but I imagine there's more to learn there. Otherwise, this was just a fun ride with endearing characters.",4.0,1,2020
Ok read.,"The characters were ok, the plot was ok. There was a lot of ok in this book. There were things that I could have really loved, if the circumstances were right. I could have loved the sweet declarations that the hero made about her after their first meeting; if he hadn’t went back to being a manho a couple of months after he met her and continued it for years. Unlike normal in these manho books I didn’t actually judge him for being with other girls after he met her, because it was one kiss. He tried to look for her for a while. However the vocal and inner monologue of feeling just became boring and eye-rolling after a while because he didn’t back it up. He says that he fell in love with her that night, which was really sweet. Had it really been love and faithfulness to her for no other reason than that he truly felt it? That would have made an amazing story (especially with this author and the types of heroes she writes). I can’t remember where I heard it, it’s from a movie but the phrase “real men work without a net” popped into my head more than once. As is, it made him seem childish, immature, and really cliche! The “I fell in love with her, but wouldn’t accidentally want to do work without the guarantee of a payoff so I’ll keep screwing other girls like always” thing has been done to DEATH! The jock that actually felt about a girl so deeply after one day that he knew she was different, even though it goes against all of his instincts but was still willing to back it up? That would have been a unique story worth reading. As is I didn’t hate the story, I just didn’t love it. Without the “feelings” aspect being believable, he didn’t really have any distinguishing characteristics that hooked me. He was pretty much just a “basic” guy, albeit a football player/ frat guy. Kudos to the author for not having the heroine just sitting at home lining for him though. I’m so tired of seeing that done to death. She moved in and had a relationship with a rock star f3?2! If he did end up being a dbag). The hero just didn’t trigger my swoon reflexes, who knows he might for someone else!",3.0,0,2020
A Glimpse Behind the Apron,"I've always loved The Music Man, Carousel, Oklahoma, and The Partridge Family and decided to read this autobiography as a break from the fiction I'd been reading. Right from the introduction Miss Jones warns the reader that they will not be reading about Marion, Julie, Laurey or Mrs. Partridge.<br /><br />The book is not very well written, vacillating between the past and present, which makes it difficult to follow. A chronological order would have been better for the story and the reader. Miss Jones seems to want to shock the reader and seem worldly and edgey.  It was an interesteing read but I wish she seemed happier with her public persona and knowing that's what people love her for.",3.0,0,2020
How many times in one day can the heroine drink alcohol?,"This seems to be a big point with her:  ""is there WINE, sherry, etc, in other words, BOOZE???????""<br /><br />It makes her out to be an alcoholic, in my view, and detracts too much from what otherwise is going on in the few chapters I have read so far, so I don't need this.",1.0,0,2020
